    "text": "my husband and i love biscuits and as in a previous review ,  love the theme .   did not know one needed to be right to enjoy the patriotism but do .   you are greeted like an old friend when you enter .   the food tastes good ,  which is why we keep going back .   we have lots of choices and the atmosphere and food are winners .   our 7 year old grandson went with us last weekend and the waitress really embellished his hot chocolate  -  his eyes almost popped out of his head .   he ate almost all of his very generous two eggs (more like three) ,  his bacon and two huge pancakes .     the biscuits and gravy are what we normally get  -  it is very tasty .    my only complaint would be the processed swiss cheese in the scrambles vs regular swiss but that is a small issue to me and i should not be eating any cheese anyway so i skip .     biscuits has free wireless .  yea !  !  !   yes ,  we are fans .

    "text": "this place is wonderful !  my fiance and i had the lunch  \" buffet \"  today .   it ' s not a buffet as far as the set up .  you don ' t go get your own food .  it is brought out to you .  they sit you down with a good sized menu ,  and you get to order whatever you want ,  as much as you want .  they prefer if you start out with an appetizer or something ,  because the sushi is made to order ,  and depending on how busy it is (every table was occupied at noon today) ,  you ' ll have a bit of a wait for it .  the lunch was $9 . 99 per person .  i don ' t know how you can possibly beat that !  i did not care for the ginger dressing on my salad .  it tasted quite bitter to me .  i also didn ' t really care for my tempura banana .  it was more of a texture thing for me .  once a banana gets heated up ,  it gets very mushy .  everything else was delicious .  items we ordered include shrimp shumai ,  gyoza ,  clear soup ,  house salad ,  edamame ,  tempura banana ,  fuji roll ,  hawaii roll ,  california roll ,  alaskan roll ,  philadelphia roll ,  and green sarabay roll .

    "text": "yet another fine hipster coffee shop in reno !  i am telling you kids reno is the new portland .  they have all the choices you would expect from a third wave coffee shop ,  beautiful fully manual espresso machines that are intregrated into the counter and are droll worthy in their beauty and function .  chemex and v60 for pour over fans and freaks ,  a selection of teas that is decent and some really gross versions of  \" cronuts \"  .  they also have some blends and concoctions that are good for the fans of the sugary bombs of starbucks and that ilk .   the space is pure hipster ,  simple clean ,  subway tile and wood ,  just a handful of tables inside and out and they have free wifi and clean bathrooms .    baristas are way friendlier than the surly folks in sf and the west coast and the prices are cheaper too than in the usual hipster towns .

    "text": "couple of notable impressions:   -  the first thing that got me was the decor of the place .  chopsticks were made out of red plastic ,  and the napkin was just paper ,  not cloth .  water came out in glass cups .  the impression was overall a little cheap ,  which surprised me .  on the other hand ,  the servers did keep water refilled well and tea was presented immediately .    -  a lot of the reviews remark that the dishes are very spicy .  i was surprised to discover it was pretty tame .  the dan dan noodles come in at a 6 and it was imperceptible .  we got another dish coming in at an 8 which also was hard to notice .  not sure what the explanation might be since i don ' t consider myself to be especially tolerant ,  but perhaps i ' m more so than i think ?    -  service was very fast .  i think our food came out within ten minutes .  certainly the dan dan noodles were instantaneous .    -  finally ,  the food itself is delicious .  the dan dan noodles especially .  i also had some kind of dumplings and an entree ,  i unfortunately can ' t remember the names ,  but both were enjoyable as well .    -  the bill was a bit pricey .  i think they give a lot of food for two ,  so it ' s may be justified ,  just unwanted for two relatively small people .  fortunately ,  they make taking it home easy if that ' s something you ' d like .   edit:   -  after visiting a second time with a large group ,  i discovered they have a very nice seating area for groups (to the right and somewhat below ground) .  we got a circular table which i really liked for discussion .  definitely would have appreciated a turntable ,  but no big deal .    -  a tip from our server: the spice tends to be the kind that creeps up rather than is entirely overt .  besides water ,  consuming tea and rice helps to reduce the effect of the spice .

    "text": "this is one of our frequent late - night stops ,  after we ' ve gotten tired of the loud bars and are looking for a more quiet but still lively place to wrap up a night .  we always go on saturday nights and have never had to wait for a spot at the bar .   i actually don ' t drink liquor ,  so village whiskey may seem like an odd choice of locations ,  but they have a fantastic beer selection too .  honestly ,  i stopped here because it ' s a garces joint and i would drink toilet water if he put it in a bowl with some cilantro .  plus ,  my boyfriend loves their whiskeys .  and so do the other guests ,  which makes this place so fun: the last time we were there we ended up joining booths with our neighbors so that we could all talk about the restaurant and their liquor choices .  it ' s a very cool ,  very like - minded crowd .   food wise you can ' t go wrong with duck fat french fries .  i feel like i don ' t even need to say that ,  because come on .  .  .  duck .  fat .  french .  fries .  we also go for the cheese puffs on their late night menu as well: a hot pan of ping - pong ball sized bread balls coated in cheese and broiled and delicious and .  .  .  oh boy now i ' m ,  hungry .   and if the other reviews aren ' t clear enough .  .  .  their burgers will have you singing hymns of praise to the meat gods .

    "text": "gluten free pasta .  .  . i had to try .  plus ,  1/2 price wine mon - thurs did not disappoint .   the selection was just right .   we found street parking as the lot was full ,  and at 7pm waited a bit for a table as they don ' t accept reservations for parties of less than 6 .   to start ,  we ordered the escargot ,  and it came from the kitchen screaming hot .  so hot ,  the cheese had broken .  i was looking forward to the crunchy brown bits to munch on but only had a couple of small bits that survived .   as a celiac ,  i couldn ' t dunk for the garlic butter ,  and they didn ' t bring any bits for my dining companion to dunk after i had finished .   our server was more than helpful ,  we could have asked ,  but wondered if this was how it was usually served .   next i ordered the daily special  -  squid ,  mussels and shrimp with a garlic butter sauce and gluten free penne corn pasta .   i ' m not usually a fan of a single ingredient gluten free pasta  -  corn tends to be a bit dry and fussy .   tonight was not much of an exception .     tasty ?  oh my yes .  but again ,  without (gluten free) bread or bun to soak up that beautiful garlic butter sauce  -  a bit sad .   the seafood was cooked to perfection ,  and i don ' t get to say that very often .   the penne .  .  .  well ,  stab it with a fork and some broke in half .  a large spoon would have been a great addition to the dish for scooping .   i think i managed ok ,  because i ate almost all of it and forgot to take pictures !   my dining companions all finished their meals and had desserts which looked fantastic  -  tiramisu was beautiful and large !  some would share it ,  but for others ,  it ' s just right .    be prepared to leave by 9:30pm on a thursday ,  as the cleaners apparently come soon after !  (i ' ve never heard that before ,  but .  .  . ok . )  not every establishment can handle gluten free ingredients or diners ,  but they did well .   they weren ' t certain if the gelato was safe ,  and probably cross - contamination from others might be an issue ,  so good call by our waitress .   i ' m looking forward to the single serving packages of buns from certain gluten free bakers (wink wink) that might make it easier for restaurants to thaw only one at a time (yes ,  you have to keep them frozen until serving  -  they get dried out ,  inedible and gross pre - thawed) .   i believe we will return to try more items on their menu .

    "text": "a little outside of downtown indianapolis is an area called broad ripple ,  and here you can find a place that transports you to a modern pristine parisian bakery .  you literally walk in and no longer feel like you are in indiana .  everything is sparkly and glittery ,  and the smells are divine .    we made the trek by uber to this neighborhood and really wanted to try this place !  we arrived around 11 for an  \" early lunch \"  slash  \" snack \"  .  we ordered the quiche of the day which was quiche lorraine and the famous earls court chocolate cake .   the quiche was quite delicious .  the egg was so fluffy and savory while the crust was super flaky and had a great bacon flavor .   this was a perfect snack to split between 2 people and just hit the spot !   it was so hard to decide which cake to try .  one gripe that i have about this place is the price of the cake slices .  the slices are quite large and pricey .  if you only come with 2 people it is hard to get a few things to share without either breaking the bank or stuffing your face with dessert .  i asked if we could do 1/2 slices ,  but was politely denied .  a suggestion i have would be to allow fractions of slices so people can try multiple different cakes .   my wife loves chocolate and i love all sweets so we opted for the famous chocolate cake .  there was so much great chocolate flavor and for the most part ,  the cake was super moist .  it seemed like the edges of the cake might have been a little over cooked/on the dryer side but the flavor was delightful !

    "text": "this restaurant gets its name from the fresh olive bread they serve  -  which is wonderful !  the menu is rooted in old world mediterranean fare ,  but has a slight modern flair ,  too .  the weather was wonderful ,  so even though the outside eating area overlooks the parking area ,  we opted to sit outside .  the grape vines on the trellises were beautiful and healthy and just about to burst into fruit !    our entrees included the walnut encrusted trout ,  seafood linguine  -  clams ,  shrimp ,  white fish ,  mussels ,  over bed of linguine ,  and a lamb kofte special .   the trout was a healthy serving and perfectly prepared .  clams ,  mussels and shrimp over a bed of linguine was another healthy portion and half ended up in a to - go box !  again ,  delicious ,  attractively presented and perfectly prepared .   lamb is a personal favorite ,  but if i had it to do over again ,  i would ' ve opted for something else .  it tasted ok (meat was a bit dry)  but less than appealing appearance - wise: looked like two crisscrossed sausages .  it came with a very thin (runny) yogurt cucumber sauce  -  not the standard tzatziki one would expect .  entrees will run you about $22 ,  pastas around $16 - 18 ,  so it ' s not overly pricey ,  but the addition of a couple adult beverages or bottle of wine can change that in a heartbeat .   all in all ,  it ' s a nice place with good food and attentive service .  we all voted we would be back .

    "text": "better than any of the thai i have tried in or around downtown st louis or grand !   i ' ll gladly make the trek from south city to o ' fallon to get this delicious ,  superior and value thai .   having been twice ,  i am ashamed to admit that i am addicted to their drunken noodles so i have had that each visit ,  albeit once chicken and once pork .   the appetizers are delicious .   have tried the spring rolls ,  chicken satay and chicken pot - stickers and they were all satisfying .   the waiter/waitress will ask you what level you want your heat if you get a spicy dish .   they ask you on a scale of 1 to 4 .   first visit i asked for 3 and the dish was very nice .   last visit i went 4 and while it was definitely a  \" sinus opening experience \"  the food is pleasantly hot without any of the ill side - effects later on .  .  . if you know what i mean .   the menu has over 100 items on it and while some of the other reviews complain of the vegetables being  \" not fresh \"  i can only compare aroy with the pricey city thai i ' ve had in/around st louis and i put aroy equal of better with huge portion sizes at very reasonable prices .   each visit i have found the service to be attentive and available .   once during saturday lunch rush and another post - lunch afternoon .   walk - in takeout service seemed very quick for those i observed on my visits .   i ' ve been to thailand a few times and while you ' ll never beat home - cooked thai with exported fare ,  i have nothing bad to say about aroy thai .   it ' s where i ' ll be taking my out - of - town guests and where i ' ll go for takeout when the urge hits .    looking forward to my next visit to explore more of their menu choices .  .  . unless those drunken noodles get me again !

    "text": "we took a break from sesame place and ate some real food here before heading back to elmo for a final beating ,  aka: the sesame parade and fireworks show .    if this wasn ' t the sweet haven of amazingness between furry monsters and sweat ,  i really cannot attest to what the heck a sweet haven is .    i ate steak ,  delicious steak ,  instead of a grilled cheese at elmo - bites .  because i found out that elmo can really bite .  he is a monster after all .    the servers are so great with kids and yet you sit in that swanky dark mahogany bar atmosphere and feel like you are human again after a day at sesame place .  i actually think jb dawson ' s is the reason we went back after our dinner .  i downed my steak and two beers ,  looked at my adorable 3 year old who was quietly coloring on the kid menu they have ,  turned to my husband and said ,   \" wanna be parents of the year ,  and take her back to see the parade ?  \"  swiftly ,  he responded ,   \" let ' s do it .  go big or go home .  \"   all the waitstaff works together here too .  i don ' t know if they pool tips ,  but it ' s like some sorta family feeling they give you as if the waitress '  big brother just took over her shift so she could go help mom in the kitchen .  so rare to find fast ,  efficient ,  and dependable hosting like that in a restaurant these days .    being from new york city and eating at an array of places over the years (with plenty of annoyed waitstaff) ,  this place reminded me of gorgios of gramercy in terms of atmosphere and service .  and it was child friendly which always scores well with me .   my only constructive criticism: my newborn has a dairy allergy and an overwhelming majority of the dishes and sides have butter ,  milk ,  or cheese in them .  they made me a beautiful plate of steak ,  but all the higher priced sides i was supposed to get ,  i could not have .  so i paid the same amount for two less filling sides .  .  .  . basically steamed broccoli (which was actually amazing) and fries .  an additional side of something small like corn or rice ,  would have made it even - steven .  but i loved my meal .  i ' d go back .

    "text": "ate on a saturday around 2 pm  -  since it was a later lunch there were tons of available tables ,  which was nice .    apple tree goat cheese with basil pesto bruschetta  -  so good .  this one was my favorite of the two we tried .   pistachio herbed ricotta with lavender honey bruschetta  -  this was my husbands favorite bruschetta  -  it was also very good !   roasted beet salad  -  loved it .  there was a lot of goat cheese ,  so if you don ' t care for it as much ,  then ask for them to go light on it .  i love goat cheese myself ,  so it worked out well .  it was light ,  but there was enough to make lunch filling .   claudio mozzarella sandwich  -  4/5 stars  -  really tasty .  he thinks it would have been better if the prosciutto weren ' t crispy since he felt it lost some of its flavor .    flourless chocolate torta  -  a good end to the meal .  not too much  -  just enough for two people !    this was probably our favorite meal we had in philadelphia and would definitely recommend !

(hint  -  delicia ,  you ' d do really well in san diego if you opened another restaurant there ,  and we ' d comee to visit you often ! )  the service was good ;  the atmosphere was nice ,  and the food was amazing !     we started with the guacamole ,  the ceviche ,  and the queso fundido .   the quac was okay ,  but i prefer it simple ,  with less stuff in it .   the queso fundido was delicious ,  as was the cevice .   oh  -  the specialty cocktails were interesting and refreshing .   i was surprised ,  though that when i asked for a kioki coffee ,  the waiter said he didn ' t know what it was and they couldn ' t serve me one .   really ?   usually ,  if they haven ' t heard of it ,  they ' ll google it ,  and then fix one for me .  nope .   but they did serve me a delicious irish coffee .   the entrees were the stars of the meal .   among the four of us ,  we had the duck enchiladas (enchiiladas de pato) ,  the aji  a la gallino (a chicken dish) ,  and the tamal corn cakes .   all three were presented beautifully and were outstanding .   the rice served with them was very bland .  ,  but the entrees themselves were spectacular .  ,  with the corn cakes (served with barbacoa beef) were my favorite .     generous protions .   i took half of mine home for lunch the next day and enjoyed it just as much@  when i left ,  i was sad  -  sad that we only come here once or twice a year and we won ' t be able to come back until then !   what was good was soooo good ,  that they get five stars despite the minor flaws .     many gluten - free options too ,  which was wonderful for one in our group !

    "text": "this place started for us as a quick stop to grab a bubble tea for my wife and i .  it was nice and convenient ,  located very close to my wife ' s work .  on days that i would show up early to pick her up from work ,  i would find myself coming up with excuses to get a bubble tea for her and a smoothie for myself .  this practice has aided in earning me a brownie point or two over the years .  the quality of the smoothie/ bubble tea bar is 5 - star .   about 1 year ago a taiwanese friend of ours paid us a visit ,  and we decided to try the actual restaurant .  they have plenty of the typical american chinese food such as orange chicken ,  but our friend recommended actual taiwanese dishes .  the results were a little mixed .  some of the dishes were absolutely amazing ,  while others were quite weird .  overall the quality was very good (based on the opinion of our taiwanese friend) ,  even if some of the dishes were a little outside our comfort zone .   to sum it up ,  if you want a good bubble tea or smoothie ,  you won ' t find much better in reno .  if you want to give legitimate taiwanese food a try ,  this is a great place to start .

    "text": "aside from a few negatives ,  i really enjoyed this place .  mizu is at the end of the washington street bars across from prime 1000 .  we had a reservation for the night but were seated at the table right by the front door .  the hostess (who i think was the owner) understood that this was problematic as the door closes slowly and it was under 20 outside .  when another table in a better part of the restaurant opened up ,  she reseated us .    our server was very nice and accommodating .  we started off with an appetizer of dragon balls and seaweed salad .  both were very good .  the server also brought a complimentary order of miso soup .    for our entrees ,  we had the imperial roll ,  volcano roll ,  and salmon skin hand rolls .  the imperial roll and volcano roll both are served over a plate of fire which makes presentation unique .  although the volcano roll was good ,  it was exceeded by the flavor in the imperial roll .  it had an open bbq taste which was unique for a sushi roll .    prices were adequate for what we received especially since we were eating off of washington st .   for all of the items above (no drinks) we spent ~$60 plus tip .   if you are looking for a downtown spot for sushi ,  mizu offers a unique experience with a large selection of items and good service .  the only negatives are parking (as with all the washington establishments) and the seating .  i know it seems petty but the whole place gets cold when that door is open .  even in the new seats at the other end of the restaurant we could feel a draft .  my gf wore her coat throughout the meal .

    "text": "we ate here last night during the 6:00 pm rush .  we shared an order of fried pickles and i had the pork tacos .  the fried pickles were decent and the tacos were excellent !  good flavor and great texture .  i ' ll definitely be having those again !  don ' t bother deciding on your sides until you get up to the counter and can see the board because they do not have everything on the menu every day .  the mac and cheese was so good !  it wasn ' t what i expected from a bbq place !  the  \" baked beans \"  we ' re also good but they are really mixed beans and not at all like the bbq baked beans you get at other places .  still good ,  just not baked .   they also had abita strawberry and the blackforest kolsch .  excellent bar selection !  !  i ' m docking them a star because of the system of ordering at the counter and then taking the plastic number to a table .  this system works in theory ,  and in practice at other places ,  but you have to keep people from  \" saving tables \"  when they have yet to order .  i get it if you have a group of 10 but for normal sized tables ,  it throws the whole system off !  the line was long last night but the food comes out fast so tables turn over quickly .  by the time we ordered there were no open tables .  there were around 8 tables taken up by people who were still 20 minutes from ordering .  that throws the whole system off !  let people who have already ordered eat .  another table will open up for you by the time you order !  this can easily be solved by posting a sign and asking the servers to enforce it .   luckily there were two spots open at the bar .   on a side note ,  the bartender was awesome: fast ,  attentive ,  and knowledgeable .  i may just sit there in the first place next time !

    "text": "been here a few times since my gf and i live by and like the outdoor seating area .  the regular menu has always been pretty consistent with their fish & chips and old charlestown shrimp .  appetizers are a bit expensive for what you get but they are good .  the staff has always been nice and offer to bring out water for our dog when bring him so thats huge for us .    we finally realized they had a happy hour and walked away with mixed results .  the menu has a good selection between food and drinks at different prices .  we had a few food items including the baja tacos ,  nachos and calamari .  the one baja taco (for $5 ,  reg $7 . 50) was good but for $5 i personally hoped for more than one or for something special with the tortilla .  the fish itself was pretty damn good but the tortilla tasted fresh from the supermarket .  having been spoiled by fresh tortillas elsewhere this was disappointing .  the nachos plate was packed but the plate was small so all the cheese and few beans were on top with nothing on the chips hidden below .  but the calamari was very good and came with a good amount .    i would stick with the regular menu or if happy hour has to be tried stick with the drinks and calamari .

    "text": "super prompt delivery to the hotel best western royal plus and open late .  it seemed a little pricey at $23 for 8 wings ,  a capri salad (which was sizable) ,  and zucchini sticks .  delivery person was friendly as well and seemed to be used to coming to the hotel for such requests as he called to verify that my room was near the pool .   all of the food was really tasty and very fresh .  when i placed my order the guy said it would be 45 mins .  i almost said  \" forget it \"  but went ahead anyway .  glad i did since my order arrived in about 20 mins instead .  it was piping hot !  my only suggestions is be sure to ask for cutlery and napkins .  i had to go to the front desk to get these things since they did not include them .  guess i was supposed to eat with my hands .   still and yet ,  the food was really tasty .  the 8 buffalo wings were cooked perfect and the sauce was just enough .  the zucchini sticks were plenty ;  at least 12 of them and really fresh too .  the salad was packed in the box filled with yummy greens ,  red onions ,  tomato ,  mozzerella cheese pieces ,  and basil .  i asked for balsamic dressing and it was a great flavor together .

    "text": "last weekend my girlfriend and i  ,  both half insane with cabin fever ,  decided to walk up to girard ave and grab a bite to eat and a couple drinks .  as we strolled we listed off our choices trying to make the decision as we walked .  .  . east girard gastropub ,  kraftwork ,  frankford hall ,  interstate 295 .  .  . all good places to which we have already been .  but as we passed each one they all looked like sardine cans .  instead of sardines they were packed with humans .  humans that smelled worse than fish in a can .  so ,  we kept on .    then we passed lloyd and decided to give it a try .  my girlfriend loves whiskey ,   the menu looked interesting ,  and it was busy ,  but not filled to the gills .  so ,  in we went .   my immediate reaction to the decor/ambiance was that it felt like an upscale vfw .  the bar is adorned with mismatched stuffed armchairs (cozy ! ) and fun vintage wall art that has a cabin in the woods and/or dark pool hall feel .  there was something just a little off on the overall vibe .  i got the sense that the owners had a limited budget to dedicate towards the design and decor .  maybe it was the startlingly white acoustical grid ceiling ,  or the pergo floors that make that dreadful hollow knocking sounds when you walk across them ,  or maybe it was the off - the - shelf white folding residential closet door covering what i assume was a storage closet .  this sounds overly nit - picky ,  but when i think  \" whiskey bar \"  i imagine a dark ,  dimly lit ,  cozy space with dark (real) wood accents and leather .  also ,  it lacked a good seating area adjacent to the bar .  a overly wide space between the tables and bar felt like an unused dance floor .    but enough about the design of the space .  now to the important part .  the food .   i got suckered into some special cocktail that was made with a whiskey that aged for 6 months in some special aged oak barrel .  it was yummy ,  but at $13 a pop  -  i didn ' t go for another round .  for food bits we got roasted beets in a siracha honey glaze ,  chicken liver mousse pate with bread ,  and a mozzarella & prosciutto with broccoli rabe sandwich .  i loved the beets and the chicken liver .  the sandwich was  good ,  but basic .  there wasn ' t a crumb left on any of the plates and the servings were pretty generous .   the two cocktails my ladyfriend had were also super yummy ,  and a much more reasonable $9 a piece .   overall i enjoyed my experience .  the service was very good ,  the food hit the spot .  i would go back again to try their other offerings .  i only dwell so long on the ambiance of the place because i think they have a good thing going ,  but in a town like philly where there are so many good restaurants with great atmosphere and design ,  a restaurant has to do more than make good food to survive long term .  i hope this place continues to do well .  it ' s great having another quality place to go to in fishtown .

    "text": "from the outside of the cafe ,  you don ' t really expect the inside to be that great .   but to my surprise ,  it was greatly decorated in thai decor .   i liked the ambience and feel to it ,  because it kind of made me feel like it was an exotic escape especially from the surrounding neighborhood .     there was plenty of seating which was great .   most thai restaurants i ' ve visited have been a little smaller and more intimate ,  and this place gives you enough breathing room .   coming from chicago ,  my favorite place near the uic campus was thai bowl on taylor st .   cheap and good thai food with a student discount and delivers to the dorms .     the food was great ,  and having a thai friend order food that i wasn ' t familiar with was all the better .   i ' m more of an  \" eat what you know \"  type of person ,  and sometimes i ' m scared to venture out .   but the tom kha (sp ? )  -  coconut (milk) soup was delicious .   i have to say i ' m not a fan of either mushrooms or coconut ,  but i have to say it was a great combination .     now to my usual order of pad see ew ,  i wasn ' t too impressed .   it seems like this place ,  along with smiling elephant and royal thai ,  all make their pad see ew with thinner (almost transparent) noodles .   i enjoy having my pad see ew with thicker noodles ,  that ' s basically my only complaint .     the service was great because i went during a less busy time (i ' d say mid - afternoon) .     i ' m definitely coming back here again .    this place beats royal thai .   and i would probably choose this place over smiling elephant because siam cafe has more seating available .

    "text": "update: happy hour .  3 . 5 stars .  i really hate to downgrade places i do genuinely like ,  but  .  .  i have to be objective .  i did my research on places downtown offering happy hour specials and based on what ' s advertised i picked tryst for a gathering of 4 .   we were seated promptly outside .  the location and the view are excellent !  the outside decor is cozy and elegant .  i asked the hostess what the happy hour specials were and she told me they don ' t have any .  i asked our waitress the same question ,  and she pointed to the section of the menu that lists the offerings .  the happy hour specials before 7 pm are half off house wine ,  some beers ,  well liquor and appetizer specials .  we took advantage of the half off house wine -  excellent malbec !  the problem was with the appetizers .  there weren ' t any .  the menu clearly states  - half off appetizer specials .   we were told that they are in the process of changing the menu and currently there are no appetizer specials .  my personal belief is that if something is offered ,  especially in writing ,  it should be honored and delivered .  oh ,  well .  .  .  the food -  it was very good !  i ' m not a fan of calamari ,  and i would never order them .  after tasting my friend ' s calamari i did put in my own order .  they were that good -  tender and juicy !  the serving was very much on the small side .    the bison carpaccio was very good as well .  the house pesto underneath was absolutely delicious !   we also shared the pork tacos and a cuban sandwich .  both were decent ,  nothing special ,  but nonetheless good .   our waitress ,  by the way ,  was fantastic !  i have enjoyed her service before and she ' s always done a great job !

    "text": "1  fried meat dumplings  $ 5 . 25 1  general tso ' s dinner box  $ 7 . 75  i gave this a four stars but let me clarify .  it is what it is .  it ' s greasy unhealthy american - chinese food thats cheap and has way too much salt .  you know they don ' t serve general tso ' s in china right ?  but for what it is it ' s a cheap and solid dinner .  the general tso ' s dinner box is is a typical combo of egg roll rice and the chicken .  it ' s pretty good but i ' d only say it ' s an average 3 stars ,  nothing sticks out .  the real reason i order from golden chopsticks quite often is their fried meat dumplings .  these are the thick heavy doughy dumplings ,  not the thin potstickers you might be used to and you get 8 with an order for less than 6 bucks .  it ' s a lot of food and make sure you sleep with water next to your bed because it ' s very salty ,  in a good way .  so again for what they are aiming for ,  they do a pretty decent job .  don ' t skip on the dumplings !

    "text": "i used to live a few doors down from las cazuelas in 2005 and went there faithfully because the food is delicious !  i dont '  know if they still make it ,  but the chilean sea bass with pumpkin mole was one of the tastiest things i ' ve ever eaten .   my husband and i visited last sunday for brunch and we ordered a ton of food because we had a $50 gift certificate to use up .  i can highly reccommend the huevos divorciados and the omlette poblano .  i am a poblano and mushroom lover and the oaxaca cheese melts into the eggs and veggies in the most wonderful way .  my husband had the divorciados and it was both unusual and tasty !   my favorite at las cazuelas are the tacos -  the steak with fresh onions and cilantro is by far the winner in my book and i confess ,  i have dreamed of them and often cannot resist the urge to go get a big plate of them !  we tried the marinated steak tacos this time and did not like them very much -  there was a red coating of marinade on the steak and it was overwhelming .  you could not taste the yummy ,  meat - y ,  grilled flavor that is so great in the regular steak tacos .  my husband loved the shredded pork tacos and i thought they were ok .  the shrimp tacos are always a winner and taste fresh ,  crisp and light .  i suppose it is the pure flavors and how they usually treat the fresh ingredients that brings me back time and again ,  i will veer away from the overly marinated items in the future .  as always ,  the cafe de olla (coffee with cinnamon +) and desserts are very good .  i tell everyone about this place and always bring it up as an option when we have folks in from out of town .  keep up the great work !  !

    "text": "great spot for big groups !  order at least $400 dollars worth of food in the large 3rd floor karaoke room and get the room for free (for 3 hours) .  the karaoke machine is fairly up to date ,  plus they have the actual music videos .  food is good as well !    went on a friday from 8 - 11 for a friend ' s birthday .  we had probably 40 people in the room and we fit pretty comfortably .  you have to order for the whole group (and they ' ll bring out the same dishes to each table) but so much food comes out and it ' s all pretty good so there shouldn ' t be an issue where someone has nothing they want to/can eat .  the food is pretty standard for chinatown in terms of taste and options ,  but if you ' re not sure what to get some popular dishes are: walnut shrimp ,  salt baked squid ,  steamed pot fish ,  and any veggie dish .  just get whatever you want ,  it ' ll all be good .   *they ' re also really nice in dealing with drunken/rowdy groups ,  so this is where large groups go to get smashed .

    "text": "for years ,  i have lamented about the lack of good cajun food in philly .  thank you ,  beck ' s ,  for filling this gaping void .  i think the first time i tried this place ,  it may have been in part because the line at dinic ' s was unbearably long and the throngs of people waiting were spilling over into beck ' s stall space (they are next to each other) .  .  .  and boy am i glad my inner fatty couldn ' t wait another minute because i just don ' t know what i ' d do without this jumbalaya !    i will note that the service here is a bit terrible .  don ' t get me wrong  -  everyone is very nice ,  but  .  .  .  slow - moving .  very slow moving .  i have never seen a more inefficient operation in my life ,  but like i said ,  they are super pleasant and helpful so you forgive them for taking 10+ minutes to pack  your order and collect payment (note: i ' ve been there at least 4x and it ' s been true every single time) .    as an example of the employees '  niceness/helpfulness ,  as an fyi ,  they do let you sample pretty much any of the entrees so you can make sure it ' s not too spicy or too peppery etc for you .   also ,  no credit card machine here so bring cash .   what we ate *jumbalaya: perfect .  perfect .  and it ' s surprisingly spicy !  it ' s less saucy then some jumbalayas i have had ,  but still really flavorful and the rice is perfectly cooked .  they also usually spoon on a bit of sauce on top and adds that extra flavor .  if you get the right cashier ,  she will upsell you the cornbread  -  get it  -  and eat it together .  they ' re not messing around when they say the cornbread + jumbalaya flavors complement each other like whoa .     *etouffee  -  the flavors of the bell peppers were a bit too strong for my personal liking ,  but i could appreciate the complexity of the flavors and the spiciness here as well .  my friends really liked this dish ,  so i did want to mention .    *oyster po ' boy  -  i thought the fried oyster was great .  the breading they use to coat the po boy sandwich meats (and oysters) are really tasty and not overwhelming .  i wish there was more oyster in the sandwich itself ,  but that would be the only complaint .    *beignets  -  warm and delightfully light fried dough and generous dusting of powdered sugar make this dessert just decadent enough .    *praline cookies  -  these were decent ,  but not the best i ' ve ever had .  the color was a bit darker than i was used to (more coffee with a splash of milk rather than latte color) and it almost tasted like they had burned/overcooked the butter or brown sugar .    beck ' s also has this authentic root beer from new orleans available .  i ' m not a root beer fan so haven ' t tried ,  but i keep hearing awesome things about it .

    "text": "ml rose has always been a favorite burger dive bar of mine ,  though i tend to visit the location on charlotte avenue .  when my work declared happy hour at this location ,  how could i not resist beating rush hour traffic to order my favorite craft beers ?   now ,  i ' m a fan of porters and stouts ,  so ml rose never disappoints .  this time ,  i ordered the highland black mocha stout from asheville ,  nc which went down ever - so smoothly .  it was quite frankly like drinking velvet .  i ' ve had the japa milk chai stout in the past and was similarly thrilled .  ml rose is to beer as nashville is to country music: it is the definitive marker of what beer goes .  period .   if you happen to be a huge fan of bar food ,  this location does not disappoint .  i particularly appreciated the generous portion on my carolina sweets order .  so ,  let me explain this magnificent paragon of culinary achievement: perfectly crunchy sweet potato waffle fries hugged by dollops of pulled pork ,  all smothered with a carolina mustard bbq and kissed by a few diced green onions .  talk about food that hits every tastebud high note: savory ,  sweet ,  sour ,  and (with a kick of hot sauce from your table) just a bit spicy .  i suggest saving the entire plate for yourself because you will not be inclined to share .  trust me ,  this dish inspires selfishness in us all .  while i have tried the five alarm burger ,  i admit that what truly sticks out is the caroline sweets dish due to satisfaction alone .  bar none .   because we did come in such a large party ,  i do believe the waitstaff struggled to handle the numbers .  beers were delivered late or could not be ordered due to busyness ,  orders were forgotten or delivered to the wrong people .  common mishaps considering the huge party that we made up .  however ,  the quality of my food and beer were still spot on ,  despite my beer gazing at me from afar (for far too long) .    i would suggest the charlotte location if you are looking for a less busy location ,  but this one is fun since it has a lovely beer garden in the back .  eat ,  drink ,  be merry at m . l .  rose .  it ' s diner paradise for sure .

    "text": "fireside pizza is located in the  \" historical \"  downtown part of palm harbor .  . it is another of a new breed of restaurant that i have noticed is starting to pop up around the state in that it ' s a high end wood fired pizzeria that also serves high end beer and wine .  . this is definitely one of the better ones i have been to .  .  . first the beer menu is fantastic .  .  . whomever is choosing it knows their beer .  .  . lots of great  \" national \"  craft beers from founders .  . stone .  . etc ,  but than many stellar local ones from the likes of cigar city  .  . 7th sun .  . etc .  .  . as for the food ,  everything i have had so far has been great .  .  . salads are done well .  .  .  . the hot wings are cooked in the pizza oven and served with crunchy onions on them .  . these are worth the trip here alone .  .  . the pizzas have all been good as well .  . the wood oven gives the thin crust a crunchy snap that is tough to match .  .  . pepperoni and sausage version has received high praise ,  but my personal favorite is one of their specialty pizzas ,  the parma ,  which has prosciutto and arugula on it .  . just fabulous .  . if i was just rating on the beer and food this place is a 5 star all the way .  .  . the only problems i have with fireside are it ' s pretty small inside and outside on the patio so there is not much seating ,  so as you can imagine the wait times can be pretty long on a lot of nights .  .  . even calling in takeout orders we have been quoted one hour plus pick - up times  , obviously due to the fact they are crowded and the brick oven can only hold so many pizzas at once .  .  . the crowds and the fact that the servers here always seem to be in a grumpy mood(maybe due to always being busy) makes me have to deduct a star .  .  . well that and the fact that last time we were there the utter chaos in the parking lot at the redneck bar across nebraska had all of us diners on the patio at fireside hoping we were not going to end up as collateral damage from the rapidly escalating conflict !  !  .  .  .  .  fireside is definitely a recommended spot if you like high end pizza and craft beer and don ' t mind paying a little more for such high quality fare .  . just try to go at an  \" off \"  hour and watch the parking lot across the street to make sure  \" all ' s quiet on the western front \"  and you will have a great meal and time",

    "text": "haven ' t been back for quite awhile (they had a kitchen fire late in 2015) but the return visit was as good as the last .  the atmosphere in the bar area (we have not eaten in the dining room) is great ,  with friendly servers and bartenders .  sitting at a hight top gave us a great vantage point to observe the bar action as well as the main entrance .   in addition to a great bar menu it is possible to order off the main menu as well .  carol opted for a light meal and had truffled fries and pork belly tacos .  the tacos had freshly prepared pickled onions on top that were terrific .  the fries were hot ,  crispy and had a great taste .  i chose the fried chicken ,  something i would not normally order and it was excellent !  the chicken came with collard greens and bacon ,  again ,  something i wouldn ' t normally order .  i forgot to mention that the meal started off with some very good bread .   my only complaint is that their beer selection is lacking  -  they need to add some craft beers ,  local if possible .

    "text": "very accommodating !   i say this because i ate here last week ,  which was not to long ago ,  for a friend ' s birthday .  there were about 7 of us ,  total .  i called twice to change the reservation time ,  and they were very polite about it .   we were worried about not being able to eat here because we found out one of my friends has a peanut allergy .  knowing the way asian restaurants work ,  a lot of them use peanut oil or peanut products in their food .   three people that worked there came up to our table to listen to our orders to make sure that they got it right ,  and to omit any peanuts in the dishes .  i believe one of them might have been the manager .  if that isn ' t good service ,  i don ' t know what is !   we ordered the roti canai (indian pancake) ,  shrimp puff ,  young chow fried rice ,  hainanese chicken ,  sizzling beef ,  shrimp pad thai ,  deep fried shrimp with ginger soy sauce .   the roti is probably their most famous dish .  once you try it you ' ll know why .  as soon as we sat down i asked if we could order an appetizer to start (since everyone was hungry and it was already 8pm) .  she asked if i wanted roti and how many ,  before i could even ask what i wanted .  how ' d she know ?  two please !   the shrimp puff was so delicious !  i ' m warning you though to let it sit for a bit and give it 5 minutes .  it is served hot and will burn your tongue .  the sauces tend to squirt out into your mouth as soon as you bite into it ,  which is no fun when it ' s extremely hot !  wait it out and you ' ll thank me later .  the sauce was a nice touch to the shrimp puff .  very cohesive appetizer .  you should definitely try this one .   fried rice was average ,  as any asian restaurant ' s fried rice is .   hainanese chicken was very different  .  .  .  never had anything like it .  it ' s completely baked but served at room temperate so it gives off the feeling that it ' s being served  \" cold \"  .  it ' s actually pretty good with the soy sauce (which is served under the chicken) if you can get over the way it looks and the cold texture .  we we ' re actually served a piece that was still blue and looked like a cyanotic chicken extremity which turned me off completely ,  even being in the medical field .  shivers .  we decided just to set it aside and remove it so we wouldn ' t have to look at it anymore .   the sizzling beef was absolutely .  .  forgettable .  do not get this dish .  it lacked flavor ,  and did not come out sizzling .  womp ,  womp .   the pad thai is also just an average dish .  nothing too special going on ,  probably would not get it again since i could get better pad thai elsewhere .   now i saved the best part for last .  .  the deep fried fish !  it normally comes with other sauces ,  but we requested to do a simple ginger and soy sauce .  this is the best fried fish ,  ever !  we all couldn ' t get our hands off it and fought for the last morsel !  main reason it was so good was because it was so crispy !  good to share due to it ' s size .  fairly big .  i would totally go back for this .   parking could be difficult during the weekend due to it ' s location ,  so try an odd weeknight .  like say ,  a thursday .

    "text": "we made the journey through the cold and snow ,  all the way out to st charles ,  with our friends the d ' s to try hendricks bbq .   we found a warm bustling place with a nice saturday night feel and some decent barbecue .   hendricks offers most meat choices that you would expect ;  both st louis style and back ribs ,  pulled pork ,  brisket ,  turkey and sausage (what no goat ?  oh well . )  hendricks has a seriously large menu ,  obviously centered around barbecue ,  but the weirdo in your party could find something else to eat .   we had a great waiter ,  aaron .   he was well informed ( i was impressed that he actually knew the definition of st louis style spare ribs) and when we each ordered a pick 2 platter ,  he informed us that each couple could split the whole shebang for the same price and actually get to sample all six meats for the same price ,  so that is what we did .   apparently it is a default to serve the meat without sauce ,  which  \" meats \"  with my approval .   there are four sauces on the table .   each of these trays of meat comes with four sides ;  so ms t and i had two slaws ,  greens and sweet potato fries .   the d ' s added cheddar grits ,  sweet potato casserole ,  green beans and baked beans .   so here we go from first to worst .   hendricks makes good ribs .   both the st louis style and the back ribs were smoky ,  moist ,  tender and nicely seasoned with rub .   the rub is the same on all meats and has a slight sweetness .   if it were over - applied ,  it would be too sweet ,  but it was in the proper proportion .   i would order these ribs any time and to me there is really no significant reason to choose one over the other .   next for me was the pulled pork .   i am not a fan of pulled pork in missouri .   often it is in large hunks and dry .   this was pulled to bite size and was moist ,  but not wet .   i would recommend this for a sandwich and it would be my second choice after the ribs .   the brisket was surprisingly good for this neck of the woods .   it had a good balance of smoke bark and beefy flavor .   it was nice and tender ,  but was on the edge of dry .   this would also make a good sandwich ,  but might require some mayo to lube it up .   i know this can vary a lot from brisket to brisket .   this is also worth ordering but at least this one night ,  was not quite as good as pm in chesterfield  valley .   still pretty good for missouri .   turkey breast and sausage bring up the rear and i would not re - order them .   turkey is always a real gamble .   if it is not overdone and you get to eat it as it is sliced ,  before any juices run out ,  it can be magnificent ,  as we experienced at black ' s barbecue in texas .   this had pretty mild smoke and was fairly dry .   it was not sawdust though and you could make a sandwich with plenty of mayo that would be credible .   i just would not order it again ,  though on another night it might be fine .     the sausage was ,  hmmmm .   i almost liked it .   it was not like hillshire farms (a point in its favor) .   it had some nice heat ,  ms t and the d ' s found it too spicy but it is not really .   i like the locally made jalapeno and plain sausages in texas .   they can be sensational .   my issue with this was that it tasted like pine sol .   this is either carelessness at the butcher shop with disinfectant or it has a spice in it resulting in that flavor .   is it juniper berries ?   a - 1 steak sauce kind of has the pine sol thing going ,  maybe they are basting it with that or it is in the mix .   whatever ,  all i can think of is  \" the power of pine sol ,  baby \"  when eating it .   i ' ll pass on that next time .   sides  -  ms d declared the green beans to be just a little better than plain out of the can .   (try some at alcenia ' s in memphis) they loved the sweet potato casserole ,  likening it to dessert .   they liked the cheesy grits and the baked beans .   i did not sample them .   aaron warned me off the baked beans due to onion .     the only think aaron was not accurate on was the slaw .   he thought it had no onion ,  but that was all i could taste .   this is very finely ground (not shredded) slaw in the style that you get on dogs and burgers in carolina .   it is unique ,  but inedible .   this was one of those rare times when we left the slaw .   it is unspeakably bad .   the sweet potato fries were fine .   the collard greens with bacon were good .   they were cooked well enough and seasoned with meat .   i enjoyed them .   there are even more sides to try .   hendricks was worth the drive on a winter night .   i think we need to meet our st charles friends ,  the l ' s there .   so go ,  have some ribs ,  maybe a pulled pork and brisket sandwich .   you will want to bring your own slaw .   i ' m going to be generous and go four stars on the strength of the ribs .

(or ,  maybe i ' m just developing a resistance to the bitterness that i remember from college ?  ?  ? ) .  anyway ,  it went down mighty easily ,  and over the years ,  i ' ve learned the hard way that drinking too many of them will instill upon you in the next day some of the worst feelings known to man .   awh ,  heck .  .  . as they say  \" victory comes at a price \"  :)  so there i was ,  thinking that we would be the only idiots eating dinner that late ,  but .  .  . this is west chester ,  on a saturday night .  .  . (i was wrong) !  the place was crowded and loud ,  but nothing that would draw you away .    a very nice waitress seated us in the back at a large round table ,  and we had drinks & menus in no time at all .   these people were working towards the end of what was likely a very long & hectic shift ,  but they still managed to seem like they were enjoying being there .  very polite ,  and easy smiles .  as i ' ve learned from sisters & friends once in that line of work .  .  .  . being fake is what waitress do very well !      anyway ,  there are good reasons this place was so busy .  the menu is large ,  the atmosphere was pleasant ,  the food was delicious ,  and i ' ll definitely go back there again .  .  . maybe on a weeknight that ' s hopefully less crowded .   not too pricey either ,  considering where & what it is .   two thumbs up !

' s review that says that allegro is a better quality product than frost .  if you compare the gelato here to the same flavor at allegro ,  it will lose .  but frost ' s strength is the variety  -  many more flavors than allegro .  and the gelato here is still quite good  -  a solid 4 stars .  but i wouldn ' t take an italian here looking for authentic stracciatella gelato .    frost also benefits from its location  -  next door to two very popular restaurants  -  sauce pizza and wine ,  and wildflower .  it ' s a great spot for some light dessert after a meal .

    "text": "i came to philly for a weekend trip with my bf ,  and remembered how great marrakesh was from years ago with my parents .   it ' s still down a dark alley off of south street and in a house (the owners '  house) things have slightly changed -  marrakesh is still dim ,  and served as a 5 - course eat - with - your - hands dinner family style ,  (as if in morocco)  surrounded by tons of middle eastern decor -  runs ,  lamps ,  the works .  the servers are the owners -  a couple who loves to keep it traditional .    i called ahead for seating at 8pm but it seems as though we could have just walked in -  we ate upstairs .   you have to ring the bell to get in .  we came on sunday but it was relatively busy -  downstairs was full but upstairs not so much .  maybe it was because we were upstairs .  .  . but i felt service lacked a bit (we had to ask for water a few times ,  etc but i couldn ' t hold it against the one server -  the wife) .  on fri and sat ,  there are belly dancers .    if you ' re new to this kind of thing ,  they do a good job explaining the process .  first ,  they ran your hands through soapy water from their majestic - looking teapot .  next ,  they explain the menu and ask you to choose between 1 or 2 course for dishes 3 and 4 .  you don ' t have a lot of flexibility .  .  so i am not sure how vegetarians would fare .    we ate:  1) course 1 -  three salads: picked carrots ,  cucumbers and an eggplant puree -  like a babaganoush .  this was very tender ,  salty and good -  the others were not as fancy but very tasty .  a large tangine looking thing comes around for you to grab pita .  the pita is ok -  it ' s not warm ,  it ' s not fluffy but you can ' t win them all (and it ' s important not to fill up too much on this)  2) course 2 -  very interesting kind of moroccan .  .  . quiche ?  it ' s basically a flaky pastry topped with confectioner ' s sugar that houses egg ,  chicken ,  nuts .  .  . and some other things .  it was overwhelmingly eggy ,  but tasty .  not my favorite dish but had to give it points for creativity and uniqueness .   the flaky dough was delish -  very similar to that of the green spinach pie .   3) course 3 -  was our choice between two chicken (chicken with lemon olive oil or spicy cumin) -  of course we did spicy cumin !  it was fall right off the bone -  so tender as i ' m sure it was slow cooked for hours .  it ' s also half a chicken so you get the breast ,  thigh and wing .  the sauce was not too spicy ,  i thought ,  but the cumin flavor is smoky and present .  the sauce is pretty slathered across the meat -  and yes you can refill up on pita if you ' re not into eating meat solo .    4) course 4 -  is a choice between beef or lamb and since i don ' t do red meat ,  i passed on this .  my bf ordered the lamb though and said it was very tender and yummy -  and sweet .  it was topped with almonds and something else that made it sweet .    5) course 5 -  dessert !   you get fresh fruit and baklava (one piece each) .  usually i think baklava is too sweet for me but this one was pretty good -  and not too oily .  i mean ,  yes ,  it was very oily but it wasn ' t like .  .  . drenched in oil .  it was pretty flat ,  cripsy and full of that nutty goodness that you make baklava .  bf said it wasn ' t nutty enough for him .  again ,  the flaky dough wins .    the fresh fruit was also a plus -  except our apple was bruised so we didn ' t eat that .  we took our orange for breakfast the next day .  there were two strawberries (not really regional ,  ha) and giant seedless grapes that were almost frozen because it the fruit platter came with a chunk of ice .  this was almost like a cornucopia .  . they really do make you feel like emperor and empress haha !   the meal is well paced (slow) so you have time to breathe .   they sell only a few house wines by the glass ;  otherwise you get it by the bottle (there are a few varieties at $30 ish ,  as well as liquor and the like) .  my bf got two glasses of red wine -  the burgandy .  it was actually fruity and full of body ,  which was a plus .  i ordered the traditional rose drink which i actually wouldn ' t recommend -  it was really ,  really sweet .  it was like rose syrup (sweet enough) ,  with sugar and water .  . it was too sweet and at $5 ,  i was upset i couldn ' t finish it .    this place accepts cash only and is $25 per person .  i feel the menu could get old since you don ' t have variety but it ' s definitely a must - try while in philly .

    "text": "went here for lunch on a friday .  i got the fried chicken tenders (hot) with the collard greens and macaroni and cheese .  all three were really good !  it was more than enough for a meal but could have been split in two .  the chicken was juicy and well cooked ,  but if you like spicy food you will need to add more hot sauce .  the sides were also well made .  i was interested in trying the bourbon whipped sweet potato but i ' m glad i didn ' t .  a friend had ordered it but didn ' t finish it because she said it wasn ' t good .  i tried a bit of it and completely agreed .  idk if it was the bourbon or lack of seasoning but it just was not good .  i usually will make plain sweet potatoes at home ,  boiled or baked ,  with a little salt and pepper and they have more flavor then this dish had .  other than that ,  what i enjoyed my meal .  i would be interested in trying other options .  it was great for a quick lunch ,  even with a long line we ordered and got our food pretty quickly .  the staff was also really friendly .

    "text": "crisp vegetables spring rolls and a sweet savoury pad thai with well executed noodles .  good predictable thai meal .   because i learned they allow byob ,  i brought over some beers from the giant in the same shopping strip .   i ordered the vegetable spring rolls and shrimp pad thai .   the spring rolls come out hot out of the fryer .  they are sliced at an angle ,  which allows more of the aroma of the filling to waft up to one ' s nose .   the crust was pleasantly golden ,  both slightly oily and crisp .  the interior of the roll was slightly mushy (not quite perfect . ) but the mix of vegetables was savoury and generous in portion .   the accompanying sweet and sour dipping sauce added a needed element of acid to an otherwise very umami forward flavor profile .   the shrimp pad thai was portioned very generously .  the noodles were well executed ,  firm yet soft on the bite .  the dish had a powerful flavor blend of fishiness ,  savouriness ,  and sweet .  the nuts inside were just crunchy enough to add an interesting mouthfeel .    the shrimp was slightly over cooked and presented a noticeable but subtle mushiness .    overall the dish was filling and more interesting in flavor than in texture ,  which was quite homogeneous .  the noodles really did an excellent job absorbing the pad thai sauce .

    "text": "loved penang during my time in boston ,  so i was excited to see one in philly ' s chinatown !  quality of the food was about the same too .  the menu is fairly diverse ,  and offers a variety of thai ,  malaysian ,  indian and chinese dishes .    definitely try the roti canai ,  probably the most ordered item in the restaurant .  you get a huge blanket of roti ,  wrapped artfully into a sculpture .  it is only a couple millimeters thick and strikes a perfect balance between crispiness and chewiness .  it goes great with the accompanying curry sauce ,  which also contains some pieces of chicken and potato .    i also tried out the indian mee goreng on my most recent visit .  it certainly had a lot of taste and went well with the other dishes i ordered ,  but a warning that there is a strong seafood taste (they use dried squid sauce) .   another favorite of mine is the beef rendang .  the beef is super tender and the curry sauce it is cooked in is delicious  -  tastes of coconut milk and lemongrass ,  with hints of cinnamon .  order a bowl or two of rice to go with this !   finally ,  i would order the spareribs malaysian style .  these pork shortribs are lightly fried ,  but the meat is juicy and goes really well with the accompanying sweet and sour sauce !    service overall is quite good and the food comes out at a reasonable pace .  this place does get crowded though !

    "text": "tried olly fresco ' s for the first time today .  it ' s located on 107 street ,  in the alberta health services seventh street plaza ,  ground floor of the south tower .  it ' s kind of like sunterra in that it ' s mostly self serve ,  though there is a soup (4 different kinds) and sandwich/panini/breakfast counter at the back .  lots of choices for drinks (water ,  soda ,  kombucha ,  etc) ,  snacks (like individually wrapped cheese ,  $0 . 85 a piece) and desserts (cookies ,  candies) .  a decent - sized salad bar with a variety of leafy greens (all looking fresh) and lots of toppings (chicken breast ,  deli meat ,  other vegetables) .  the hot food self - serve area also has about 10 choices ($1 . 89/100g)  -  several meats (today was roast beef au jus ,  roast chicken legs with mashed potatoes and gravy on the side ,  butter chicken ,  and another indian dish) ,  a fish (i think it was breaded) ,  perogies (with self serve bacon and sour cream .  .  .  dangerous) ,  and some veggies (steamed broccoli and cauliflower ,  roasted potato wedges) ,  and i assume there is always a vegetarian dish  -  today ' s was lasagna .  i may have forgotten about a few other dishes .  everything is labelled and relatively fresh  -  i saw them replenishing lots of dishes even before it got down to the very end undesirable bits .    i enjoyed the mishmash i picked up .  you use take out styrofoam containers so you can always bring home leftovers .  the lasagna was cheesy and flavourful ,  despite not having any meat in it .  the noodles were not as al dente as i would have liked and it was a touch salty ,  but overall i liked it .  the broccoli was perfectly steamed to retain nutrients  -  still bright green and just a touch of crunch .  the roast chicken was really popular  -  i don ' t know if it was legs only but i snagged the last piece of thigh in a sea of drumsticks  -  skin was still kind of crispy and seasoned with some herbs (indistinguishable though) .  a touch dry but totally edible still .  i loved the perogies  -  they were very generic potato ones ,  nothing special but not bad (e . g .  ,  the right amount of dough and filling ,  not mushy) .  i loved being able to choose as much sour cream and bacon bits (real ones ! ) as i wanted .    there ' s quite a bit of seating and a lot of people seem to get the food to go ,  so i didn ' t have any trouble finding a spot for two around 12:15pm (it was busy though ! ) .  after grabbing a bottle of premium water ,  my total came to about $13 ,  and i was certainly quite full .  you can spend as much or as little as you want to .  i thought the food was decent despite it being made for the masses ,  and i love the variety of choices  -  i understand that they change offerings daily so i ' d be interested to try other options .  i think it ' s a really great option for the people who work on this west end of downtown (note it ' s closed on weekends) .  i will be back !

    "text": "i surprised my girl with dinner at bailey ' s range ,  and she was excited to go !   being a burger aficionado ,  i was happy to indulge my girl ' s burger passion .   at the same time ,  we were excited because the range makes everything from scratch  -  -  and i mean everything ,  right down to homemade buns and homemade sauces .   if they made their own glassware ,  plates ,  and silverware ,  i think they would have taken the experience to a whole new level !     we got there shortly after the range opened ,  so seating was not a problem .   our server took our drink orders .   she had a dark beer ,  and i had the  \" sweet sweet bacon \"   -  -  a milkshake with maker ' s mark ,  candied bacon ,  and salted caramel ice cream .   the shake was good  -  -  i think mine might have had a little too much maker ' s mark ,  knocking the balance of the drink off ,  but i didn ' t mind  -  -  it had been a long week up to thursday .  .  .  !   we skipped appetizers and went right to mains .   she ordered the american burger ,  and was more than happy .   then again ,  who wouldn ' t want a fried mac ' n cheese patty atop their burger ,  which was cooked medium rare (appropriately the way she wanted it) on a soft bun (double score for her ! ) .   i ordered the ahh jamn !  ,  which was supposed to come with bacon jam ,  red onions (i had asked for caramelized onions) ,  mushrooms ,  and cheddar cheese .   when my burger came out ,  i was ready to kill it ,  so started enjoying it .   about midway through the experience ,  it dawned on me  -  -   \"  .  .  . is this my burger ?  \"   i didn ' t really get the taste of bacon jam or mushrooms ,  though it looked like it might have been on there .   the cheese enveloped my burger ,  so it was hard to tell whether i had the right burger .   but i pressed on anyway ,  because i was hungry .   we also ordered a large order of fries ,  and asked for their house mayo and house cheese sauce .   the fries were great ,  and the homemade sauces were divine .   overall ,  this was a good experience .   in hindsight ,  i should have said something to our server regarding my burger ,  but i chose not to .   that was my bad .   that ' s the only reason why i give bailey ' s 4/5 stars rather than 5/5 stars .   that being said ,  that only means that i ' ll be back there again to try something different ,  because bailey ' s range is worth it !

    "text": "ooppps ,  didn ' t finish my review .  .  .  went to the gaylord opryland resort while we were in nashville .  did not stay there but came to visit the grounds and take the tour of the resort .  after looking at the rates for the evening ,  the rates were very similar to those where we were staying .  that does not mean you would get one of the rooms with the balcony overlooking the waterfalls ,  river and beautiful gardens .  if you got one of those rooms for the price that was being advertised ,  it would be a great deal .    first off ,  we parked in the parking lot next to the hotel .  at a rate of $38 + tax [about $42 total] it was pretty expensive .  we got to park right up against the hotel then realized that there is a free parking lot with a shuttle ;  ouch !  the resort is completely enclosed so it is always 68 to 72 degrees inside .  we took the river boat tour that is very informative and a nice couple of minutes to take a tour around the resort .  its about $12 and though we had to wait about an hour for it to be repaired ,  it allowed us to go to the island for a little shopping .  by  \" us \"  ,  of course i mean my wife and daughter .    a very neat fact is that they sent empty bottles all over the world and asked them to send it back with local water .   bottles came back from europe ,  africa ,  south american and other .  i hope there was no disease in the nile waters ,  uh no .  so they take all the bottles and pour it into this man made river in a special ceremony .  who knows ,  there could be water from chapala ,  guadalajara ;  my dad ' s  home town .  again ,  uh no .   the riverboat was fun and the very knowledgeable tour guide gave us some great info .  we went to see some of the shops and unfortunately some of the shops were not open ,  such as the ice cream shop or cafe in the middle of the resort .    if we would have known about the free parking ,  this would have been a very inexpensive outing and a nice get away from the summer heat .  i still think it was a great time to visit and enjoy the environment .

    "text": "i heard quiet a few things about this place from people all around .  i noticed that they opened one up by where i live .  so i decided to check out ,  \" five guys burgers and fries \"  .  yes i know there is a typo ,  and no i am not the one who posted the business listing .  {edit} -  looks like they fixed the typo ,  i guess no yummy french feies for me  ; )  when i got there they had a long line out the door .  the thought that kept racing through my head was that the food better be worth the wait .  as i inched my way to the counter which took about 25 minutes . i finally got to the cashier .  she was very friendly and explanatory about the menu .  she gave me suggestions to order .  so i picked what i wanted and placed my order .   i ordered the bacon cheese burger with cajun fries .  they give you multiple options of what you want on your burger .  the toppings i chose were grilled onions , grilled mushrooms ,  lettuce ,  tomato and mayo .  the burger was fantastic !  i also tried the cajun fries they were good also !  still the thoughts of that meal dance through my head .  they sell hot dogs at five guys ,  so i might keep that as an option . also for vegetarians out there they do sell grilled cheese sandwiches and a veggie burger .    one thing that i will note is that the fries are cooked in peanut oil .  also they have free peanuts available for customers .  if you have any allergies to peanuts than this place is probably not for you .  i just thought i would throw in that disclaimer .  another heads up is how busy this place gets .  you may have to take your meal to go given the fact that indoor and outdoor seating may be occupied .  the prices are pretty reasonable here because you can get a filling meal for under $10 .    it still boggles my mind that this place is fast food ,  because it is almost as good as most gourmet burger spots .  i will admit that for a chain fast food restaurant this place is top shelf .  this place is definitely worth checking out .   in short good food , good prices ,  and good service .  who could ask for anything more ?

    "text": "this is just some seriously authentic mexican food .   i found out about this place from my boss who was raving about the horchata .  they make it fresh .  it ' s the kind of horchata that you have to keep stirring to keep it together .  definitely the best i ' ve ever had .   the tacos are so well made .  the meat is very tender and all the pickled veggies with fresh corn tortillas make for a wonderful ,  tasty combination .   you basically feel as though you are in mexico here .  from the outside to the inside it is very authentic .  i didn ' t try the pico but it seems very unique .

    "text": "took the whole fam jam ,  including gramma ,  out to wok house last night in st .  albert .   we ' ve been eagerly awaiting the opening this past week because their banner outside read:  chinese ,  dim sum ,  bubble tea !   yep ,  that ' s right  -  st .  albert now has dim sum and bubble tea !  !  !   the location is in the old banana leaf restaurant next door to simply donair in the same strip mall as dairy queen .   we were greeted by a friendly family who let us choose anywhere in the restaurant to sit  -  kiddos opted for the booth/bench option .   the decor was modern and clean .   the menu variety really surprised me and all dim sum is cooked to order rather than coming around on carts .    we decided we might as well go hard and try stuff from all parts of the menu .   first off ,  we ordered bubble teas:  fresh fruit mango dairy free with sago ,  fresh fruit peach dairy free with sago ,  and milky matcha green tea with sago .   all were excellent .   the waitress waited to see if i liked he matcha because she warned that it ' s not very sweet and said she could make it sweeter if i preferred but i ' m a matcha monster and this was exactly what i was looking for : - )    next up ,  they brought out a couple of small appetizers for us to share in celebration of their opening  -  spring roll ,  tempura shrimp ,  and a dry garlic rib:  all were excellent with my 7 year old requesting more of each !   we decided to share the dinner for 2 which came with spring rolls ,  chicken fried rice ,  2 bowls of soup (won ton and hot & sour were both decent) and 2 entree choices:  we selected honey pepper shrimp (divine) and sliced szechuan beef .    both of the mains were good and flavourful with a good amount of sauce .   everyone in our group noted that the use of onions was pretty heavy and more peppers ,  corn ,  carrots ,  etc .  would be nice .   i ' d say the dishes were at about 1/3 white onions  -  usually this is a deal breaker for me but the sauces and meat quality were superb .    next up was our never ending sampling of dim sum:  pork buns  -  $4 . 99 good but smaller than most ;  my daughter didn ' t care for them here  and neither did gramma (not sure why) .   sticky rice (excellent but it only comes with 2 small leaves for $4 . 99  -  this could be vastly improved by adding a 3rd one for that price or putting more rice in each banana leaf .   literally ,  the banana leaves had less than 1/2 of the amount of rice you would have at jumbo) .    beef skewers  -  not as pictured and not up to snuff in my opinion for $4 . 99 for 2 .   green onion cake  -  $4 . 99 a standard that my kids will insist on every visit though i prefer mine to be a little crunchier .   pan fried meat dumplings  -  $4 . 99 standard but they don ' t bring red wine vinegar or whatever that sauce is most dim sum places serve with it .   curried squid  -  $4 . 99 excellent and tender but i would love the sauce to be a bit thicker and more plentiful to pour all over my rice : - )  we ' d order 80% of the food again and to be able to have dim sum in st .  albert any day of the week at any time ,  we will most definitely be returning here .     even if mom and dad want regular chinese food ,  the kids in our house will jump for joy at sticky rice ,  green onion cakes ,  and bubble tea !   service was friendly but slow tonight with our dishes coming as much as 60 minutes apart  -  yikes !   but i won ' t fault them on this as they work out their bugs ,  hopefully in the future we will get things (like rice) before the rest of the meal .   cheers wok house ,  can ' t wait to come back !   p . s .  they deliver ,  too !

    "text": "pulling up to the burg you might think it ' s a weird spot for a diner -  it ' s a small strip mall with a barber and a real estate agent but it ' s worth the visit .    the owner bill is there just about every day -  he takes his time to greet and thank every table .   his mom is usually there to greet and fill your coffee .   they all ,  including the servers ,  try to always remember you and your favorites .   my personal favorite is the hungry greek .   my family and i typically all order the combo .  for around $10 you get 2 pancakes ,  2 eggs ,  2 meat of your choice ,  potato or grits and toast .  the pancakes are easily the best in st pete !  they have a sweetness to them ,  maybe vanilla ,  that just kicks them up a notch .    always check the chalkboards for their specials ,  they usually will have a fun pancake like strawberry cheesecake or peanut butter cup ,  as well as a skillet or breakfast burrito option .   if you go for lunch -  get the burger .   perfectly seasoned with fresh cut fries .

(the back room is quieter . )   -  -  bring christmas night ,  i have to say both the kitchen and service were a bit  \" off ,  \"  but only in terms of timing  -  -  not in terms of food (see below) .  certain things came out almost too quickly ;  other things seemed to take forever .  for example ,  l\u00fcke offered two types of oysters ,  and we ordered six of one ,  and a dozen of the other .  the order of six came in a relatively timely fashion ,  but the 12 seemingly took forever ,  arriving long after the (cooked) appetizers were finished ,  and just before the entr\u00e9es .  it also took a (relatively) long time to get the wine we ordered to accompany our entr\u00e9es .  this ,  however ,  is more appropriately chalked up to xmas night ,  rather than being  \" the norm \"  in our experience .   that said ,  the food was ,  as always ,  wonderful and delicious !  the rabbit & chicken liver pate was silky smooth and satisfying ;  the brussels sprouts crispy and tasty ;  the crabmeat maison flavorful and tangy .  the drum was perfect ,  as were the shrimp & grits and the moules frites .   l\u00fcke remains ,  for us ,  one of those places you can count on for good food and good drinks .  it may not be our favorite place in new orleans ,  but it always satisfies .  _______________ \u00b9 formerly the hotel new orleans ,  formerly the w downtown  -  -  i guess it depends upon what day of the week it is .

    "text": "this is my friendly ,  neighborhood coffee shop .  so i may be a little biased .  but there are definitely some pros and cons to share .  pros: the baristas are great (i can only think of 2 - 3 out of 25+ situations that weren ' t great) ,  energy is great (easy to feel comfortable whether you ' re getting some alone time or meeting with folks  -  -  indoor and outdoor community tables are fantastic) ,  the food and pastries are well - made (make sure you try the raspberry - ricotta scone  -  -  best ever) ,  great non - coffee beverage options (which can be rare ! ) .  cons: not too many outlets for laptop use (not a huge deal ,  but there have been a few times i ' ve come with business to do and had to leave) ,  the method they use to brew coffee can leave some hefty silt that makes coffee thick and sometimes bitter (we ' re splitting hairs now  -  -  just get the americano instead ,  it ' s great) ,  there have been a few times my food has taken a while ,  so it ' s good to set yourself (and others) up for success by not being in a rush .  honestly ,  a few minor things notwithstanding ,  i really love this place .  i love what they do for my neighborhood .  i couldn ' t be more grateful that i live a block away .

($2 a cup)  they have a zillion choices of creme brule '  ,  and rather large starter salads that are almost a meal in themselves .   we took our family here and were all around impressed .  only downfall was the slowness of service .  .  .  we were definitely salivating before the food came ,  and ate way too much bread .

(it was 110 degrees that day . ) decor is a mix of industrial and southwest .  .  . the staff was very friendly .  i was there when the college was out so the place was not crowed at all .  which is what i like .  i had the black n blue burger with the beer fires .  it was pretty decent and it came out very fast which was a plus .  i will be back when i am in town again .

(not to sound like a slob or someone that needs so much space ,  its just a super small area that would better suit one person rather than two and might use one less table to create just a little more breathing room) but the food was incredible .  we got the cheese fries with oxtail to split ,  and i got the fried chicken sandwich .  mouth - watering good .  we also got the salted caramel bacon cream puffs for dessert and they were so good !  it ' s a bit more expensive than what we usually opt for ,  but for a once in a while treat ,  it ' s definitely a place we ' ll go back to .  highly recommended !  !

    "text": "yeah !  congrats la mulita !  what better day to give this new restaurant a whirl than cinco de mayo with $5 salt rimmed margaritas ?    first off ,  the margarita was mighty tasty .  the second one was equally delicious  ; ) i ' m not typically a marg fan but in the spirit of the day i opted for not one but two .  in general ,  la mulita ' s cocktail menu is very wallet - friendly with most drinks falling in the $6 to $7 price range .  also ,  i appreciated that they had new local breweries like outliers on the menu .   before i move on to the eats ,  i have to mention how cozy and sexy the space is  -  from the low lighting to the industrial vibe with wood timber ,  exposed beams ,  etc .  (see picture) the lighting found that perfect spot between too bright and fluorescent and uber dark (ya know .  .  . we ' re trying super hard to feel like a speakeasy/you can hardly see your date) .  nicely done .    eats:   - my personal favorite was the refreshing columbian coleslaw  -  i appreciated that it wasn ' t heavy and left me feeling less guilty about the half dozen other eats i sampled during our visit .    - delicious guac  -  i knew this going in but i would also like to add that the chips were tasty to boot .     - salsa and chips  -  nothing mind blowing but i would definitely order again   - kale chips  -  i hate to buy these when out because i can make them pretty well at home but i couldn ' t resist trying my neighbors  -   -  soooo good !  plus ,  it ' s a great healthier bar bite option .    - roasted red cabbage and sundried tomato pesto dip: we probably should have stopped ordering more food before this because by the time it rolled around i needed to unbutton my pants .  my dining companions couldn ' t believe that there wasn ' t any meat in this app ,  it somehow pulled off a hearty taste with all veggies .     - lastly ,  vegetarian chiliquales: on the dry side .  unfortunately ,  i couldn ' t taste the pepper .  i ' m thinking if there were a few more veggies and more  \" sauce \"  this dish would be top notch .    can ' t wait for my next visit !

(i didn ' t enjoy it as immensely as my husband enjoyed his meal ,  but no complaints . )   their salsa is great ,  but unfortunately we weren ' t wowed by the tableside guac .  which made me a little sad because i love me some tableside guac ,  but it was okay .  we got the medium spicyness so maybe we should have gotten the spicy and might have enjoyed it more .  no matter ,  it didn ' t take much away from the evening .  my sangria was top notch and after our meal they even brought me out a slice of tres leches cake (my favorite !  how did they know ?  ! ) with a little candle in it .  my husband didn ' t tell them it was my birthday so they must actually read the comments you put when you do an online reservation since i wrote that it was my birthday dinner .  i thought that was very nice of them to do so .   thanks besito !  we will definitely be back !  although ,  probably only for special occasions because it is a bit pricey .  (our total for both our entrees ,  tableside guac ,  a dos equis amber ,  one glass of sangria and tip was a little over $80 . )",

    "text": "this is a great little byo on sansom ,  right down the street from melograno .   not sure how i ' ve never been there ,  but armed with a bottle of white ,  stopped in for a thursday night dinner .   we shared the octopus and calamari and appetizer which wasn ' t the best i ' ve ever had ,  but it was cooked properly .   bread with olive oil and ricotta was nice ,  but would be better if they warmed the bread .   i had the eggplant appetizer with a side of fettuccine for my entree .   it was really good ,  although their tomato sauce is a little on the salty side for my taste .   the eggplant was cooked really nicely though ,  and i ate the whole thing .     service was great .   our waitress was very attentive and everyone there was very friendly .   they must have a large room upstairs because there was a birthday party for 30 people up there .   the main dining area is tiny .

'  thing where we think we ' ll get two different things and then try each others .  i got shrimp ,  he got chicken and our buddy got pulled pork .  i asked my boyfriend if he wanted a bite of mine and he sort of pulled back and said  ' no ,  i mean ,  obviously we ' re going to be coming back ,  so we can just try a different type next time '  .   dude loved his chicken taco .  and i loved my shrimp taco !  i hear the pulled pork tacos were also pretty magnificent .  the chips and guacamole were delicious ,  but for the price i would like a little more guacamole .  the spicy rim margarita really hit the spot and was a great accompaniment to the tacos and ,  at $5 . 50 ,  i think they were reasonably priced .  (i had 5) but what i don ' t like to see with any margarita is a bartender pulling out a jigger and measuring precisely two jiggers of booze .  for that ,  you get four stars ,  revolucion .  live a little !  get me greased up ,  liquored up ,  super slick and oil my gears !   the fried potatoes were pretty  ' meh '  ,  but the  ' pink death '  hot sauce was killer .  i think it removed a layer of my tongue while still managing to be flavorful ,  so that was pretty stellar .  so now in a rocky dennis fashion ,  i will break down for you the  ' things that i love '   things that i loved: (the sun on my face)   - affordability  - deliciousness  - freshness  - an atmosphere where you go ,  eat your taco and then sit around for a few hours drinkng because it ' s just a chill place to be .   things that i didn ' t love: (the sun on my face)   - not being a bit loose with the tequila  - mediocre taters having to wait in line every time i wanted to order another margarita .  like i said ,  i drank 5 and a daquiri .  every additional margarita meant me waiting in line to order it .  that ' s not so awesome .    - they would not make a mojito !  get out of here with that !   but we will definitely be frquenting !

( there was some confusion about this) .    the only disappointment i had was the dessert .  we were between the nutella cake versus the tres leches ,  and was convinced by the waiter to go for the flourless ,  gluten free nutella cake .  this was a mistake -  hard ,  gritty ,  and low on flavor .  what a disappointing way to end the meal !    i will be back to try other menu items ,  and have already recommended this place to others .

    "text": "i have been trying to come here for what seems like an eternity ,  but there was always something in the way .   (like the one day when i was  \" finally going to eat there \"  and as we walked up there was a sign on the door stating that because of malfunctions in the kitchen ,  they were only serving drinks and cold food .   needless to say ,  i didn ' t go in that day)  finally ,  the stars aligned and i was able to eat here .   and i ' m happy i did .   i went in with two friends after getting our nails done and sat at a table .   we ordered drinks ,  truffled cauliflower ,  and an order of tater tots .   they put the tater tots closest to me and i can ' t control myself ,  so no one else at the table got tater tots .   they were really good .   i ordered the burger without the thousand island dressing and with cheddar and caramelized onions .   that was a goooooooooood burger .   cooked perfectly ,  juicy ,  and the roll was soft and pillowy .   it didn ' t last long on my plate .   we got an order of duck fat french fries for the table and while they were good ,  i think i liked the tater tots better and would probably order them as our side next time .    my only issue with village whiskey is the space .   it ' s so small .   they crammed the three of us into a space that really was built for two people .   after we left ,  each one of us realized that our legs were cramped and sore from trying to squeeze into that tight spot .   maybe next time ,  and there will be a next time ,  i might consider asking for a bigger table .    (do they even have bigger tables ?  i was so enamored with my food ,  i didn ' t look around too much)",

    "text": "best burger i had so far in nashville ,  much better than the highly acclaimed the pharmacy .    the burger is juicy and flavorful .  the benton bacon goes so well with the burger than regular bacon .  it is crispy and when you bite down the burger ,  you don ' t have to use your finger to break the bacon nor eat the entire piece .  so definitely recommend you try benton bacon !   the chili chili bang bang is excellent ,  especially the chipotle aioli jalape\u00f1o gives a bit kick .    the burger buns are good ,  not the super chewy kind the pharmacy has for its burger .  well ,  unless you like chewy buns for your burger .
