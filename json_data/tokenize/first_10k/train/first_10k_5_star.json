    "text": "great mexican byob !  i went to las cazuelas for the first time for my birthday .   we had a wonderful time .   i was looking for a fun and festive place to go with friends .   this was the perfect choice .  we brought our own bottle of tequila ,  and they made tasty margaritas for the table .   those were a big hit with my friends ,  and a cool twist for a mexican byob .   the restaurant is cute .   plus ,  the food here is delicious .    i ' m surprised this place doesn ' t have higher reviews on yelp ,  because it far exceeded my expectations .  .  .    the guacamole appetizer was fresh and yummy .   i ordered the shrimp entree with rice and vegetables ,  and asked for it spicy .   my entr\u00e9e had an attractive presentation on the plate  ( i . e .  looked classy )  ,  and was delicious ,  well seasoned ,  and very fresh .  on my suggestion ,  my partner ordered one of their mole sauce dishes  ( i . e .  a sauce usually made from unsweetened chocolate and pureed pumpkin seeds )  ,  and it was tasty too .    i should also note that the waitress was very attentive .   when i placed my order ,  i explained to her that i have mild lactose intolerance and can ' t eat much butter or cream  ( but am okay with cheese )  ,  so she had the chef cook the veggies in olive oil ,  rather than butter .   thanks for being so cool about accommodating that request !     the prices are extremely reasonable for fancy and unusual mexican food ,  and i love the fact they ' re a byob .   the chef serves creative and inspired cuisine ,  which has a traditional flair and style to it .   in other words :  don ' t come here for regular tacos or burritos .   come here for a fun foodie experience at a reasonable price ,  and bring tequila for the perk of byob margaritas !

    "text": "truly a hidden gem .  fantastic ,  charming service ,  nice cozy atmosphere with unique and delicious home cooked food .  lots of vegetarian dishes ,  but we went in another direction .  we started with an ashak appetizer ,  an incredible lightly steamed dumpling covered with a meat ,  yogurt sauce .   also tried the bulani appetizer .  it was a crunchy fried potato and onion pastry with a yogurt dip .  it ' s a byob ,  so we brought a decent bottle of champagne and saved a lot on the bill .  i ordered the qablee palaw which was tender marinated lamb with almonds ,  raisins ,  carrots ,  and rice .  my wife had the lamb kabob ,  grilled ,  smoky and very tender .  we finished the meal with afghan style ice cream ,  and baklava with two strong coffees .  perhaps the best and most affordable meal we ' ve had in town in the last several years .

    "text": "i have to say that i was really impressed with this place .  i had heard about it here on yelp and decided i should try it .  i ordered the ranch fried chicken and the indian cinnamon donut and both were very good .  i also had what i would call their plain donut and it was delicious .  the donuts were moist and warm and extremely tasty and were probably the best i have ever had .  the chicken was tender and moist and also delicious .  the only downside to this place is the size .  the restaurant is very small and there is very little seating .  the seating is diner style ,  stools at a counter .  this would be a great place for takeout ,  which they do .   overall i would definitely recommend going here .  i would also recommend going early as they tend to sell out fairly quickly in the mornings .

    "text": "as avid brewery connoisseurs and current nashville locals ,  we were extremely and pleasantly surprised with our experience at tennessee brew works this evening .    it was a dreary ,  rainy night and as we pulled up we were fairly apprehensive about the string of dark warehouses and quiet alleys .  it all changed quickly as we walked into the  \" tennessee fill station \"   ( or some name similar )  portion of the building .  the fellas working there directed us to the  \" tennessee tap room \"   ( or some name similar )  portion of the building that overlooked 2 stories into the  \" tennessee brew works \"   ( or some name similar )  portion of the building where the brewing takes place .  i ' ve added the specifics because this is the first group audacious and clever enough to pull off all three portions under one roof .  .  .  .  and to still comply with tennessee ' s archaic liquor laws !  if sticking it to the man isn ' t enough reason for you to check it out .  .  .  .  keep reading .    the tap room is super neat and cleverly laid out with patios ,  long  &  community - oriented tables ,  a flying bridge or  \" catwalk \"  and a steady stream of live ,  local music .  it ' s largely non - smoking  ( which is enough to convince me to cross the bridge from east nashville )  and has a few tvs to cater to the football crowds .    biggest fortes :    -  the staff is amazing .  the smiles and enthusiasm when they start talking about their beer are a sweet relief .  they ' re excited !  they ' re adventurous !  they aren ' t pretentious .  real people .   -  the beers are fresh  &  different .  they keep it local .  they aren ' t afraid to venture from the norm .  they add their own zing and flair .  .  .  .  and for that ,  i respect them .   -  they appreciate the food  &  beer pairing concept .  they ' re bringing in great food to compliment their brews .  it ' s a movement .   if you ' ve managed to read all of that rambling -  you can ignore any other reviews and just go ahead and get there .

( i think the police officer is there because of the amount of customers in there at one time )  .  let ' s just start with the donuts .  they r amazing .  they have the best donuts around .  i love donuts so i have been to just about every donut shop in the nola area .  and these r the best !  !  !   the donuts are usually hot and they can usually make any special order u want .  all u have to do is ask .  whenever i want special orders i call early in the morning and they can usually have it done by noon .  the apple fritters here are so good as well !  !  !   red velvet cake and reese peanut butter are my favorites oh wait the oreo donut is just as good !   next let ' s move on to kastleburgers .  .  .  these kastleburgers are a new orleans original and no one can top them .  these people have to entire process of cooking kastleburgers down to a science .   (  or so it appears )  .  i have seen the crystal across the street but any one that is local knows tastee ' s kastleburgers are so much better .  does anyone even go to crystal ?   also just like the donuts you can special order the kastleburgers .  they are always made  fresh .  the breakfast is so good as well .  they use real products .  it is defiantly made to order and not typical fast food breakfast .  u can order anything u can imagine for breakfast .  i have seen people eating hot sausage egg and cheese sandwiches and i have seen all different types of breakfast platters served .  they also have a huge selections of po boys and sandwiches that u can order 24 / 7 .  now the hot plates they serve here are so good .  they have everything and it ' s all home cooked u can taste it .  it reminds me of when i was little and my grandma fixed me red beans and rice .  they also have this pasta defiantly homemade it is so good it has crawfish and shrimp in it .   the gumbo is good as well .  all i can say is pass up all other donut shops and come her for the full new orleans style donut experience .  this is an old time genuinely good donut shop the donuts taste the same as they did when i was a child it ' s so nice to have a restaurant /  donut shop that doesnt take the easy way out cut corners and produce a not so good product .  this place is the best donut shop around .

    "text": "well ,  i hope i don ' t offend the bbq police with this review .  .  .  . but i didn ' t order any bbq here .  .  .  . what i did order was ,  possibly ,  the best hot chicken sandwich i have ever had .  .  .  . no small feat in a town that dominates the world of hot chicken .   i was convinced to try out edley ' s when a friend in town billed it as  ' unique and gourmet bbq '  .  .  .  . ok ,  i ' m not sure exactly what that means ,  but what the hell ,  i ' ll give it a whirl !   i like good bbq ,  but i love good nashville hot chicken ,  and that just jumped out at me on the menu .   so ,  i throw in my order for a hot chicken sandwich .  .  .  . i was mildly alarmed when i was told that it only came in one level of hotness and they couldn ' t give me any hot sauce on the side  ( they did offer wing sauce )  .   despite some mild reservations upon this discovery  ( what kind of real hot chicken place doesn ' t offer some type of  ' this will kill you from the inside out '  level of spice ?  )  ,  i pushed ahead with the order .   damn ,  i am a brave man .   we sit down and the order comes out just a few minutes later .   here we go .  .  . after de - pickling it ,  i dig in .   first thing i notice is the breading :  not as thick as your  ' standard '  hot chicken ,  but full of flavor .   i actually liked it better .  .  .  . seems lighter  ( but i know it ' s not more healthy ,  i ' m not kidding myself on that )  .   the chicken was really tender and cooked perfectly .   the spice what a little on the light side ,  but still had enough heat for you to know it was there .     anyway ,  i am a huge fan of this place .  .  .  . great food ,  full bar ,  nice set up inside ,  and a great patio as well .   throw a great location on top of that ,  and what else could you ask for ?

    "text": "trident never disappoints for me .   it ' s going to largely be bar cuisine but i find it quite delightful .   i go here not when i ' m in the mood for something healthy  ( though the paleo bowl would fulfill that if  you are looking for something healthy )  i go here when i went delicious bar food .   if you like regular nachos ,  the kind with real melted cheese  ( not fake cheese sauce )  ,  these are some of the best you can get .   they ' re nothing crazy ,  no unique twist ,  just damn good nachos .   if you want fancier nachos ,  try elsewhere .   but here is going to be one of your best options for straight up regular delicious nachos .   the half portion is more than sufficient for one person .   i cannot even imagine trying to tackle the full portion .  i ' m a vegetarian so i never get it with beef ,  but you can totally add a meat option should you wish .   also delicious is their mac and cheese .   it ' s so cheesy ,  never dried out ,  and always has some nice cheese melted right on top .   you can get it as a side with many of their burgers ,  or you can order the entr\u00e9e sized .   and in my opinion ,  you can never go wrong by adding green chiles to the mac and cheese .   because green chilis are a gift .   i love their caprese appetizer as well .   standard mozzarella ,  tomato ,  basil ,  balsamic .   but it ' s always tasty .   same with the mozzarella sticks .   their white bean hummus plate is also delicious .   the other thing i love about trident is they do what ,  in my opinion ,  all restaurants with burgers should do ,  they say at the top you can take any burger and substitute a veggie patty .   it ' s baffling to me how many places don ' t even offer a veggie burger at all  ( they ' re frozen !   not that hard to keep them stocked !  )  or if they do ,  they ' re hesitant or unwilling to accommodate a request to add it to a different burger than the one veggie burger listed on the menu .   why in the world ,  if you already have veggie patties on hand ,  do i have to order the one veggie burger you have listed ?   why can ' t i just substitute the veggie patty onto any other option ?   it drives me bonkers .   but for trident ,  this is never the case !   the mushroom swiss looks good to you ?   they ' ll make it with a veggie patty .   the green chile burger looks great ?   they ' ll make it a veggie .   etc .  ,  etc .  ,  etc .   it ' s a standard boca burger ,  which are ok .   normally i avoid boca burgers ,  but trident makes me excited to eat a veggie burger !   i recommend the green chile with a boca burger ,  and add a fried egg .   side salad and no bun if you want low carb .   or ,  if you ' re indulging ,  side of mac  &  cheese .   for non - vegetarians ,  my friends are always happy to eat here too .   popular choices among my friends include the grilled shrimp skewers ,  the non - veggie burgers ,  the crispy shrimp po - boy ,  and the paleo bowl .   they also have a fully stocked bar .   good prices on their beverages .   and the wait staff has always been friendly and kind .   word of caution ,  if there ' s football on ,  it ' s probably going to be crowded here .   so plan accordingly .

    "text": "what a wonderful find here in newtown pa .  an authentic indian restaurant with a charming cozy atmosphere and food to die for !  we found it tucked in a little business center across from the dunkin donuts in newtown pa .  it is brand new and has taken over the same spot as mamita ' s latino had .  it is worth seeking it out if you want to try real deal quality indian food .  we were seated by a friendly gentleman and fresh papadam  ( which is a crispy wafer - like cracker / tortilla )  and chutneys were brought to the table immediately .   the appetizers we had were potato samosas with a delicious tamarind chutney and a biting fresh cilantro chutney .  very crispy and filled with savory potatoes and peas in a crispy wrap .  both were excellent .    we also had chili paneer ,  which really could be an entree .  it was as hot as i wanted it to be but still you can tell a deft hand ,  who knows spices ,  created this dish  ( yummy beyond words !  )  and a we tried an interesting panipuri .  it was  a twist on the typical one you see on the sunday buffets .  this one was filled with crunchy toasted confetti and creamy avocado .  light and refreshing !  perhaps ,  you can tell my family loves appetizers and it would have been plenty of food if we stopped there but since it was so good we couldn ' t help but try as many things as our chubby tummies would hold .   northern indian food has always been my favorite style of indian food but it can be heavy .  it seems some restaurants think the more cream and butter the better but guru ' s knows how to balance richness without killing all the flavors of the dish .  so ,  being the hungry hungry hippos we are ,  here are our entrees :  palak aloo -  which is spicy ,  smooth spinach and potatoes ,  chili chicken -  an indo chinese dish that was seasoned to mouth watering perfection  , kind of like a general tso ' s on steroids and spice .  it is one of our favorites .  paneer makhni -  a homemade indian cheese cube kind of  like a tasty tofu but better . in creamy tomato curried sauce  . it ' s rich and creamy but not drowning in fat like so many other restaurants .  the breads are fresh made to order .  we found out this place is a byob so that certainly is a plus for our next visit .  we had mango lassi and , chai tea this time but an indian beer would be awesome with this meal .     we finally surrendered after we tried the kheer which is indian rice pudding  .  ( forget about the gloopy baby food the diners sell this is awesome )   . we can ' t wait to try the buffet that will be starting thursday september 3rd 2015 . ",

    "text": "had lunch here for my birthday on october 7th and was not disappointed .   it was definitely one of the go to restaurants on this small pier and we really didn ' t have to wait that long to be seated .  there was seating both outside and inside ,  but we decided to sit indoors since it was a bit windy and hot outside since we were literally in the ocean on the pier .   my boyfriend got us the shrimp cocktail salad and the 4lb  ( maybe it was 6lbs lolz )  crab to share that was the special of the day .  but out waiter had informed us that they ran out of the specific crab we wanted ,  but gave us two different crabs that was equivalent to the weight of the crab that we missed out on .   once our food arrived ,  we dug right in .  everything tasted ,  so delicious and fresh .  we finished off everything that we ordered and made sure not to leave any sort of crab meat morsel behind .  the shrimp salad was surprisingly good .  it was light and the shrimps were juicy .  the crabs had their own different flavors and came with really crispy onion rings on the side and melted butter .    i definitely will come back here again cause pricey as it was we definitely got our monies worth !

    "text": "in my mind ,  a line out the door and sometimes filling out into the parking lot can never be a bad thing .  this line situation has always been the case ,  and i ' ve been coming here since i was little girl when trips home from grandmas on i - 70 meant taking a detour off the interstate to gray brothers cafeteria .  the lines may be long ,  but the place is huge ,  there are at least 3 very large rooms for dining ,  so don ' t worry about not being able to get a seat .  the wait staff is friendly and will help carry your trays ,  bring you drink refills ,  etc .    gray ' s certainly has the best tasting cafeteria food i ' ve ever had .  if i didn ' t go through the line looking at all the options myself ,  i would have thought someone ' s grandma or mom was back there serving up all of these home cooking favorites .    obviously ,  the strawberry pie is iconic .  it is good ,  a little sweet and syrupy for me .  i like the sugar cream pie better personally .    and again ,  obviously ,  the fried chicken is also iconic .  but that is finger licking good .  sometimes i opt for the chicken strips because i find them easier to eat  -  but all of their chicken is tasty .  as are all of their meat and fish entrees i ' ve tried .    now for the sides .  the sides .  i am a mac n cheese expert ,  let me tell you ,  and this is the best i ' ve ever had .  perfection .  i wish i could get that for my entree .    the mashed potatoes and gravy are great ,  the green beans are great ,  the corn is great ,  heck ,  even the broccoli is great .   if i haven ' t convinced you to come here by now ,  i ' m not sure if it will ever happen .  but if your mouth is watering even a little bit after reading this review ,  i highly suggest making your way down to mooresville ,  indiana and heading to gray ' s .  it is worth the drive .  promise .

    "text": "i stopped using yelp because i became lazy and didn ' t feel like spending 10 - 15 after eating to write about a restaurant ,  but this place changed my way of thinking !   federal donuts opened up in my neighborhood 5 - 6 years ago and i never stopped in to try it out .  after hear one raving review after another ,  i said enough is enough and took a walk over .  .  . and i was not disappointed  ( except for one minor factor )  .   upon walking in the women behind the counter were so sweet and patient .  i told them it was my first time and they were more than happy to work with me while i surveyed the entire menu .  eventually i ended up ordering for my dad and i two chicken sandwiches and two cinnamon sugar  \" fresh and hot \"  donuts ,  and a cold brew coffee for myself .  this is where the one bad part of my experience comes in :  the price .  these five items came to  $ 21 . 60 ,  which i believe is quite expensive .   the cold brew coffee is soooo good .  i feel like most places try to nail it down and can never get it right ,  but federal donuts sure did !  it had a very robust coffee flavor .   the chicken sandwich was absolutely delicious ;  the chicken was juicy with a crispy battered outside ,  the seasoning was nice and balanced ,  the touch of sauce was just right ,  and the potato bun was very fresh .   the cinnamon sugar donut .  .  . just ,  wow .  these people don ' t lie when they say it ' s  \" hot and fresh .  \"  it was warm ,  soft ,  moist ,  and loaded with cinnamon sugar .  i could easily eat 3 - 4 of those things in one sitting .  at  $ 1 . 50 a piece you are paying a premium for quality .    despite the price being a little high ,  i will definitely be back to try their other varieties of donuts and chicken .  10 / 10  ( or 5 / 5 ,  according to yelp )  .

    "text": "this is probably the best restaurant i have ever eatin at that was inside a holiday inn ,  and actually one of the better ones i have been to period .  i would normally give it 4 stars ,  but considering where it is ,  i think it deserves an extra star .  normally ,  holiday inn restaurants are terrible places ,  and i avoid them ,  but it was late ,  and we were exhausted ,  so we gave it a chance .  bossman got the porkchop that was about 4 inches thick  ( no kidding )  and i got the bourbon chicken .  both were excellent ,  and the pork wasn ' t tough ,  which was surprising considering how big those chops were .    a few things about alton :   east alton is a rusty old industry town ,  a place in its hay day made some awesome stuff .  they still have winchester making ammunition their and olin brass cranking out precision copper and brass alloys .  unfortunately ,  my reason to go  there was to decommission some research equipment at the olin brass metals research lab .  yeah ,  the bean counters shut down the research department .  stupid .  i wonder what the heck is going to keep this country going in the future .    also ,  alton was home to the worlds tallest man .

( if you ' re worried about your cardiovascular health ,  please don ' t eat this one .  )  it is your classic bacon burger topped with melted cheese and fried mac - n - cheese .  let ' s just say it changed me .  fries are amazing and paired perfectly with their unique sauces .  loved the sriracha mayo .  a must try .    they also serve a million types of sodas including draft sodas ,  shakes  ( loved the cinnamon shake )  as well as boozy shakes which are as wonderful wd they sound .    if you ' re looking for the place in downtown st .  louis ,  please stop here .

    "text": "had the best time at 3 muses !  made a reservation  ( highly recommended as this place is small and busy )  .  when we got there ,  our table was almost ready so the hostess asked us to wait at the bar .  we got a drink while we were waiting and the bartender happily transferred our tab to our table .  they had a specialty house drink which my boyfriend and i both tried ,  it wasn ' t my taste but he loved it .  there was a band playing that night ,  and our table was close by .  the band was wonderful ,  played excellent jazz !  the food is served tapas style so it comes out as it ' s ready .  we started with the fries ,  topped with feta cheese which were perfectly crispy and delicious .  we got the bulgogi rice bowl which was flavorful but could have had a little more meat and vegetables to go with the rice .  we were still hungry so we got an order of the mac  &  cheese and the bruschetta which were both phenomenal ,  i recommend getting each .  after my house drink i had one of the beers ,  the fire ant ,  which was delicious .  at the end of our meal the hostess came by to ask us if we minded moving to the sidebar table as they were behind on the reservations .  it was a little offputting to be asked to move after spending  $ 80 on a meal ,  but i understood and we happily moved .  i read reviews that the servicehere was lacking and the bartenders were rude ,  but this was not our experience .  the server was attentive ,  and the bartender was extremely friendly and helpful in ordering and was happy to transfer our tab for us .  we will happily be back on our next visit to new orleans !  !

    "text": "i was really hoping they would do something nice with this location ,  since it was my beloved old favorite spot to go to by myself .  this is the old filo ' s ,  i spent many nights there having a few drinks ,   listening and dancing to great music by the worship crew ,  then walking home .    we decided to check this place out one friday night when a friend from out of town was visiting .  it was the perfect atmosphere and food in the downstairs lounge area .  the music the dj was playing was great and funky ,  yet not too loud ,  so that we could still hold a conversation .  the food was spectacular ,  we had the ceviche de callos con sandia  ( watermelon and scallop ceviche )  ,  i wasn ' t sure what to expect ,  it was not like the typical ceviche i have had before ,  but it was delicious .  we also had the queso fundido ,  one with chorizo and the other with mushrooms .  they were both devine !   they also have a reverse happy hour special in the lounge :  thursday  -  saturday ,  10pm - 12am .  we had some tasty margaritas  ( although not the best i have had ,  but good enough for the price )  ,  and we were feeling really nice by the time we left there ,  not too full ,  it was the perfect amount of food ,  and we still had some  $  in our pocket !   i am definitely looking forward to going back to xochitl .

    "text": "marrakesh is a total package dining experience .  not only do you get to eat authentic moroccan cuisine ,  you get to enjoy a cultural experience as well .    you may have walked past marrakesh or the surrounding streets many times without even realizing it was there ,  like i had prior to this visit .  it ' s nestled on leithgow street just a notch off of south street .  forget south street or even the rest of philadelphia for that matter .  you are about to step into a different world .  to enter you must ring the doorbell on the side door .    i felt more like i was going to a house ,  than a restaurant ;  especially with the shower located in the restroom on the second floor .  during my entire visit ,  i never felt like i was at a restaurant .  i felt comfortable and relaxed .  maybe eating with your hands with a towel on your lap has that effect .    i found my group of fellow yelpers in a cozy private room .   the room had four tables with booth seating along the outskirts of the room .  ottoman like chairs took up the rest of the space for the rest of us .  with such a large group in not the largest of spaces ,  it got loud .   our meal started with customary hand - washing and we were even entertained twice with a belly dancer .  after placing our order ,  the food kept flowing .  the service was probably the most unobtrusive service i ' ve ever had .  as one dish was placed in front of us ,  another was seamlessly removed .  i felt like royalty or at least someone enjoying a nice meal at someone ' s dinner party .  the regular dining formalities i ' m used to were thrown out the window ,  and it was fantastic !    as i ' m sure you ' re aware ,  this  $ 25 prix fixe menu has seven courses and you are welcome to byob .  while it was a ton of food ,  i walked in the door absolutely starving and walked out not overly stuffed .  i believe most people left absolutely full ,  so maybe the tip is to come in extremely hungry .  here ' s a little rundown of dining experience :   course 1 :  three - salad platter -  the eggplant is phenomenal  ( and messy )  .  luckily you have some assistance from the pita to eat it .  the cucumbers and bell peppers and carrots and cucumber were good ,  but the eggplant stole the show .    course 2 :  the b ' stella -  as someone who doesn ' t normally love sweets but loves cinnamon ,  carbs and meat ,  this dish was a winner .  this dish was dough filled with chicken ,  nuts ,  almonds ,  egg ,  peppers and onions .  it was really hot at first ,  but once you cracked open the shell and let it cool down ,  it was easier to eat .  i had some pita saved from the first course ,  so i found it easy to break off a piece and rest it on the pita while it cooled down .  truly a sweet - savory delight .    course 3 :  chicken -  so here ' s where the choices began .  you can either get chicken with lemon or spicy chicken .  my group opted to get the spicy chicken with the cumin sauce on the side .  the chicken was melt in your hands and then melt in your mouth good .  the spicy sauce had a nice kick without being overly spicy to me .  i still had some pita leftover so i did a little dipping with the sauce .    course 4 :  beef or lamb -  my table got a little creative here and asked for half portions of both the beef and lamb .  the beef was served shish kebab style ,  and to be honest ,  not my favorite .  it was a little well done ,  and i struggled a little to get it off the stick resulting in a pepper flying into my husband ' s wine glass .  sauvignon blanc tastes best with a little pepper anyways ,  right ?  the lamb was perfect .  even the non - lamb eaters thought it was delicious .  it was tender and took on the flavor of the chick peas and onions without having an overwhelming lamb flavor .    course 5 :  couscous with veggies ,  chick peas and raisins -  this was probably my least favorite dish from the main meal .  it was a little blander than other couscous dishes i ' ve tried in the past .  i would have been disappointed if this was the only thing i ordered ,  but everything was a hit thus far in the evening .  they did give us spoons at this point ,  so don ' t worry about eating the little grains with your hands .   courses 6  &  7 :  dessert -  i ' m assuming the tea ,  fruit and pastries count as the sixth and seventh courses .  at this point in the evening ,  my bottle of wine had been consumed and i wasn ' t counting the dishes ,  and am making this assumption while referencing the menu .  i ' m not a tea fan so i passed .  the pastries were little crisp triangles that reminded me of baklava .  the fruit came out frozen was a little hard to eat .  i nibbled on a strawberry and took a banana for the road since the majority of the group passed on the fruit .  perhaps the fruit was customary ,  but i thought a little unnecessary .  if it ' s part of the traditional meal then no harm ,  no foul .     to sum it up ,  i had delicious food and hours of fun .  it ' s an experience not to be missed in philadelphia ,  especially if you go with an adventurous group of friends .  while i couldn ' t imagine going to marrakesh every friday night ,  i can definitely pick a handful of occasions that would be a perfect fit .

    "text": "i think i might even like this tria a smidge better than the rittenhouse location ,  after sitting in the litlte upstairs section which had much more breathing space than the smaller 19th st spot .  the waitress we had was as good as ones we ' ve had in previous locations :  super cheerful ,  adorable ,  and prompt at checking on drinks and clearing away the plates .   we went today to check out pliny the younger ,  and while the ensuing scene was a little chaotic  ( maybe drink tickets would have been easier ?  )  with two lines on either side of the store ,  they did the best they could ,  letting in 10 people at a time until the restaurant was filled .  we were worried about our friend ,  who was running late and doesn ' t like beer ,  not being allowed in ,  but she had no problems after letting the host know we were waiting for her .   the food was also delicious .  we all shared the asturian blue cheese which was nicely complimented by a blackberry sauce ,  i had the wild mushroom sandwich which had a lovely lemony flavor ,  my boyfriend had the three cheese sandwich  ( which i have ordered before and is quite good )  ,  and our friend had the truffled egg toast ,  which we have also tried before and is one of the standout starter items .   all in all ,  i have yet to be disappointed by an experience at a tria in either location ,  even with these crazy extenuating circumstances !

( ferry tip :  the fare is  $ 2 per person each way .   bring  * exact change *  .  )     i ' d recommend calling him on the way so he knows you are arriving .   we ate a late breakfast before the class and that worked great .   keep in mind that it takes a while to cook everything ,  so don ' t expect to eat until late afternoon .   you don ' t want to be cooking while you are starving .   my wife has a couple of food allergies and we let him know in advance .   chef made some adjustments to accommodate ,  although he wasn ' t able to eliminate the allergens completely .

( although the butter cake starts getting stale within hours so eat it fast )  they are always so nice ;  gave a cookie to my daughter today while we waited in line .  most importantly ,  i just leaned they make breakfast sandwiches on fridays ,  saturdays and sundays .  they are excellent and come with western potatoes and a croissant .  you can see one half of a breakfast sandwich in my picture .  all of this for just  $ 6 . 99 .  a very good value considering their normal bakery items are a bit expensive  -  but worth it .

    "text": "always worth the wait .  filling this review out after i ' ve gone a few times  ( 5 - 6 times )  .  immaculate baked goods ,  inspiring latte combinations ,  creative soulful brunch food .  i recommend grabbing a latte and a baked good to munch on while you wait .    i ' ve had few dishes i haven ' t loved .   i normally find it hard to narrow down the options ,  i normally ask the wait staff bc there always seems to be a few dishes that rise above the others .  the sorghum bacon is always pretty impressive and a crowd pleaser and i ' ve definitely ordered a few different versions of the dutch baby .  happy brunching !

    "text": "delicious .   my friend and i stopped here last night after a concert at festival pier .  we were both starving so we ordered the bacon grease popped popcorn before our waiter even said hello .  the waiter was awesome ,  friendly and very attentive .  the popcorn was so incredibly delicious seasoned perfectly with cayenne and paprika type spices .  i cannot wait to eat it again !  !  !  !    i got the burger and fries ,   both so good .  the burger was juciy ,  definitely better than your average .  it can definitely compete with fountain porter and silk city .   my friend got the fried chicken ,  mac and cheese and a biscuit .   the biscuit was huge and incredibly good .  moist ,  dense and perfect flavor .   not too floury or salty .   the mac and cheese was soooo good .  i usually do not like mac and cheese unless it is homemade at restaurants because it just tastes flavorless and salty .  but this mac and cheese was definitely homemade and it was delicious ,  there was so much cheese and it had a delicious crust on top .     basically ,  i cannot wait to go back again this place was so great .

    "text": "4 - star beer ,  5 - star ambiance .  this is the most impressive and promising brewery in santa barbara .    inside they have a high ceiling ,  exposed wood rafters and black underlayment with an array of chalkboard panels for the tap list .  it looks like the tap list changes by switching out these large panels ,  which give you the beer name and its essential characteristics like ibus ,  abv ,  style ,  volume poured .  the list looked inspired with a range of styles from sours ,  berliners ,  stouts ,  pilsners ,  and ipas .   they offer very nice tasting flights ,  which our group did .  you grab a draft list and just tick the ones you want to try .  this system takes a lot of work and annoyance out of the process  -  a great idea .  the beer quality was a bit all over the place ,  which is expected from a new brewery .  however ,  some showed a lot of promise and i think third window has what it takes to improve their recipes .  detailed notes are below .  i ended up liking their pilsner ,  the light ,  the best and got it in a large format mug pour .    pretzels and popcorn are available ,  which is a nice touch .  dog friendly interior is a huge bonus as well .    ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~   extra feedback for beer nerds and the brewery :   the light 1 . 1 this was an outstanding german style pilsner with a bright lemon lime nose with beautiful citrus zestiness .  hefty carbonation and brilliant clarity much appreciated .  the flavor was dry and a tad powdery ,  but the finish was neutral and refreshing .  this was my absolute favorite of the beers i tried so i got a large pour in a giant mug .    brett saison looking beautiful in the glass ,  glowing neon yellow with generous carbonation .  the aroma is sawdust ,  barn ,  candied mango .  the flavor is bubbly ,  neautral ,  and very dry but not abrasive .  refreshing ,  though a tad washed out in the flavor .   rakau welch looking identical to the brett saison but with a more impressive aroma with fresh corn grits ,  lemongrass ,  dill ,  fennel ,  oregano  -  super herbal .  the flavor is dry ,  neutral ,  refreshing .  the farmyard character of saison is spot on here .  simple ,  dry ,  but not abrasive .   xexo super dry for an ipa that wants to deliver sticky caramel aromas and flavor ,  but the palate is way too washed out and the bitterness becomes abrasive .  needed some work .    the \u00f6ko bomb inky black in color ,  but much too thin a body for stout .  the nose is savory chocolate mousse ,  big raisin ,  chocolate covered raisin .  but the flavor is too dry and moves to grape soda ,  grape cough syrup and tootsie roll .   executioner ' s daughter clear amber in color .  this one had intense vinegar  ( acetic acid )  and nail polish remover  ( ethyl acetate )  in the nose .  taste is very nice ,  however ,  with cinnamon ,  mild sugar ,  dark bread ,  banana nut bran muffin .  great mouthfeel .   the origin 2016 this was billed as a dry - hopped apa ,  but the aroma was sticky with thick caramel and butterscotch .  the flavor was watery and bland .  overall ,  it seemed dead and not what was intended .
