    "text": "so we know we have many options out there when it comes to dining out .  so tonight the kids wanted steak .  we are from out of town ,  here for part business and part pleasure .   called ahead seating ,  time was about 20 - 30mins ,  perfect ,  no problem .  we arrived and waited for maybe 5 mins in the lobby .  so far so good .  there was 5 of us ,  so they put us in a booth that fits 4 ppl ,  and added a chair at the end .  cool ,  no big deal .  server ,  stefanie came by ,  took drink order ,  came back and we were ready to order our food .  so we did .  she was very tentative ,  we never had to ask for a refill ,  not even once .  that ' s good service right there .  i will give credit where credit is deserved .  so ,  we all decided on having steak tonight .  two youngest wants steak bites ,  med cooked ,  oldest daughter wants hers med rare ,  my ribeye med ,  and husbands prime rib medium .   after 30 mins ,  8 : 30 server says she doesn ' t understand why our food hasn ' t come out yet she will check ,  cool .  still no food .  food finally came out steak bites were cold .  matter of fact everything was cold .  ok ,  so food sat in the window .  got someone by the name of jamie ,  guest relation guy and told him our food is cold ,  he apologized and took food to kitchen for recook .  he said he would personally see it that they cook it right ,  he never return to our table .  time goes by ,  veru slowly ,  watching every other table who came in same with us or even after us get their food .  so we wait ,  about 9 : 25 ,  the remake came out ,  ran by the service manager ,  jodi .  this was the first time that she ever came to us .  brought food ,  had the nerve to ask  \"  how are you doing \"  i replied with angry and hungry ,  she had no apologies ,  nothing .  food still was not hot ,  two younger kids food was still well done .  i even had jodi touch the steak bites with her finger ,  and asked her if it was cold or hot .  she said herself that it was cold .  i asked her would she have let her kids eat that ?  ?  ?  she couldn ' t answer me .  at this point i ' m pretty frustrated .  she said what would i like for her to do .  i said ,  it would be nice to have the kitchen recook it stat ,  since we have been waiting since 8pm .  as a service manager or any kind of manager ,  she should be embarrassed to run the food out without looking at the ticket seeing that it was all supposed to be medium cooked .  she could not ,  would not  ,  do anything to keep me from being so angry ,  and so disappointed because we have never had a problem with any texas roadhouse before .   so i told her to take the damn food away ,  and the kitchen manager aj came out .  i asked her to sit next to me and i explained what was going on to her .  she seems to understand  ,  but didnt know what to do .  i told her ,  i want the owners business card ,  and some kind of compensation for being there almost 2 damn hours and my kids were hungry .  they were very patience and to the end ,  still did not have dinner .   here ' s how i would handle the situation .  as a sserver i would tell the manager immediately that the food is taking long .  then when food came out make sure manager would come by and check on guests .  that never happened .  so when food is sent back ,  manager needs to be aware immediately .  and food will be recooked immediately ,  stat ,  and go out to the table and apologize .  that was not done at all .  instead she comes out  ,  so unprofessional ,  and made situation even worse .   so i have never been so angry ever at any restaurants .  if i was the owner ,  i would call the guest back asap ,  and see how to get the guest back and give their restaurant another chance .  i got the business card and did call mr .  michael  ( owner )  we ' ll see if he returns the call .   in the end aj did get an approval from her owner over the phone to give us a certificate to return for two free meals for 2 adults .  i wouldn ' t want to come back unless i get an invite from the owners and on the day they work to ensure that this does not happened again .  so again we ' ll see if they will reach out to their guest concerns .   ovtall ,  i wouldnt give this restaurant any stars for the food service ,  but for the server she was good .  she still should have checked on her tables food and made sure it didn ' t just in the window .  but she was busy ,  i guess i can understand .   very poor guest relation from service manager jodi and jamie never came back to check on us .    in the end ,  had to go else where at 10pm to get food for kids .  i ' m still pretty upset and frustrated with this restaurant .    you have many options when dining out ,  please do not go here .  .  .  .  . ever .  check ratings and find another texas roadhouse .

    "text": "was recommended to try mcalister ' s by my friend charlie .  upon entering ,  it looked to be a restaurant styled after st .  louis bread co .  and i was eager to see how it compared .   the answer is not well .   i got cheddar potato soup in a bread bowl .  the soup tasted like a watered down version of campbell ' s -  - just chunks of potato ,  celery ,  and carrots in a cream broth .  the breadbowl tasted stale ,  like it had been taken out of a fridge and reheated in the microwave .  i finished the soup because i was hungry but just left the bowl to sit there .   charlie got a caesar salad ,  which was just some lettuce with cheese and croutons sprinkled on top .  the lettuce was slimy and the croutons were soggy by the time they were brought to the table .   the service was friendly and the prices weren ' t expensive ,  but the food was absolutely abysmal .  don ' t waste your money -  - stick with bread co .

( eww !  )  if you want to relax at a resort ,  don ' t stay here because with all those convention people ,  loud cleaning staff ,  24 hour music and thin walls you will only end up with more stress .   4 .  the size :  it ' s no joke that you will get lost in this hotel .  it ' s inexplicably large .  and when it hits noon ,  you should already be in one of the few restaurants because they fill up fast .  with several conventions happening at one time ,  getting a  \" quick bite \"  is not possible here .  and there ' s not really any place close by ,  either .  you can walk over to the mall for some fast food but plan enough time for your walk  -  getting out of the hotel takes at least 5 minutes .   i ' m sure glad i was there for a convention and didn ' t pay out of my own pocket for this ridiculous hotel .

    "text": "gross .  the restaurant is dirty ,  and tables were allowed to sit forever with used trays and half - eaten food on them .  the service was slow and it wasn ' t that crowded .  i ordered a shrimp platter ,  an order of mozzarella sticks ,  and a root beer ,  which came up to  $ 16 .  steep !   my mozzarella sticks tasted awful -  - wayyy too salty ,  first of all ,  and they were just frozen sticks out of a box .  there were five of them ,  so i paid a dollar a stick for frozen crap that was too salty to even eat .  i ate one and ended up tossing the rest .   the shrimp were likewise cooked out of a box of frozen junk ,  and somehow they had managed to overcook them so they were kind of hard .  the shrimp inside were super - small and it was mostly breading .  five shrimp came with soggy ,  mediocre fries ,  some bread ,  a small side salad ,  and cole slaw .  i ate like six fries and by that time i had given up on my meal ,  so i can ' t report on the slaw ,  salad ,  or bread .  my can of soda was not even very cold ,  so they managed to screw that one up ,  too .   this place charges way too much to be serving such crappy food .  from the dilapidated atmosphere ,  it is clear that no care or pride really goes into this restaurant .  i ' ll certainly never be back .

    "text": "for all i ' m about to say ,  i feel i have to mention again that this is an honest review and i ' m not even embellishing much on my experience here .  i ' ll give them two stars .    one extra star because they did something i can appreciate out here in the middle of the usa .  they didn ' t try to charge me  $ 8 for a simple vietnamese sandwich .  you guys have to understand that these banh mi sandwiches are a dollar in asia !  !  !  they are  $ 2 - 3 dollars in california but for some dang reason they are  $ 5 - 8 in the heart of the usa .  i ate it up gratefully and happily .  it wasn ' t as good as the last banh mi i had which was in se asia  ( mystery meat and questionable cleanliness standards but soooo dang tasty and i felt fine after eating it )  ,  but it hit my craving spot like a hammer .   along with a banh mi was an order of goi cuon  ( spring rolls )  .  the rolls were pretty small and the dipping sauce was crap .  i ' m sorry for not sugar coating ,  but it was absolutely crap .  like i tasted it and was like ,   \" dude wtf is this ?  !  ?  !  \"  it was bland ,  and the strangest color i ' ve ever seen in a goi cuon dipping sauce .  it was like a light grayish brown with a less than creamy little bit more watery than creamy diarrhea texture .  it was a very stupid dipping sauce .  if people in indiana say ,   \" i hate vietnamese food .  \"  i would first blame this restaurant as the prime culprit .  i would rebut with ,   \" did you ,  by chance ,  eat at saigon restaurant ?  \"  if this was someone ' s sole venture into vietnamese food ,  i plead for them to try somewhere better and give it another try .   the next dish up .  .  .  hu tieu bo kho .  beef stew with noodles .  the beef was nice and tender and there were some great bits of tendon and carrot ,  but seriously .  .  .  no real bo kho looks like what we were served .  the broth should be a rich dark brown with a bit of orange oil highlighting the surface .  this just looked like very dirty pho broth .  this is not the beef stew you serve to dip bread in .  i feel like i was being served counterfeit vietnamese food .  i think that ' s why i ' m not happy writing this review .    fortunately there seems to be some competition in indianapolis for viet restaurants though .  i hope that puts some fire in the competition and makes for better quality authentic viet grub .  if restaurants like this one is killing the first impression to the indiana market ,  there may be no coming back !   it gets worse .  the viet iced coffee tasted like soap .  i cannot explain it .  did they not rinse the glasses throughly ?  perhaps it was the viet coffee press that still had dish soap in it ?  what happened there ?  it was nasty .   it gets worse .  i ' ve been around .  i ' ve lived in a single bedroom apartment with a family of six with a billion cockroaches as a child .  i ' ve lived in cheap motel rooms with roaches and the smell of bug spray in the sheets .  i ' ve eaten whole meals in other countries with cockroaches crawling up the wall .  but for some reason this kinda irked me .  .  .  i saw our waiter at the counter visually tracking a bug on the counter .  then swat at it with his hand .  then move things around a bit and try to kill it again .  in my mind i imagined a cockroach was his victim .  i watched and watched .  .  .  but did not notice any washing of hands after that hunting trip .  why were there no towels drying off his hands within the next five minutes ?  why did his hands not seem moist at any time between this occurring and him serving our food ?  like i said ,  i ' m used to bugs ,  i don ' t like them and they still gross me out ,  but i can convince myself some stuff is okay .  .  .  but why not wash your hands bro ?  take some of that extra soap that was in my coffee and give it a go .  .  .  i ' d really appreciate it a lot .  i ' m sure the health department would as would the customers !  it wouldn ' t take much more time out of your day .   i came to indianapolis in search of good asian food that would solve a series of cravings .  i ' ll keep looking .  louisville has some great solutions .  perhaps ohio is where i ' ll look next .  .  .   i ' m thinking of taking away that extra star .  .  .  yeah .  .  .

    "text": "you get what you see -  - chicken fingers .  they also serve wings and other overpriced items like mac and cheese  ( mediocre )  and pastries  ( meh )  .    the sauces are unique and probably the best part about this place as you won ' t be able to find sauces like this elsewhere .  be watchful of how full the sauce is because some of the containers are not completely full and you get jipped .  sadly you can ' t sample the sauces without having to buy them .  my favorite is bar b q sauce .  it has a slight acidic vinegar kick ,  but isn ' t bittersweet .  maybe they cut back on the sugar ?  the chipotle lime mayo is great .  it isn ' t too creamy and oily .  the chipotle is subtle ,  almost dull and a little bit more would make it better and bold .  i found myself having to double dunk the chicken in this sauce to really taste it .  you always finish it wishing you had a little more .  i ' ve tried almost all of them and none of them are too memorable that i can recall anything great or bad about the rest of the sauces .   the breading is thin and crisp ,  which i appreciate .  with one bite you taste the breading and chicken ,  and not just breading on heavily breaded chicken that other places might serve .  the breading can be over salty and seasoned too much .  don ' t mistake this for rich and intense .  it is salty .  i end up drinking a lot of water with this meal partially due to this .  what makes the breading suck is that it is not always fresh .  who knows how long the chicken has been sitting out .   the meat can be hit or miss ;  the chicken can be a little parched .  this is disappointing when you have a whole pound of chicken to consume that will leave your mouth dry and leave you bloated after you drink a lot to quench your thirst and high sodium intake .  more often then not ,  i always get the dried ,  salty chicken instead of the juicy ,  tender chicken that i once got at my very first visit .  perhaps i am unlucky and get the left over stale pieces that have been sitting out long .  i can only recall once when my chicken was tender and juicy when they first opened . i try to avoid wasting money here because i have not had the same type of meal since my first .  however ,  out of desperation to try something different than the usual univ city food ,  i have eaten here a few times to make this review justified .   what my friends and i would like to do is split up and someone get french fries from greek lady and the others get chicken from wishbone .  we would satisfy our elementary palates by eating chicken fingers and french fries .  if you are willing to walk a few more blocks ,  allegros has really good curly fries but portions are a lot bigger when you eat at the place .   i would have given this place 1 . 5 stars for the food ,  but they once cancelled a chicken wing eating contest on my friends and me just hours prior to the event with poor explanation so i knock it down to 0 . 5 stars ,  but yelp doesn ' t have 0 . 5 increments .

( not that we intentionally counted but there was 5 of us and we agreed everyone was going to get 4 each ,  equaling 20 )  we brought it to our servers attention who disappeared for long periods of a time .  it seemed like we always had to look around to try to find him and flag him down .  it was very annoying ,  the server to the table next to us was more attentive to his table than ours was to ours .  15 mins gone by after we told him ,  still nothing .  finally he came back and by this time we just wanted our check .  when we recieved our check we were still charged full price for the wings .  whatever ,  it ' s just 1 wing but the more we thought about it the more we got upset because it seemed as tho they didn ' t care about customer service much .  we seemed like a joke to them complaining about a missing wing .  my bf flagged down the manager and when we brought it to his attention ,  he basically blew us off and said  \" i ' ll take off a dollar for you .  \"  now that was insulting .  then out of nowhere our server came over with a plate with just 1 wing on it since he seen us looking for the manager .  we don ' t give a daym about the wing .  this is poor customer service .  if we would have went anywhere else ,  they would have apologized for the mistake which we all would have understood ,  it happens .  then asked us if we needed anything and immediately replaced what was missing and on top of that added some more .  now that ' s customer service .  for what they did ,  we will not becoming back ever again .  it was a daym joke .    so you have been warned ,  do not go here and expect good service because they really don ' t give a daym about you .  it was a rip off .

    "text": "i ' m still very confused by my dining experience last night .  a friend and i decided to try a new sushi place for dinner and landed on crazy sushi .  we got to the restaurant with a bottle of wine and both of us were very hungry .  we were seated at a table ,  given menus and the hostess opened our bottle .  we chatted a bit ,  had some wine ,  and looked over the menu .  the first 5 minutes we were there the waiter came over 3 times to ask if we were ready to order the menu is huge so it took us some time .  we finally ordered ,  food came out quickly ,  very quickly .  the server paid no attention to the fact that some of our belongings were on the table  ( keys ,  cell phones ,  etc )  before we could move anything he placed our plates directly on top of everything .  we ate ,  food was good not great ,  we split 2 rolls and a bento box ,  with the intention of ordering more if this was not filling enough .  before we finished eating we were brought our check ,  which destroyed any possibility of ordering more .  we ate all the sushi and were picking at the bento box and drinking our wine when our server came over to take our check ,  my friend stopped him because we had not put our money in it yet and explained that we were still eating and drinking and not ready to pay .  then the waiter said  \" so you can ' t pay your bill and finish your food ?  \"  so so so rudely .  we both stared at him in shock as he continued to rush us to pay him and get out of the restaurant .  i have never experienced anything like it ,  mind you we were not even there for an hour when this occurred .  we were so uncomfortable we did not finish the food or wine and just left .  we won ' t be back ,  mostly because it was the weirdest ,  most rushed ,  rudest service i have ever experienced .

    "text": "the food is usually good .  unfortunately if you order delivery you have to wait more than two hours to get your food ,  with a chance of not getting it at all .    placed a order via grub - hub last night at 10 : 59 pm with estimated delivery being between 12 : 15 am and 12 : 25 am .  at 1 : 30 am i called them to see if the food would be delivered soon .  the man on the phone so they were really backed up with orders and it should be there in a couple minutes .  at 2 : 30 am i decided just cancel the order with grubhub .    i completely understand being busy but waiting three hours for food is unacceptable .   if i ever order from oregon steaks again i will be sure to drive there and pick up my food .  food is good service is awful but i guess that ' s what you get when you order from a place that ' s  open 24 hours and you place the order after 9 pm on a tuesday .

    "text": "my brother ,  myself and a friend of ours stopped in to the nite owls saloon  &  grill on saturday to have a few drinks and so they could play pool .  there was a fair amount of people in the bar but it was by no means packed .  we stood at the end of the bar for about 10 minutes waiting for the bartender to come take our order however she was in a conversation with whom we later discovered was her boyfriend at the end of the bar .   finally a waitress came over and got us a few drinks .  the guys attempted 3 games of pool but the table was not working correctly and wouldn ' t release the cue ball .  my brother wanted another drink and waited again for quite a bit at the bar while the waitress ignored him .  upon closing his tab and paying for cash ,  the waitress did not return his card to him which prompted a trip back in the morning .  as we were leaving ,  there was a fight breaking out in the parking lot between two men .  if you ' re looking for working pool tables ,  a safe environment and good service then skip the nite owls saloon and grill .

( ok we will say it was because it is a busy night )  our food finally comes out and my chicken farfalle was supposed to have extra farfalle sauce on the side .  no farfalle sauce .  my friend ordered the steak diane and shrimp scampi .  her steak diane was supposed to be mw however it came out medium closer to medium rare .  we informed our server that the steak was not cooked properly and i was still waiting on my farfalle sauce .  the server informed me that she  \" just had not picked up the sauce yet and she would get it \"  .  strike 2 .  she brought me back my farfalle sauce and let ' s just say it wasn ' t farfalle more like alfredo sauce .  when i told the server it was alfredo she took it sniffed the bowl and said ohhh let me fix that .  she came back literally with the same bowl she sniffed and said  \" this is the correct sauce the manager said it ' s the correct sauce \"  .  i told her it was incorrect and i have eaten this many times .  she proceeded to try and explain how it was the correct sauce .  strike 3 !  i am done .  i know what this sauce taste like and that was not right .    i will not be back here and please whatever you do just go to the one in green hills !  the green hills cheesecake factory service is always good and the food is always great .  i ' ve tried this one about 4 times and it always ends up the same .  i ' m angry at the service and the food is never good .  i ' m sitting here at the restaurant writing this review so that in itself should let you know the level of frustration i have tonight !  !  !

    "text": "this was my second visit here ,  and it was much worse than the first .  this restaurant is extremely small ,  and if there aren ' t any seats ,  you are welcome to stand in the back by the bar without seating ,  in the way of all the commotion .  we stood by the bar for about ten minutes before we were asked if we needed something .  we wanted to eat ,  but not standing up .  we saw multiple tables open up ,  and had to ask if we could sit there ,  even though we were the only people waiting .  we finally sat ,  and a young , brunette waitress came and took our order .  we wanted two orders of the short rib fries appetizer ,  since we would be having it as our dinner opposed to sharing it ,  and she looked at us like we asked her to bring the whole cow to our table .  she asked us if we were sure that we wanted two ,  and we confirmed that we did .  the first order came out in about 5 minutes which was amazing .  10 minutes went by ,  then 15 ,  and our server didn ' t even come over to see how our first dish was ,  just stood in the corner chatting .  we got another servers attention after 20 minutes of waiting and let him know we were still waiting on our order .  we also advised him that if it wasn ' t ready ,  to forget about it and we would share the first one .  he came back and told us that it would be out any second .  another ten minutes went by ,  still no dish ,  still nothing from our original server .  we let the young man know that we were no longer interested in the dish that was 25 minutes late ,  and then our original server finally decided to come over !  could you believe the first thing she said was  \" so im hearing that you never got the second batch of fries ?  \"  .  as if it was some kind of rumor .  then had the nerve to ask if we still wanted it .  she took it off the bill but i was extremely disappointed with the service ,  and will certainly not return the next time i am in town .  especially since i got sick in the middle of the night from it .  village whiskey ,  please train your staff how to serve properly ,  and give them some lessons on customer service .

    "text": "i read the reviews and really wanted to try this place .  we both tried the higher end restaurants inside the french quarter and wanted something more of where the locals go to for day to day meals .  we patiently waited in line to get a table .  the waitress / hostess ignored us and took everyone else ' s name down .  even the larger party that arrived later than us and requested to get some beers and wait outside was seated before us .  i went up to the hostess and asked if she can put our name down on the list and she said wait a minute .  we patiently waited again and after she seated more guests ,  i went up to her again and asked if i can put my name down .  she then asked if we can wait at the bar .  we walked over to the bar and waited another 20 minutes and watched her seat more guests that once again arrived much later than us .  at this point i asked if we can have our table now and she said she will seat us once a table is available .  i asked why she couldn ' t give us the table next to the bar and she said that table is taken .  i looked around the entire restaurant and saw that we were the only asians .  i asked again when we can get a table and she smirked and said we can wait a minute .  at this point we decided that we did not want to give our money to a racist establishment .  i get that she may have forgotten to put our name down ,  which is what she told her manager ,  a very nice gentleman by the way ,  but that does not forgive the fact that she smirked when we asked about the table on multiple occasions .  it doesn ' t forgive that she deliberately sat everyone who came in before and after us and kept telling us to wait .  if i was the owner ,  i would have fired her on the spot .  no matter how good the food may be ,  which we didn ' t even get a chance to try ,  because this racist hostess / waitress ruined our dinner plans ,  it ' s not worth our money to be treated like a second class citizen .  i would have expected more from a place that has such a long history of oppression and inequality but boy was i wrong .  this hostess truly ruined our visit to nola and i would never recommend any of my friends or family visiting nola to come try this place .  it ' s not worth the headache or experience .  terrible customer service by a racist hostess / waitress that claims she is right .  please stay away from this place and beware !  please note the date we visited this place was 8 / 14 / 16 at 4 : 30pm .

    "text": "there were two people in front of me .  a young woman was working alone that night .  i watched her take the other two people ' s orders and make their crepes from a pile of already made crepes on the counter and not prepare them fresh as they are supposed to .  she took my order and i asked for a fresh crepe made to order .  she ignored me and made my crepe from her pile of previously made crepes and i could see that she still had at least three more premade crepes yet to use .  my crepe was soggy and a little gross .  i watched her from the moment i stood in line till i left and she did not make one crepe for the three of us .   the next day i was at the mall to deposit a cheque so i went to the crepe works to let them know what happened the night before and get another one to take home .  when i started to tell the guy what happened he cut me off and said i was wrong .  he told me it was impossible and i did not see that .  so i tell him that i know what i saw and it happened for three crepes not just mine .  again he tells me no i ' m wrong they are not allowed to do that and so it was impossible .  i told him that he was calling me a liar which is a bad thing to do to a customer and that i was there and he was not so i would know what happened .  i tried logic as well explaining that the word impossible implies that there is no possible way for her to have done however anyone could make a bunch of crepes and pile them on top of each other .  it ' s not even hard and in fact obviously she did it to cut corners and save time for herself .    for the next twenty mins he tells me that i have no idea what i am talking about ,  that its impossible to happen and that i ' m wrong .  he also has the audacity to say i ' m just in a bad mood so i ' m saying these things because of that .  first of all this guy knows nothing about me and i was in a great mood before when i started to tell him about it i just wanted them to make sure it doesn ' t happen again .  now every time i come to get a crepe he asks me if i ' m in a bad mood or not which makes me feel very uncomfortable .  plus when i told him that his customer service was horrible and no one talks to a customer that way that wants to run a successful business he tells me the owner would treat me exactly the same way .  he gave me a card supposedly with his bosses number on it but after i left a message explaining the whole thing i never heard back .  that was over two weeks ago now .   i do mostly enjoy the crepes although they are never made the way the example looks .  it bothers me that every time i go buy one he asks me if i ' m in a bad mood and makes fun of me .

    "text": "i used to love red lobster but last night will probably be the last time i go ;  especially to the fairview heights location .     the wait was horrendous .   we were told it would be about 45 minutes .   we checked back with the hostess after it was getting close to an hour and we were told it would be about 10 more minutes .  okay ,  it is a saturday ,  still not bad ,  right ?   finally after waiting one hour and 45 minutes we were finally seated  .   .   .   .  and after numerous people that came in after us were seated .   everywhere on the internet it says red lobster restaurants don ' t take reservations / call ahead seating so my bad for not actually calling to make sure as apparently they now do .   most restaurants won ' t book large parties on a friday or saturday evening or at least keep them to a limited number ,  especially between the 5 pm  -  7 pm rush time because  .   .   .  it ' s a friday or saturday evening and they are already extra busy .   not here  -  there were probably 3 or 4 large parties which i guess was the reason one family of five had to wait almost 2 hours !  !   if they would have just told us upfront that it would be well over an hour wait ,  we would have never stayed .   apparently that is what they tell everyone that walks in because they continually told people that came in after us it would be 45 minutes to an hour wait  ( they did add fifteen more minutes on !  )  .  maybe the hostesses just need more training in figuring out semi - accurate wait times but i recognized them from previous visits and they ' ve all worked there for years .  this would lead you to believe they are just not honest with people in hopes of not turning customers away .   i totally get that it was a saturday and expected to wait but not for almost two hours and not one full hour longer than what you said when we walked in .   that is by far unreasonable .   there were actually smaller parties that came in right after us  ( not call aheads either )  that were seated ,  ate ,  and left before we were seated .   i guess a party between 4 - 8 throws them into a conundrum but they can handle smaller groups and those with over 10 with no problems .   i guess we were really the fools because once we were seated ,  there was hardly anyone left still waiting  ( many had already given up and left )  .   honestly ,  we sat there patiently and only asked once nicely where we were in the wait .   funny how a few people that we are pretty sure came in well after we did ,  but loudly pitched a fit about the wait were seated right after they complained !       now to the food  -  menu selections seem smaller and prices are way too high for the size and quality of the food .   they ' ve really just gone downhill over the years  -  the second biggest reason i won ' t go back .   the food was just average ,  if even that  -  let ' s face it ,  the midwest typically overcooks seafood so it ends up tough and rubbery with little flavor .   the same can be said here .   the only thing that tasted excellent were the cheddar bay biscuits  -  still exceptional !        the only saving grace to the evening was the great waiter .   i don ' t recall his name but he told us he was originally from miami .   he was a very attentive waiter and was very friendly .   if i were only giving stars for his service ,  it would have been 4 or 5 stars for sure !

    "text": "first off the service is absolutely terrible .  the waiter only came over to take our order and bring us our drinks and food .  after that when we needed something we practically had to look around to hunt him down during our entire meal .  he never bothered to come over to check on us to see if we needed drink refills or how our food was .  even when we wanted our check he was no where to be found .   as for the food ;  my sister had ordered the clam chowder and she had to send it back and asked them to reheat it because it wasn ' t even warm ,  it was room tempature .  than between the 5 of us we had ordered other dishes and 20 wings  ( 4 / person )  well there was definitely 20 piece of chicken on the plate ;  if you count the one tiny piece that looks like the very tip of the chicken wing that usually gets thrown out .   when we brought it up to the waiters attention ;  after having to look for him for 15 mins ,  his response was the chefs usually cooks a big batch at a time so they probably miscounted so he ' ll bring us another wing .  we waited another 15 minutes before finally getting his attention to ask for our check and a couple boxes .  so by now we have leftovers all packed up and money in the check sleeve ready for the waiter to take .  i wanted to leave a feedback with the manager on duty there about our meal so i asked a waitress to get the manager for me since our waiter wasn ' t around .  now we are pretty much ready to leave and the one piece of wing never came out ;  that is until our waiter overheard us asking for the manager .  because as soon as the manager got to our table so did the one piece of chicken wing soaked in oil .   when we told the manager about the wings he pretty much brushed it off and laughed in our face and said  \" i guarantee the chefs didn ' t count this as a wing \"  and that  \" they probably just shorted you guys a wing and so someone else here got that extra wing \"  .  it was 20 wings for  $ 20 so his solution was telling us he ' ll take a dollar off our bill if we wanted .   i felt like that was a slap to my face and i felt a little discriminated ,  like if i wasn ' t asian things would ' ve been different .  i wasn ' t looking for any type of discount or freebie ,  all i wanted to do was give a feedback to the manager so he knows they should be more careful since this wasn ' t the first time they  \" miscounted \"   ( in the past i ' ve been shorted on wings and shrimps )  tonight is the last time i ' m ever eating / drinking here and i will no longer be recommending people to come here .

    "text": "one star may seem harsh ,  the food was mediocre at best and the service / restaurant policies are horrendous .   i have eaten here for lunch several times over the years but tonight ' s meal will be my last .  i arrived around 7 pm ,  it ' s a make up your bowl and we cook it concept .  a one time trip to the ingredient bar is  $ 9 while a all - you - can eat option is  $ 13 .  signage at the buffet is small print and no one greets you at the door to explain the  \" rules \"  .   i filled my bowl headed to the register and i said i just wanted one bowl .  the almost impossible to hear cashier / waitress said only the all you can eat option is available after 4pm .  i told her i don ' t want that and she said she ' d give me a box for my second bowl .   $ 14 . 50 with no drink plus they wanted a tip .   after i ate my first bowl ,  i had my second bowl made and had a few bites .  i was ready for my box .  the other almost silent waitress ,  suddenly very audible ,  said i couldn ' t have one it was against policy .  i told her what the other girl said and she told me that was  \" impossible \"  because the girl knew better and had worked there a very long time .  i went to the register to confront the girl who denied she made me that offer .  i told her she lied with my voice raised a bit and the dominant waitress handed me the smallest box possible .  i packed my bowl and left .  ironically ,  i even tipped them ,  a self service restaurant .

    "text": "well we went to tony ' s last nite .  .  sat nite for dinner is busy .   upon entering ,  we noticed that there were several other groups waiting .  we told the unsmiling hostess that we were a party of three .   she told us it would be a 20 minute wait .   we reluctantly gave her our name  &  sat down in the front lobby .   tony roma ' s hadn ' t been our first choice ,  we had been told @ moxies that it was at least a 45 minute wait .  tony ' s is not a  \" reliable \"  restaurant choice we ' ve found ,  they have many problems and this particular evening was no exception !   the restaurant was not packed ,  by any means .  the problem was that there was no one busing tables !  !  !  so there was sat ,  in the lobby ,  as we watched the ridiculous disorganization taking place .   after about 15 minutes of pacing and watching all these tables sit empty while we waited ,  i was getting more and more frustrated with the situation .   finally i said to the stoic hostess ,   \" either find us a table or i ' m going to go clean one myself !  she looked @ me with disinterest  &  said she found us a table .   the 3 of us sat down at a booth in the restaurant side .   my man  &  i ordered the  \" kickin '  shrimp \"  as an appie  ( this is our fav and the only reason we continue to eat here !  )  and decided we ' d split the 14 oz ribeye @ 38 $  a plate .  our guest ordered a double breast chicken dish with spinach .   the shrimp was good and up to our usual expectations .   our main courses arrived shortly there after .   our guest began eating and said ,   \" you know ,  my chicken is burnt i think !  \"  we looked @ it and she turned over one of the breasts to reveal a burnt bottom !  who sends out burnt meat ?  ?  ?   we called the waitress over .  she began to say that she ' d asked them to add this extra piece of chicken cuz it had looked kinda small .  my guest quickly shut her down and said ,   \"  this is burnt and dry as dry can be !  !  !  \"   \" take this back and while ur at it ,  send your manager over here !  \"   now we had finished our shared ribeye  ( which was nothing special @ 38 $   .  .  including the mashed potatoes which tasted like instant !  )  .  my guest was livid .   the manager arrived and was somewhat apologetic .  my guest begins a tirade of complaints and explains to the manager that she  won ' t come here ,  as a general rule ,  becuz the place is always a gong show .  the manager is starting to have trouble maintaining his composure ,  wringing his hands as he tries to calm down my friend .  he tells her that he ' ll be removing the plate from her bill and hopes she ' ll give them another try @ some point .   i take my turn and tell the already irritated manager ,  about his unsmiling hostess and how bad that is for business when u walk into a place and feel unwelcome .  he says he ' ll look into that as well and promptly turns around and makes a bee line for the kitchen .  .  .  he returns momentarily with several  \" to go \"  boxes that my friend had requested .  she ' s done ,  packs up the majority of an unfinished meal and we wait for the bill .   the bill arrives and the only thing removed from our bill is my friend ' s chicken ,  not her shrimp she ' d ordered on top of her chicken or her beverage .   just a suggestion tony roma ' s .  .  when u have an irate customer .  .  remove all the guests meal ,  not just a portion of it !  !  !   after all was said and done ,  tony ' s was a poor excuse for a restaurant last nite and i would tell anyone that this place is one to be avoided in the future .

    "text": "first off let me start by saying this review doesn ' t reflect the taste by any means ,  because the burgers ,  tots and shakes are delicious .  however ,  the service and the care for the customer are much less to be desired .  this afternoon my wife took my two boys  ( 3 and 17 months )  out with a friend ' s family that ' s visiting from out of town .  naturally burger republic was the spot of choice since they wanted some great burgers .  the trip quickly went downhill .  my oldest has a pretty bad gluten allergy so they specifically requested the gluten free bun for his burger and let the waitress know .  when the food came halfway through the bun they noticed that it was eerily similar to the rest of their regular buns .  when they asked the waitress about it she then asked the kitchen staff and then informed my wife that the bun was in fact not gluten free and she was sorry about that .  that to me is unacceptable .  although she apologized ,  nothing else was done after that to make the situation right .  now i have a son who ' s crying because his stomach isn ' t feeling well in between taking trips to the bathroom .  if nothing else a manager should ' ve been notified and / or the meal should ' ve been comped .  luckily my son ' s allergy isn ' t as bad as some have it and he didn ' t have an immediate allergic reaction needing medical attention .  needless to say that supposedly great trip for out of town friends has now turned a days worth of fun activities into a day of back and forth bathroom visits and crying children .  not cool !  needless to say i can ' t in good conscience recommend burger republic any longer .  regardless of the great food ,  if they can ' t pay attention to the customer for something as easy as a gluten free bun request who ' s to say that the next time this happens there won ' t be serious consequences .

    "text": "this was possibly the worst experience i ' ve ever had at any restaurant .    general disappointments :  they were out of orange juice ,  diet coke ,  and to go boxes .  someone waited twenty minutes to order food to go and then overheard the staff tell someone else they were out of to go boxes and couldn ' t accommodate any take out orders .   ( i think all customers would have appreciated knowing upfront that these items and services were unavailable .  )   service disappointments :  while our initial interaction with our waitress was seemingly standard and friendly ,  i can ' t provide any additional positive feedback about her because we barely saw her again . the waiter who brought us our beverages informed us of their lack of diet coke and forgot 2 / 3 waters .  we spent over 35 minutes trying to make eye contact with our waitress to get her attention  -  and although we made eye contact ,  she never came over .   we spent 45 minutes waiting for refills on water and coffee  ( and of course our food )  ,  while other customers who had been seated after us and were simply sitting closer to the kitchen enjoyed their food .  at this point i stood up and walked over towards the kitchen to request refills ,  and a different waitress said she would be right with us .  ten minutes later our waitress came over with refills and said our food shouldn ' t be much longer .    this is now 55 minutes into our breakfast .   ( just to be clear we all ordered eggs and the restaurant was not full .  )  while she was at our table we requested a set of utensils  ( since only 2 / 3 of our party was given a set of utensils when we were seated )  .  in addition we requested salt and ketchup  -  because at this point we had high hopes our food would be arriving soon and our table was not prepared with these items unlike the other tables near us .   finally over an hour after being seated our food arrived with unmelted cheese on the eggs and 2 packets of ketchup for our table of 3 .  when the waitress walked away we took the bottle of ketchup from an empty table nearby and ate our breakfast .    this was a disappointing visit to say the least .  i recommend you do not visit this establishment under any circumstances .

( seriously people ,  this is a liability on your end if the phone breaks or there is privacy issues .  )  and failed to use it .  so charged another person the appetizer in an attempt to hide the fact .  seriously ,  stay away from this one .  usually have a good time at other texas roadhouses .  never going back to this one .

    "text": "deplorable .  this is how i would describe the customer service at the gaylord opryland hotel and convention center .    i will start upon arriving at the facility :  the valet staff should probably wear smiles and act as if we as guests are not an inconvenience .  after all ,  this is there job .  easily dismissed though as everyone can have a less than great day .  it was also 1 : 00am local time .    upon entering the hotel  ( i refuse to refer to it as a resort which i ' ll explain later )  i was awestruck by the beauty of the lobby and the gardens at the opposite end .  this is of course where the pleasurable experience stopped ,  abruptly .  upon check in we were rudely greeted by a gentleman telling me my room rate was incorrect and it would be  $ 100 higher than my reservation .  despite it being late ,  i calmly asked why the discrepancy ?  he couldn ' t advise me of a straight answer and of course no management staff was available .  i had asked for other facilities in the area to which i was informed they were all booked .  i ' m curious as to know how he knew such a thing !  reluctantly ,  i checked in and was immediately billed  $ 100 more per night for 3 nights ,  3 days worth of parking at  $ 23 / day and an  $ 18 / day resort fee .  surprise !  !  i didn ' t have a choice in the matter because they hit my card with all of it right then and there .  i advised him i would be speaking with a manager the following morning .  surprise again !  no manager was available all 3 days !    i left the front desk to find our room .  and it was the worst hunt i had ever been on in my life .  it took 30 minutes to find the room and the little river that runs through the atrium smelled something horrible .  after wandering through the jungle we emerged in the delta region .  i think that is somewhere in south africa ,  but i ' m unsure .  onto the next adventure !  we were told 1 room number but our keys said another .  since i was advised verbally ,  we chose that one .  keys didn ' t work .  tried the one on the card and voil\u00e0 ,  the doors opened :  to a horribly small room with 2 double beds which had a peculiar odor to it .  now for the luggage .  we used the  \" consider it done \"  button on the phone  ( which by the way i believe it said consider it done our way ,  but i could be mistaken )  .  the bellhop brought the luggage 25 minutes later .  i think he got lost too .  it ' s now 2 : 00am and time to hit the hay and see nashville !    at 8 : 30am someone is brutally banging on our door .  by the nature of the banging i would have thought it to be the feds !  apparently housekeeping doesn ' t pay attention to the little guitar shaped  \" do not disturb \"  card .  i ' m awake now .  .  . and i want coffee !  the coffee maker doesn ' t work .  the iron didn ' t work .  ok .  there ' s a cafe somewhere amongst the foliage !  i saw it marked on the map .  they should probably include a legend on said map .   $ 8 for an overpriced knockoff starbucks ,  but ok ,  it ' s nashville and a local tourist trap .    i ' m going to fast - forward a little as to not make this much longer .  despite the pools not being open when they say they are ,  the restaurants being more expensive than those in airports and with mediocre food at best ,  being kicked out of the pizza place they had inside 10 minutes before closing and our room had an amazing view of dumpsters with the glorious rolling landscape of a parking lot ,  it was a nice place !  the only saving grace were the gardens themselves .  but you can view them without having to pay for a room !    now for the really fun part :  contacting marriott customer care about the horrible visit .   ( the hotel won ' t call you back otherwise .  )  customer care advised me they would forward my grievance to the hotel and i should expect a response in 3 - 5 business days .  i forwarded everything i could think of including my original reservation ,  costs ,  incorrect information and of course the issues we had while staying there .    i was eventually contacted by a heather gates who is the assistant front end manager .  she informed me she was sorry for the way we were treated but they would not do anything to rectify the bill .  that ' s the way it was .  i contacted marriott customer care again and copied heather on this email .  i was then phoned by john bennefield ,  the front end manager who informed me the exact same thing as heather  \" sorry ,  but you ' re stuck with that bill .  \"  furthermore he refused to give me the hotel manager ' s name ,  phone or email .  instead i was informed of his 15 years with the company and this was his 8th hotel !  from working in a large company ,  when someone was transferred so frequently ,  we called it  \" passing the trash \"  .  it definitely wasn ' t due to pride of service .  john was exceptionally rude and went on to belittle me for making such a huge deal and contacting customer care over a mere  $ 300 .  to me ,  that ' s reasonably substantial .  i was also informed directly that  \" the marriott considers this matter closed .  it ends here and there ' s nothing more anyone will do .  \"  i had asked for the hotel managers number ,  name or email to which he told me  \" you can find it online \"  .

( should be  $ 4 .  )   instead of giving him his change back ,  they tell him it is  $ 20  -   $ 16 for the platter and  $ 4 for the side .    ( sudden price increase ?  !  ?  !  )   my friend argues with them briefly and tells him that isn ' t what they agreed to before and he just wants the change .   the guy refuses so my friend leaves ,  having paid an extra  $ 4 .   bottom line :  don ' t eat here !   they ' re dishonest and completely rude .   oh ,  and on top of that ,  the food was bland .   spent  $ 20 for bland food .   shame .    ( no ,  my opinion about the food wasn ' t biased by his experience .   he told me after we ate so i would still enjoy my food and not go out and tear them a new one .  ) ",

    "text": "i was excited to try this restaurant .  i was in from los angeles visiting family and yelp had such great things to say .  then i asked to use the restroom .    i poked my head in the kitchen and asked the brothers where it was .  the chef brother told me i was interrupting him and his brother and that the only place i was allowed to talk to my server was on the floor .  i thought he was kidding and the server brother sent me to the restroom .    i came back from the restroom and the chef brother stopped me as i passed the kitchen to tell me that i was never allowed to come near his kitchen and that i needed to get the hell out of his restaurant .  i told him i would be happy to leave since he was obviously insane .    the server brother came back to ask to the kitchen to investigate why the chef brother was yelling at a customer .  as we left i heard the brothers going at it again .    the service was terrible .  because the brothers were having a bad day it was literally impossible for our table to complete placing an order without our server walking away while someone was speaking .  we waited at least 15 minutes to place an order while watching the brothers argue in the door to the kitchen .    the food we got ,  bread and either whipped butter in a dish of oil ,  was revolting .  primarily because none of us could figure out if it was whipped butter or some sort of soft cheese .    it ' s obvious this is not the first time there two have had these kinds of arguments in their restaurant with customers present based on how easily they engaged in their unprofessional behavior .  it ' s also obvious by how the chef brother treated me that i am not the first customer he has blown up at for no reason .    the relationship between these brothers and their inability to maintain professionalism is going to bring this restaurant down .  you simply can ' t treat customers ,  or co - workers ,  the way they treat them .

    "text": "so i was really excited to try this place ,  and before i start this review let me acknowledge that yes ,  i do realize that we chose to try this place out for the 1st tim on  cinco de mayo ,  and i probably could expect slower than usual service at a mexican restaurant ,  but i also might counter that with it being cinco de mayo ,  that a popular mexican restaurant should know enough to have proper staffing .  and let me also point out ,  that of all of the many mexican restaurants in the fountain square area ,  they were by far the least crowded that night .    okay so with that out - of - the - way ,  my wife and i walked in ,  walked through the front area ,  through the middle bar ,  to the back outdoor tiki bar area .  and while it was crowded ,  as i would ' ve expected it would be ,  there was no standing room only ,  or people waiting for tables ,  in fact we found an empty table almost immediately .   we were encouraged ,  but we probably should have listened to the couple next to us who told us they sure hope we weren ' t planning on eating there ,  because they had been there for an hour and were still waiting on their food .   we were approached almost immedietly by a server who took our drink orders .   that had to be a good sign ,  right !   well ,  our drinks took about 20 mins .  . ok so it ' s cinco de mayo ,  no big deal .   we figured we had better get our food order in .   pretty simple order ,  chips and questo ,  and two tacos each .   nothing special .   after about 45 mins and no sign of even our chips ,  i walked up to bar in front area and ordered chips and queso and 2 more drinks .   he got that all for me in about 5 mins .   i asked him if i could order a couple of tacos and he told me the kitchen was closed .   i told him we placed our order about 45 mins ago and he assured me we would get our food and it was only  closed for new orders .   took our drinks and chips and queso back outside to tiki bar and relaxed for a while .     another 45 mins later and still no food .   we grabbed our waitress and she said she would check .   she came back about 30 mins later and informed us that our order was the last one the kitchen had accepted but they dropped our ticket on the floor and never made our tacos and were now out of everything .   two hours and no food .   we asked to speak to manager but he / she was not available .   to cap it all off she still charged us for the two drinks we had ordered almost 2 hours ago .   i see that this place is highly reviewed by most for the food ,  but i doubt we will go back ,  and if they dont fix their service and management issues ,  i doubt this place will be around for very long !

    "text": "heed the warnings .  long lines ,  poor service ,  horrible food .  i ' m sorry ,  but everything we were served was just nasty .  we had a 3 hour layover and i neglected to look at the reviews prior to us getting a table .   we passed by several tables on our way to our seats and everyone ' s food looked straight nasty .  but we stuck it out and went on and ordered anyway .  we started with some cheese sticks .  these were so gross .  when they arrived on our table ,  they were soaked with some kind of weird brown juice .  i assume it was the oil they were fried in that looked like it was last changed prior to the exxon - valdez oil spill back in  ' 89 .  horrible ,  burnt ,  greasy ,  and very  \" off \"  flavor .  our table mate next to us ordered the ravioli bites ,  they were also covered in the brown oil grease and they didn ' t even eat 1 / 2 of them .   our pasta dishes were equally as disappointing and gross .  i opted for the lasagna ,  and it was nasty .  the pasta itself was overcooked ,  which i can live with if bolstered by a decent sauce ,  quality / fresh meat ,  and good cheese .  this lasagna offered none of these things .  the sauce was the worst offender .  packed with sugar ,  it was a very sweet ,  very thin red / marinara sauce .  there were no spices or typical italian seasonings ,  no garlic ,  no onion flavor ,  none of the deep ,  rich flavors that typically adorn good italian - style food .  the cheese was cheap and rubbery ,  and there was no meat in the lasagna to speak of .  literally ,  i had none in my dish .  it was absent ,  and sorely needed .   do not eat here .  you will regret it .

    "text": "my husband and i stopped here for lunch on a saturday afternoon around 2 - ish .   the restaurant was completely empty .   we inquired if they were even open and a nice lady said they were and proceeded to seat us .    their menu did not offer as many options of meat types or dishes as most mexican restaurants do here in indianapolis .   my husband ordered a margarita and the special of the day ,  chilaquilles con salsa verde y pollo at  $ 6 . 99 and i ordered a carne asada burrito at  $ 7 . 99 and water to drink .  chips and salsa were brought to the table .   chips were  fried there ,  and while i like that style of chip  ( thin ,  often bubbles into thin layers )  but were cold and very greasy .   salsa was sweet but had some heat in the finish .   it was easy to eat a lot of those !  when our meals came to the table ,  frankly ,  they were underwhelming .   my burrito tortilla looked / felt like it was not heated at all and cutting into my burrito was disappointing .   there was lots of lettuce and tomato ,  a scoop of a white rice  ( not spanish rice )  and there was supposed to be mozzarella cheese in it but couldn ' t taste or see it .   the carne asada was thinner than a strip of bacon .   unfortunately ,  i would be generous in saying there was maybe 2 ounces of beef .   in all honesty ,  there was no more meat in it than two strips of bacon ,  diced .   my husband mentioned it to the person  ( owner )  with a quick  \" sorry \"  muttered and no offer to do anything .    while the combination of ingredients was not improperly prepared ,  there are 100 other mexican restaurants in town i can spend  $ 8 . 00 on a burrito and it would be generously filled with meat .  as for my husband ' s chilaquilles ,  i order this all the time from biscuits in broad ripple and this was another disappointment .   this was chips ,  salsa verde ,  one fried egg and a very thin boneless piece of grilled chicken .   my husband felt as i did .   not poorly prepared but completely lacking any substance .   during the time we spent in this restaurant ,  there was not one other customer coming or going .   with the lack of substance to the food ,  i suspect most people will feel as i did and would not waste their time coming back here .   there is no way this restaurant can survive when prices are the same as other mexican restaurants but quality is far less .   sadly ,  i was even mad that we spent  $ 25 . 00 at this place and left just to drive to a fast food restaurant so we could get some quick ,  cheap protein .    i will chalk this up to a learning experience .   folks ,  save your money and go to rosita ' s or margaritas u . s .  31 ,  leonardo ' s or even el meson .

    "text": "they used to make an amiga bowl that had an abundance of shredded grilled chicken on the bottom of a flour tortilla bowl ,  a layer of rice topped with grilled onions and peppers with a queso sauce drizzeled over the top .  tonight there was no rice nor any shredded chicken ,  it had been replaced with chicken crisps .  they are the outer parts of a grilled chicken breast with no moisture and very few of them .  having met the owner in the past and having his wife wait on me i knew something wasn ' t right .  i explained to the waitress that this dish had changed and wasn ' t good !  she politely offered something else .  what to order .  .  . if they had modified a basic dish what was next ?  to my surprise a male manager came out and  \" informed \"  me that this is exactly what they had been serving for 10 years and i must have either special ordered something or was mistaken .  i said this is not what they had served me for the past 5 years and i never had requested a special order before .   i also asked what they had done to the phenominal soft tacos ?  they were usually served in a soft warm flour tortilla and had moisture and flavor .  tonight they were stale and crisp and the filing was bland .   again he informed me i was mistaken while he held my order that had been sent back to the kitchen in front of me .  i apologized and said i didn ' t wish for anything else ,  thank you .  another manager came out a few moments later apologizing and stated that they are unfamiliar with what i had ordered and would  \" special order \"  anything i wanted .  i declined .  apparently their cook walked out tonight and they were winging it .  too bad it was a good place to get a good mexican meal .  two thumbs down on poblano ' s .

    "text": "stay away .  my husband and i stopped here this afternoon to use a gift card given to us a long time ago .  we do not normally buy cold stone ice cream ,  and we ' re pretty easy to please .  all we were looking for was a nice cold treat on a hot day -  what we got was a small ice cream that was way too sweet  ( yes ,  even for ice cream !  )  ,  and a chocolate shake that was not good ,  for about  $ 11 .  my husband took one sip of his shake and pushed it away .  i took a taste and agreed that something was not right .  it had a distinctly sour ,  bitter aftertaste .  while i finished my ice cream ,  he debated about whether he wanted something else instead .  since the ingredients seemed to be the problem ,  he decided did not want something else ,  even though my ice cream seemed fine .  when i took the shake back to the register and explained the problem ,  we were told we could not receive a refund ,  only a replacement .  both of us had an upset stomach for about two hours afterwards ,  and neither of us had more than a sip or two .  poor customer service ,  bad ingredients .  food poisoning is not worth  $ 11 ,  so we simply left .   poor customer service is my biggest pet peeve -  as someone who has worked in customer service and international sales for four years ,  i promise you -  it ' s really not that difficult of a task to make sure your customer is happy ,  even if there is a language / geographical barrier  ( today ,  there was neither )  .  while i realize that the employee i spoke to is probably a minimum wage high school student ,  store policies that young woman has to follow are set by real adults .  whoever set the policies for this store clearly is not doing their job !   shame on you ,  coldstone ,  for trying to give my  ( active - duty  &  a veteran )  husband food poisoning on memorial day ,  and refusing to make any real attempt to make amends .  don ' t worry ,  you sure as hell won ' t see us again ,  ever .  fool me once .  .  .  .

( paraphrasing )  .  the bartender says  \" sure !  \"  and proceed to service this group ,  one - by - one ,  as they order drinks .  ok ,  fine technically ,  i was looking at the menu when this started .  but still ,  he walked back and forth ,  right in front of me ,  for about 10 - 12 minutes .  not once did he say ,   \" hey ,  just shout and i will get you something \"  ,  or  \" hey man ,  just give me a few minutes and i will be right with you \"  .  nothing !   it was obvious it was a big group ,  but i mean ,  he gave no acknowledgement to the fact that i was sitting there waiting !    long story short  -  after this 10 - 12 minutes of waiting ,  i just walked out and went somewhere else .  now this place has about 4\\5 stars with around 500 reviews .  so ,  i guess people like it .  but their bartenders are as unfriendly as i have ever encountered .   maybe if you get a table it ' s different .

( last year i was racially profiled .  the waitress would not let us in and asked me if i was able to pay the restaurant minimum .  her attitude changed immediately after my chinese husband showed up .  )  i let the first incident slide but this one sent me through the roof .  i just helped my friend ' s family plan a 40th birthday party for her and the night manager was one of the rudest people i ' ve ever met .  let me preface that my husband and his family know him from many years of working in chinatown and we ' ve always helped support his business .  to make a long story short :  i booked a birthday party for 7 : 00 .  the family came early to set up ,  as he said it was allowed .  at 6 : 30 he came in yelling that we have to leave at 9 : 00 because he has someone coming in and we can ' t stay there all night .  i reminded him that we have a 7 : 00 reservation and that we spoke several times to confirm and he said  \" so what i don ' t care ,  it doesn ' t matter be out by 9 .  \"  he was yelling at me across the restaurant .  he was so unprofessional and hurtful ,  especially since we ' ve always supported this business .  at 8 : 55 he came in and said we could stay longer ,  but i couldn ' t even look at him and everyone was ready to leave anyway .  his verbal abuse practically ruined my night .  i love the food and the karaoke room ,  but tonight was my last visit there .  i strongly recommend another restaurant .  there are so many other restaurants that will give you the chinatown experience and not treat you and your guests like crap .  so ,  so ,  disappointed !

    "text": "i am an ex - server for olive garden .  it is one of my favorite restaurants and i drove over half an hour to eat there with two of my friends on thursday may 31st .  our servers were tracey and mikayla ,  whose was training ,  and i was extremely disappointed in the service that we recieved .  i ' d like to highlight first the some service that met the outstanding expectations that i know olive garden expects .  when we arrived we were seated right away and our server in training introduced herself fairly quickly .  we were given adequate time to look at the menu and make our selections .  our first round of salad and bread sticks ,  along with our appetizer very quickly .  after this though the whole atmosphere and attitude seemed to change .  our tray of breadsticks and salad stood empty for almost 20 minutes after that initial  round .  one of the reasons i love olive garden is because of the refills on salad ,  soup ,  and breadsticks .  while we waited on someone to recognize that we needed refills ,  a tray of dirty dishes sat out in the dining room for approximately 30 minutes across from our table .  our main courses came out before our second round of salad and breadsticks and when i recieved my entree the sauce in the ravioli de portabellas that i had ordered congealed and the entree was cold .  i flagged down a server as no one had asked us how are meal was .  although my meal was replaced with no question ,  it came out after both of my friends were finished eating and had recieved to - go boxes ,  so i was eating my meal alone .  after we were all done eating ,  everything was boxed up ,  and dishes were cleared we then waited over another 15 minutes for my dessert to - go and our check .  finally when we did receive our check it was the wrong one .  thankfully i was planning on paying with a credit card so i didn ' t just leave money on the table and walk out .   again i am very disappointed in the service i recieved tonight .  the problem with our service is that there was no direction from the server that was training the new employee .  tracey seemed to be more worried about a large party that was sitting behind us but made a point to mention in passing that mikayla better do good tonight because she was making her money .  now i understand the basis behind why trainees give their tips to their trainer ,  as i went through the training myself ,  but tracy was not guiding her ,  checking on the table or shadowing her anyway .  i feel like mikayla was sent out to the wolves with no food .

'  ,  and i was laughed at .   when i informed her that it wasn ' t funny ,  i was told that the discount would be applied .     here comes the food .   it was good ;  it tasted good ,  it was priced - well ,  and the order was accurate .   i noticed 2 things  -  about 5 feet away from me ,  a waitress was very clearly picking her nose .   also ,  she had a finger in her mouth for no less than 45 seconds .   the ambiance seemed like a practical joke .   authentic music was supplied via tinny pa speakers that had a source supplied from a laptop playing youtube videos .   the televisions were strangely lined with a thick layer of saran wrap .   all - in - all ,  i ' d avoid this place in the future .

    "text": "a few years back my wife and i went here for lunch .   it ' s clearly a bar first and foremost so it was mostly empty when we were there .   i guess some people start drinking early ,  but not that many this particular day .   we had never been before but were close by and craved burgers and chicken tenders so we gave it a shot .   again it ' s primarily a bar so don ' t expect it to be a place for a relaxing quiet meal for two .   nothing wrong with that ,  especially if you ' re there to watch a game .   i ordered a burger and my wife got chicken tenders .   we got our ketchup and all that situated and started eating .   my wife took a bite of her chicken and immediately received a burn in her mouth .  the tender had a pocket of hot grease in it so when she took a bite ,  the grease spurted out onto the roof of her mouth .   it was so bad it burned off the skin and started bleeding .   she got some ice from her pop to help ease the pain ,  but that didn ' t do much .   i got our server ' s attention and told her that my wife burned her mouth .   she replied ,   \" well ,  they just came out of the fryer \"  and walked off .   we ended up leaving with to - go boxes .   the next day my wife went to the doctor as the burn was still bleeding and painful .   we were angry so we notified the corporate office .   a week or so later we got an apology letter and a  $ 20 gift card .   the person who sent the letter said he spoke to the manager at that location and instructed him to have a meeting with his staff about this incident .   as my wife mentioned in her note to the company ,  it ' s common practice for servers to tell patrons when their food has just come out of the oven or fryer and to be careful because it is very hot .   but the issue is really about the server ' s attitude .   we wouldn ' t have written corporate if the server had been concerned about my wife ' s burn .   we used our gift card to order something for carry out and brought it home .   we figured this would let it cool down .   but we ' ve not been back since .   i believe the corporate manager was sincere in what he wrote and am glad he was having the store manager meet with his employees .   however ,  he should have offered to pay the bill for the doctor ' s visit .   hopefully this hasn ' t happened to someone else .

    "text": "the next morning we were up early ,  filled with expectations of the new adventures in new orleans .  we decided to walk to have breakfast in surrey ,  which we found on yelp .  it was a highly recommended local breakfast place .  located far from the touristy french quarters ,  it ' s a small shack - dive beloved by locals and tourists as the best in local cuisine .  even before we got there ,  we saw a crowd of people waiting outside .  the wait for a table was 30 minutes so we felt lucky and elated to sit at the bar .  we got a watermelon and jicama salad and a crabmeat omelet .  i was disappointment from the first bite .  the omelet was soooo rich ,  like it was made with cream and butter and more butter - cream on top ;  it made me nauseous .  the salad was so plain ,  it felt like a joke ,  a few pieces of watermelon on ripped up leaves of bibb lettuce  covered with black pepper .  i needed to eat something and asked for a garden salad with a poached egg .  it was a poor showing with some mixed greens ,  a pathetically thin slice of tomato ,  a few cubes of huge cucumbers used for juicing and a balsamic vinaigrette mixed by finger right in front of me .  the place is a tiny shack ,  should be filled with lovingly prepared local cuisine .  it is not .  the food ,  as well as the service and the ambiance are a poor showing ,  more hype than substance .  the supposedly organic fresh juices ,  at  $ 7 a pop ,  are not squeezed to order but poured from containers from the fridge .  freshly squeezed should be freshly squeezed .  they refused to give us water with ice .  how can you not give people water when its so unbearable hot outside ?  we paid more for our breakfast than a top french restaurant in new york and i walked away hungry and disgusted .

    "text": "i normally love bailey ' s range ,  but tonight was extremely disappointing .  our server seemed really nice at first to our table of four ,  but as the night went on ,  we saw her paying more attention to the table of four behind us .  she was attentive to them ,  and checking in on them regularly .  at one point we were out of water .  someone else had stopped to bring us more water .  we had to flag down our server to get another drink for my friend ,  but she left so quickly after that ,  that we were not able to order for the rest of the table .  while we waited ,  we noticed the table on the other side of us got all of their food .  .  . they were seated about 20 minutes after us .  our server could not be found for awhile ,  so my friend got the attention of another worker to see if she could check in on our order .  .  . this was over an hour after we were seated .  we were seated at 7 : 33 ,  but did not get our food until 8 : 45 .  she did not ask if we needed anything else .  our server never checked in and asked us how our food was .  she never apologized that it was busy and that our food took so long .  she did ask the four guys behind us many times ,  and i even heard her say they were getting 16 oz beers for the price of a 9 oz .  wow .  .  . how did they get that deal ?  one of my friends was getting tired ,  so we decided to ask for the check shortly after we ate our burgers .  our server flew right past our table to the table behind us to ask if they needed anything ,  then she started to walk away .  my friend yelled her name 3 times to get her to come back so we could ask for the check .  still no apologies ,  no asking how our food or experience was .  personally ,  i was ready to walk out .  but my friends were kind and still left a tip and did not make a ruckus .  i completely understand that you folks were slammed with the halloween convention in town ,  but it ' s no excuse for poor customer service ,  especially to those that live downtown and frequent your restaurant and recommend it to others .  it ' s going to take me a long time to go back ,  if i ever do .  i certainly will not be recommending it anytime soon .  sad and disappointed on many levels .

    "text": "probably one of the worst experiences i ' ve had in a restaurant  :  (  let me just start off saying ,  the food is good !  nothing wrong with any of the food ,  the chefs are amazing and we all enjoyed our food .  the problem was with the service .  .  .  .   we made a reservation for 9 at 7 : 15 and we ended up getting their around 6 : 45 .  we were told we needed to wait because there wasn ' t enough chefs ,  which is totally fine and understandable .  then the woman at the front seats a party of 2 and another party of 3 .  so i asked why they were able to sit down before our group  ( and by this time it was about 7 - 7 : 10 )  and she told me because they had a smaller group .  .  .  .  okay well if we had a reservation wouldn ' t we be first to sit down ?  we didn ' t care if the chef wasn ' t ready we just wanted to sit down order drinks and have some appetizers .  we were then seated and our server ivan came over very promptly which was nice .  after he got our first round of drinks this is where things went down hill .    we ordered some sushi ,  simple sushi .  salmon ,  and shrimp .  we ordered 2 rolls ,  a crunch roll and a shrimp tempura roll .  he brought out yellowtail ,  tuna and 2 veggie rolls .  i kindly said that the food wasn ' t ours and that wasn ' t what we ordered .  he told me that it was and that i was wrong .  so i asked to see the sushi paper because maybe i marked the wrong thing .  and then he said he threw the paper away but he took the sushi away with a huge attitude and said he would go try and find the paper .  well our group could see him in the back area and he pulled the paper out of his apron and came over and said oh yeah i guess it was my fault i brought you guys the wrong stuff .  .  .  .  okay that ' s what we tried explaining !  the stuff finally comes out and tasted perfect !  so then some of us ordered the teppan and we got our miso soup and then once that was done we got our salad .  none of us had forks and i ' m pretty sure maybe 1 out the 9 of us knew how to use chopsticks so i asked for forks and he said yeah no problem .  well we waited out 10 minutes until we saw him again and couldn ' t find any other servers to ask for their help so we ended up just eating with our fingers .  we finally see ivan and asked for forks again and he said ,   \" do you honestly need them right now ?  your food isn ' t being cooked !  \"  excuse me !  i was so furious that he would even come back with such attitude .  all of the girls needed forks and so we told him ,  yes we need them now .  i almost got up to go find them myself !  anyways ,  chef comes ,  food turned out good and no ivan to be found for about 30 minutes .  so 2 girls in our group asked for boxes ,  myself included ,  and it took him about 15 minutes to get them so i ended up eating the last bit of food i was going to take home .  so when he brought my box i said ,   \" i ' m sorry ,  i don ' t need the box anymore i finished what i was going to take home ,  but thank you !  \"   ( very politely )  he then came back with  \" ok well maybe if i take your plate away you ' ll stop changing your mind \"  what in the hell !  !  !  !  at this point i was done trying to be nice .  after2 and half hours i was so glad to be leaving !  ivan was so rude to all of the girls in our group !  i hope if we go back ,  which we probably won ' t ,  that ivan will not be there .  i always try and give people the benefit of the doubt and maybe he was having a bad day ,  but if your day is that bad ,  don ' t come into work and be mean and rude to your customers .  i work with the public and believe me ,  it ' s hard to always please everyone .  but it ' s unacceptable to be rude to people !  !

    "text": "went to kings garden for my birthday dinner ,  let me say that i don ' t think i will ever go back there again .   when we first walked in i noticed only one family eating in the restaurant .  anyway we decided to order seafood delight with brown rice ,  vegetable lo mien and a half peking duck with sticky buns .   first of all seafood delight was served on a sizzling skillet which cooled down quickly .  also ,  it was served with a small portion of brown rice .  maybe its my fault i should have known it was an individual portion and not served family style .   the lo mien was ok but again it was a small portion .   all of this would have been ok but the peking duck was the worst .  i was really looking forward to the sticky buns and to my surprise when the duck came out it was served with cold flour tortillas !  when we finished my mom was still hungry and wanted to order more food  ( we are not really big eaters )  .   one saying grace were the fortune cookies that we enjoyed with our hot tea .   when we left the only people eating in the restaurant was the family that owns the restaurant .   i should have gone with my mom first instinct to have fish and chips for my birthday dinner at mcmenamins .

( which she should of brought when she gave us the boxes )  .    ( strike three )    *  * oh did i mention that it wasn ' t crowded ?   so there was no need for the poor customer service .    bottom line  -  -  the food here is great ,   but the customer service sucks ass big time .   the waitress we had was very lazy ,  unprofessional ,  and act like she was intimidated by us .   my company does a lot of business with sports bars in philadelphia and because of last night i will have them reconsider their relationship with chickie and petes .   i will take great customer service with mediocre food any day  -  -  over poor customer service and great food .  .

( or maybe fries were over - cooked and dry from sitting under the warmer for 5 minutes as i stared at it .  )  turkey blt was subpar and the kids chicken fingers were over - cooked too .    i ' m surprised the server came by later and asked how our meals were  ( albeit robotic )  but not surprised that when we said i got the wrong cheese ,  she said  \" sorry \"  without any suggestions or offers to make good on her mistake .    we were ready to pay and eager to leave .  .  . we waved down another server who said she couldn ' t take our payment as our assigned server had to do it .  we said  \" can you let her know ?  \"  and she said  \" i can ' t ,  she ' s with another table \"  and walked away .  we were in disbelief that this experience just got worse .    the only good memorable moment was when i said under my breath  \" this place is terrible ,  \"  and my young son repeated me .    advice :  hire people who are actually friendly or shut it down .  this is an embarrassment .  will never go there again and probably never go to another friendly ' s ever .

    "text": "wow !   i just wrote a scathing review about el patron pizza in tampa for leaving unwanted and unwelcome fliers under the door of unsuspecting tourist here in tampa .   i was going to use a lot of the same issues for this review of new york pizza grill ,  but now i ' m not sure what to say ,  only to say it carefully .   i knew there was something not quite right about the greasy looking punk that was meandering in the hallway of the 4 star hotel where i am currently residing .   as soon as i saw the flier i grabbed my room key and went looking for this person .   in hindsight that was not smart ,  as soon as i got a look at the guy ,  i ran for the elevator .   now ,  i am no shrinking violet ,  but this guy looked like he ' s slap his own mother .   after reading the other reviews on here ,  i guess i should be happy that this employee didn ' t turn around and attack !   my biggest issue with this business is that they litter the halls and rooms with these fliers .   they sneak into hotels ,  a place where you feel safe and after this ,  i don ' t .   it doesn ' t seem to matter where it is a 5 star hotel chain or a family run business .   i did call every one of the pizza place that do this ,  because i felt bad about complaining to the staff at the hotel ,  but after yesterdays run in with greasy guy for new york pizza grill ,  i had it .   i do not feel safe and i told management that ,  and the did call the police .   so ,  for the employee of new york pizza grill ,  if you get caught stuffing fliers under doors where you are not invited and do not belong ,  you are more than likely going to be arrested .   so when you are out and about making not enough to keep your car running ,  ask yourself if your boss will bail you out of jail .   i doubt it ,  they ' ll probably just get another less than intelligent person to litter ,  trespass ,  annoy and sometimes terrify ,  hotel staff and their guests .   there are numerous reasons not to eat at new york pizza grill ,  but i ' m just tossing out a good reason not to work for them .

    "text": "i want to start off with the fact that i ' ve been here multiple times .  the first time ,  everything was great ,  it was around lunch ,  the service was fantastic ,  the food was fantastic and i decided to make it my go to diner .  the second time i brought my mother and she ordered a cheese quesadilla ,  when it came out it was just slices of cheese ontop of a folded tortilla ,  we spoke to the manager about it who told us we were wrong about wanting to order something different .  so today i decided to give this place one last chance .  came in with my boyfriend and kids .  we ordered two reuben ' s .  one pastrami ,  one corn beef and we split them as we always have .  the kids ordered typical kids meals .  when our food came out the rye was completely under toasted and the fries were not well done .  as a server myself i know that the cooks don ' t always listen to what the ticket said .  one of the kids meals was completely over cooked ,  and the other was under cooked !   ( roasted turkey under cooked ,  chicken fingers over cooked )  the manager / host came up to the stand  ( which was directly behind us )  and started coughing very loudly .  i turned around to make sure he was ok and he ' s facing my table and coughing without covering his mouth !  at that point i had enough !  i politely asked our waitress for a box  &  the check .  when i went up to pay the same manager / host was there to cash me out ,  didn ' t even ask how everything was just grabbed the money out of my hand !  the entire time i was there the manager / host was yelling at the busser about cleaning tables ;  from what i saw the busser moved very quickly and there was only one busser from what i saw so yelling at him was uncalled for especially in front of guests !  he also yelled across the restaurant several times for  \" ashley \"  to come get a beer for another server ,  instead of just walking his lazy a *  *  the 5 feet to the table it needed to go to !  and last but not least ,  the manager gave me and the kids a dirty look and scoffed when one of the children asked if he could go give our server her tip ,  which is completely uncalled for and unprofessional !  i told him yes but he needed to wait until she was done at the table ,  which he did .  he then waited for her by our table and handed her the tip and smiled .  she was very polite to all 4 of us and addressed any and all concerns we had !  i ' d suggest my server find a job elsewhere ,  she was absolutely fantastic and the only reason i ' m even giving 1 star !  i will never be back unless the management changes !  !  !  !  !  i have been a server for over 10 years now so i know what is expected out of servers ,  bussers  &  management and this manager was by far one of the worst i ' ve ever seen in any restaurant !  so to the lovely server with the bandana headband ;  get out while you still can !  you ' re a great server and plenty of restaurants would be lucky to have you as a part of their company !

    "text": "disappointing experience .  pastries  ( had the croissant ,  eclair ,  cannoli )  are okay but nothing amazing .  dining area is small .  very limited drink options .  i agree with previous reviews that it is very reminiscent of break - room coffee with 2 pump pots full of coffee and buy - in - bulk tea bags .     really what soured the experience was the counter staff .   after my so and i purchased several pastries ,  coffee ,  tea and went to sit down ,  the staff informed us that we couldn ' t stay because they were closing .  the sign says 5pm ,  this was at 4pm .   she assured us that it was just that day they were closing early .    no apology .  just informed us and walked away .  after all this ,  i had to remind her that i was still waiting for a cup of hot water to steep my warehouse earl grey tea in .  we came to the cafe to sit and enjoy tea and pastries so it was obviously a disappointment to get kicked out before the advertised closing time .   i would have greatly appreciated being informed of the earlier hours prior to making a purchase or at least in the form of a sign .  would much rather enjoy a pre - made croissant and better drink options at the adjacent starbucks or pjs .  lesson learned .

( we did let our server know we were headed to the movies after dinner ,  there was only 5 of us )  this was extremely disappointing ,  even though they offered is boxes to take with us .  .  . which honestly ,  we couldn ' t even do since we would be at a movie for a few hours .     we expressed our disappointment to the  \" manager ,  \"  who never even looked up ,  made eye contact ,  or engaged in a conversation when we shared with her our experience .  all she said was  \" i gave you a little something off \"  -  which was  $ 1 . 50 off the entire check .  it wasn ' t even the discount that irked me -  we were looking for someone to validate and at least pretend they were concerned about our experience ,  and even that was too difficult to do .    i would just eat at the theater or head to red robbins if you ' re looking for a quick bite to eat .  apparently ,  the fry times for friendlies chicken fingers ,  fries ,  etc exceed over 20 minutes .

    "text": "one word to describe this place  -  awful .  i ordered take out from here a few weeks ago .  it was a sunday night ,  around 7 o ' clock .  they told me to pick it up in 30 minutes  ( i ordered a grilled chicken sandwich with lettuce and tomato and maria ' s sandwich which consists of prosciutto ,  mozzarella ,  and tomato )  .  i thought 30 minutes was a little excessive but figured they were probably busy with dinner service .  so i arrive to pick up my food about 35 - 40 minutes later .  not one car in the parking lot ,  not one person in the restaurant area and i ' m told my food is still not ready .  i ended up waiting an additional 15 minutes for a piece of grilled chicken and a cold sandwich .  the grilled chicken should not take too long on the grill and the other sandwich didn ' t even require cooking !  !  the girl at the front desk was not apologetic at all .  the cook came out 3 times to talk / flirt with the girls at the front desk .  all around it was very unprofessional .    so i get home to try my sandwich and was not pleased at all .  the grilled chicken sandwich was literally a piece of flavorless chicken served on a hamburger bun .  yes ,  a hamburger bun .  the other sandwich was not for me but i had to try it .  again ,  flavorless .  i will not be going back here ever again .  for the record ,  this was probably my 3rd or 4th time ordering from here only due to the fact that it ' s right down the street from me ,  and every time i ' ve had to wait a long time for food and / or the food was not good .  i ' ve eaten at the other location in conshohocken before and have been pleased but this location is horrible .  save your time and order elsewhere .

    "text": "do not eat here .  my husband ,  two friends and i went out for restaurant week to marmont steakhouse on saturday ,  january 26 ,  2013 ;  our experience was horrific .   the four of us ordered the crab bisque soup for our first course ,  it was cold and we sent it back to be reheated .   my second course was the calamari it was bland ,  fried too hard and rubbery .   finally two ppl from our party ordered the lobster ravioli for an entree .   it was not lobster ravioli but beef .  i asked our waiter and one other waiter to please double check with the chef because this is not lobster ,  i expressed that i have not eaten beef or pork since 1994 ,  and that it would make me ill .  they both came back separately and argued that it was in fact lobster .  another party of maybe 6 ppl ordered the lobster ravioli ,  they had the same problem and sent their dishes back to the kitchen too .   the server finally came over after i ' d eaten two of the ravioli to apologize for the kitchens error and telling us that was in fact beef .   i have been in the bathroom all day with diarrhea from the beef ravioli !  the staff was very nonchalant about it and offered an insincere apology .

( side note :  the bread is served from a bag ,  it ' s light and crispy on the outside and airy  on the inside .  .  .  it tastes good but easily crumbles )   the waitress wiped the table but left a considerable amount of crumbs on the table  .  .  .  afterward ,  the waitress called me a  \" neat freak \"   ,  not once but twice  .  .  .  the neat freak comment was completely inappropriate .    second ,  the waitress was unfamiliar with the menu .  she did not seem to know whether or not the shrimp in the various dishes was deveined .    my third issue was with waiting 40 minutes for the crab cake appetizer .  one crab cake is  $ 18 .  the crab cake was actually good and savory ,  but it was disappointing waiting 40 minutes for one crab cake  .  .  .    our main course arrived about 15 minute after the crab cake .    i ordered the shrimp and angel hair pasta .  the buttery taste overwhelmed the dish .  since the dish lacked acidity ,  i requested lemons from the waitress .  the taste of the pasta was not a big deal  .  .  .  nothing a little lemon juice couldn ' t fix .    my fourth issue was with the waitress bringing the small cut lemons from the bar ,  instead of lemon wedges  .  .  .    the lemon cuts were so small that i was unable to squeeze lemon juice from the lemons  .  .  .   overall ,  i wanted to enjoy mr .  b ' s more than i did .  .  .  i have no plans of returning .

    "text": "i originally would have given red robin 3 stars ,  but my last experience three weeks ago was so terrible that i just can ' t do that anymore .   my server was one of the worst i ' ve ever had .   i just can not bring myself to go back for fear of getting the same guy and having this experience all over again .        here is the breakdown :   first ,  he took forever to come to our table and even take our drink order .   i was about to get up and leave .   it had been at least ten or fifteen minutes before he ever acknowledged us at the table and the place wasn ' t even crowded !   it was a weeknight .   i could understand if it was a busy weekend and the place was packed ,  but i ' ve been there on a busy weekend as well ,  and have not been treated like that .   however ,  i have on a weekday by a different server ,  but that ' s another story ,  and i left happy because a nice other waitress remedied the situation .   anyway ,  this guy finally takes our order and then takes another ten minutes to bring me my water and then starts to walk off again .   i tell him that i would like to order .   i tell him which burger i want and that i want it to be a turkey burger ,  and with no mayo .   he looks really confused and takes about 3 minutes to write that down .   then he repeats the name of the burger .   i say ,   \" yes ,  with turkey and no mayo please .  \"   he starts writing again for what seems like forever and then my boyfriend tries to order .   then he starts to walk away and my boyfriend says ,   \" i ' d like it medium - well ,  please .  \"   he looked confused and was like ,   \" oh .  .  .  \"    then he asked me ,   \" how about you ?   medium well ?  \"   i said ,   \" mine is turkey ,  so i would like that cooked properly please .  \"   he said ,   \" well ,  they ' re going to ask me how you like it cooked .  \"   i said ,   \" 165 degrees please ,  which is the temperature turkey should be cooked to in order to be cooked properly .  \"   he tried to argue with me about it and then kind of laughed and walked away .   that is a health hazard under - cooking poultry !    what is wrong with this guy ?   i don ' t think this guy knew anything about food or had ever waited tables in his life .       then ,  i finally get my food thirty minutes later and it is slathered in mayonnaise .  i try to get his attention for a while ,  but he ignores me ,  and i am so hungry at this point and this want to leave this place because this guy is annoying me that i just rip the top half off ,  wipe it off with my napkin and try to eat part of it .   he comes back about 20 minutes later when i ' m about done and was like oh was it good .   i told him about the mayo and he said ,   \" well ,  i didn ' t know that .  \"   then he just walked away !   weird !  he didn ' t say he was sorry and acted like it was my fault even though i ' d repeated it twice when i ordered !   so rude too !   finally ,  we couldn ' t get him to bring the check and had to flag him down again .   i thought i would never get out of that place !   it was the worst service i have received in a very long time .   although i enjoy red robin ' s turkey burger ,  this service really turned me off to the place .   a lot of time will have to pass before i consider giving it a go again ,  if i ever do .

    "text": "i have to admit i ' m surprised by my experience .  when i saw this place had over 200 ratings and a 4 . 5 average i expected something more than what i got .   i ordered the falafel platter which came with tabouleh salad ,  hummus ,  mixed vegetables  &  a side of pita .   as a whole ,  everything seemed to be at least a day old .  everything was very stale and just did not feel right as you attempted to chew it .   if i ever storm a castle and have archers firing at me from atop a tower ,  i would like to be wearing armor made from the falafel because i would be unstoppable .   the pita ,  i would not serve to small children nor the elderly because it ' s a choking hazard .  it had the consistency of that fruit leather you used to get from the cafeteria in elementary school .    you know how if you put a lot of sugar in your coffee people make that joke  \" you want some coffee with your sugar ?  \"  well that ' s what they would say about the amount of parsley in the tabbouleh .   i understand tabbouleh is supposed to have a lot of parsley ,  but this was to the point where i couldn ' t call it tabbouleh .   they just gave me straight up minced parsley with a countable amount bulgur grains that seem to have accidentally fallen in .   the hummus was not that bad .  it tasted like it had a bit too much lemon juice going on and maybe could have used a bit more tahini ,  but overall it was just ok .   the overall taste of everything was not bad ,  but it did not resemble anything that i would call close to good .  think of a delicious cheesesteak from pat ' s or gino ' s or dalessandro ' s that ' s a day or two old .   it would taste like it ' s a day or two old ,  but you could still tell that it would have been delicious had it been fresh .  i can ' t say that with the meal i just had from smiley ' s .   it didn ' t taste bad like i could not stand putting it into my mouth ,  but i can ' t say i found it even pleasant .  i ' d get as excited for it as i would for a plain bowl of oatmeal made with water .   i think i rate very fairly and it hurts me that i have to give this establishment such a low rating .  i will admit that there is a possibility that ,  given the other stellar reviews ,  i may have just had a rare bad experience .  unfortunately ,  that is all i have to go off of .  i may try it again some day if i ' m with somebody who really wants to go there .   until then ,  no thanks .

    "text": "i just had the worst experience i ' ve ever had at a restaurant here .  avoid it like the plague .    we didn ' t even get to ordering the food before we left in intimidation .   so ,  we had ordered coffee ,  someone ordered decaf ,  but then changed her mind to decaf .  our waitress brought both decaf and regular .  when we pointed out the confusion ,  in a very understanding way  ( really making sure that she knew that we totally see how the confusion had occurred )  .  this lady got angry !  left me speaking half way through and gave me her back ,  she came back with another thing of regular coffee ,  and started to bang our silverware on the table with a face of complete discontent .    she didn ' t provide a straw for a tea ,  and there was another waitress near by .  not wanting to upset our waitress even more my brother ' s fiancee asked this other waitress for a straw .  she looked at her also with an attitude ,  and she said :  both of my hands are full ,  can ' t you see !    full disclosure :  both of these waitresses were african american and my family is hispanic .  i don ' t know if there ' s some sort of racial issue in new orleans between these two races ,  but it just seemed that there was a lot of aggression for things that are pretty normal at a restaurant .    we said we wanted to leave and asked for the check and the manager .  the manager came ,  and asked us what the situation was .  our waitress had these threatening eyes on us the entire time ,  and the manager asked her to step aside ,  at which point the waitress started raising her voice .  we said to the manager :   \" this attitude is precisely why we want to pay and leave now and handed her  $ 20dlls without looking at the bill  ( but we had asked for 2 coffees ,  1 tea ,  water ,  and 2 diet cokes ,  a lot less than  $ 20 )  .  i was expecting for an apology and to let us go without pay since we had barely touched our drinks .  however ,  she took our  $ 20dlls .  and left the table .  all the while three people with long hair peaked from the kitchen staring us also in a very threatening way .  it was actually very scary .  when the manager picked up our  $ 20dlls we didn ' t wait for the change and left the table .  we were actually worried for a little bit about being followed by the guys staring at us from the kitchen ,  but it was all fine .  we ' re just never going back .    it is a real shame ,  because i really like ihop .

    "text": "went there for lunch before they moved locations and myself and husband were pretty impressed .   just think about how excited we were to hear that they were now open for breakfast at their new location !    we visited there on a sunday morning for breakfast .   husband isn ' t home that much due to work so we wanted to enjoy a sit down breakfast together before running our errands for the day and thought we would try out the new breakfast menu  ( belgian waffle with side of bacon for me and disco ball for my husband )  .   walked in to no line at all and placed our order at the counter .   went around to pay ,  grab our fruit tea ,  and took a seat .   we looked around and noticed what appeared to be a couple people  ( i ' m assuming at this point )  ordered food after their group did .   didn ' t really think anything of it .   after approx .  20 mins ,  my name is called .  they put my belgian waffle down  ( no sign of side of bacon )  and tell us that my husband ' s meal is right behind them .   my husband didn ' t want my food to get cold so told me to go ahead without him .   i ate my entire waffle and he still didn ' t have his food .   plates were slowly making their way from the kitchen to the other people ' s tables .  my husband still waiting for his .   i finally go to the counter and ask about his plate .   they hand me a plate that was sitting on the counter and says  \" breakfast takes longer to cook .  \"   ummmmmmmmm .  .  .  . ok .  .   they didn ' t seem apologetic in the slightest even though i told them that i ' ve already finished my breakfast .   i took his plate to him and went back up for my side of bacon .   he literally finished his food before my side of bacon was brought to the table .   his food was cold and the look of the meat on his plate was questionable .   the quiche was pretty good though !   needless to say ,  our planned nice sit down breakfast together turned out to be far from our expectations which included a price tag of  $ 30 .   if you go for breakfast and plan to eat together .  .  . you may want to take a snack to eat while others in your party enjoy their plates one by one .

    "text": "this is a really bad establishment overall .  we found the restaurant ' s decor impressive however this restaurant demonstrates really bad waiter service and probably acts of greed .  it ' s a disgrace that this restaurant is serving as a living representation of taiwanese culture .   first of all ,  the food is decent enough considering that it is away from the bay area ,  which thusly does not introduces competitive taiwanese restaurants .  if this restaurant were in the bay area ,  the restaurant would be sure to go out of business .  at the restaurant ,  we ordered stinky tofu and it was unbelievable when we were given only 8 pieces for 5 dollars .  that equals to about roughly 60 cents per piece .  that is ridiculous considering the dedication and size of these pieces .  besides from that ,  we decided that the food is reasonable enough although it was smaller portioned compared to the bay area taiwanese restaurants .    the waiter service as mentioned previously is horrible .  the waiters offered no expression of gratitude for keeping them in employment .  in addition ,  as we left ,  the waiter offered no thanks and greedily halted his task on hand and searched visually our table for our tips .  this is ridiculous .  i understand that the all people want money .  or else why work ?  the problem is that he doesn ' t mask his temptations and greed of money and plainly expresses it .   the decor in the restaurant is one good aspect of the restaurant .  i found the restaurant rather comfortable and the television was conveniently angled so then the customers do not need to turn their necks uncomfortably .  i loved the painting of taipei 101 on the wall as well .  the kitchen was opened to us and from what i see ,  the kitchen looks pretty clean .   the thing that makes me angry at this establishment is the inclination of the waiters to whites opposed to non - whites .  the waiter offered better services to our neighboring table of whites however ,  offered less then decent services to us non - whites .  we found this consistent throughout the restaurant .  now ,  i honestly don ' t care what the reason of discrimination may be but this is beyond acceptable .

    "text": "i was visiting from out of town and excited to try herbies .  it was such a sad state of affairs .  as a former st .  louisian ,  i am very interested in making sure businesses are thriving .  this restaurant is doomed .  the waiter was nice but everything took a ridiculously long time to receive .  my friend ordered a french onion soup and it came in a coffee cup sized portion and apparently was bland .  my other friend and i got salads that were unmentionably average .  then it took literally over 30 min to receive our entrees .  my first friend ordered the veal chop and it was actually good .  my other friend ordered the salmon and it was ok and appropriately prepared .  i ordered the roasted chicken after bragging to the waiter that i am a roasted chicken connoisseur and he highly recommended their roasted chicken .  i am not exaggerating when i tell you it was smaller than my fist  ( i am a petite woman )  .  the drum stick portion was smaller than my pinky finger .  it was actually very cute but ridiculous for  $ 28 .  it was over cooked ,  dry and basically i got about 3 bites of actual chicken .  we had to complain because i thought it was a joke .  the waiter explained that these chickens are 28 days old when they are cooked .  so they are basically baby chickens .  if they gave two in a portion i could have understood the cost .  when we complained ,  they offered another one to eat .  it took at least 15 more minutes to receive this one and the waiter offered to wrap it up because it was obvious we were ready to get the heck out of there .  we talked to the manager and he had no interest in our story .  i ' m mostly just sad that this restaurant was so bad and will likely not survive .

    "text": "after a long day last sunday trudging through the woods to clean and clear trail myself and two other friends decided to go out for dinner .   we stopped at the pic - a - lilli on rt .  206 and it was packed shoulder to shoulder .   so we decided to go to la campagnola instead ,  just before five o ' clock .   it was really kind of empty at that time .   i read on the bill board outside that they offer an early bird special until 5 : 30 .   we sat at the bar and the tall skinny young bartender ,  that plays college volleyball and looks like clarke kent  ( i don ' t know his name )  hands us menu ' s .   i had to ask for the early bird menu ,  it wasn ' t automatic .   i ordered the fettuccine campagnola which was a white cream sauce with peas and small cubes of prosciutto ,  it also came with ,   \" soup ,  salad and my choice of two desserts .  \"   i ordered the seafood bisque for my soup and wanted a house salad and a cannoli for my dessert .   the bartender says ,   \" it is soup or salad \"  and i explained that there was a comma in between the words  ' soup ,  salad '  and not and  ' or '  !   i told him i wanted soup and salad .   remember i walked through the woods so at that point in the day i was starving !   i ordered a beer while i was waiting and the soup came out .   it was just ok .  .  . nothing too great ,  no real hunks of seafood .   then i expected for my salad to come out and instead the pasta dish comes out .  .  .  . so i ask ,   \" where is my salad ?  \"  and the bartender responds again ,   \" it is soup or salad \"  as if i am mentally disabled .   i said ,   \" yes ,  i know ,  but i wanted salad too .  \"   he said ,   \" oh ,  ok .   i can go get that right now .  \"  as my pasta dish was sitting there getting cold .   i told him forget about it at this point my entree is here already .   apparently it was the end of his shift and he was more concerned about cashing his drawer out than waiting on us .   then he was a douche on top of that explaining that it was  ' or '  even though the friggin menu had a comma which indicates and !  !   all the while making me out to be some kind of retard .   anyway ,  having a father that is an executive chef from italy and growing up in the restaurant business ,  i know that the customer is always right !   i won ' t be going to that dump anymore !   eff that place .  .  . they should hire people that aren ' t kids and people that know how to type a specials menu !

    "text": "terrible customer service !   nice ,  beautiful sunday afternoon ,  we wanted to sit outside ,  have a drink and eat a late lunch .   the hostess took us to our table which was in the sun  ( all the other tables were under the pavilion in the shade )  and there was a table with young kids right next to this table .   we wanted a nice quiet lunch to ourselves since it was a day without kids for us .  we asked to sit on the other side where it was quieter and it was in the shade .   we were told we could not sit there because there was no server there .   i asked if the server could maybe walk two tables over she said no .   we went inside and asked for a manager and we were directed to the same hostess yet again and was told they didn ' t know who the manager would be that we need to talk to .   we were so excited when we walked up because it was the perfect atmosphere on the perfect day to be outside .   needless to say we did not stay and will never go back .
