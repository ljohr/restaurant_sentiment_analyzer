    "text": "we ate here a few days ago and it was good .  .  .  but not great .  our server was nice and our food came out quickly .  i loved the selection of craft sodas they had .  we ordered calamari ,  the popeye pizza with some added veggies and each had dessert .  our calamari was crispy but not golden brown and not delicious .  .  .  it was very blonde and greasy ,  our pizza was ok when it was hot ,  but the crust was really soggy in the middle and our desserts had to be store bought .  .  .  my chocolate mousse cake left much to be desired and his key lime pie tasted like sweet custard .  no key lime flavor at all .  we took the rest of our pizza home to reheat .  .  .  they soggy crust had become even more soggy and was impossible to eat .  .  .  .  i want to like this place ,  but don ' t know if i ' ll risk wasting my money again .

    "text": "i love baileys '  range ,  so when i was in town for just the weekend with 2 of my friends ,  i insisted that we go there .  we had an average wait time  ( about 30 mins on a saturday night )  which we thought was great .  however ,  upon being seated we waited about 10 minutes before water was even brought to us .  and then waited another 10 - 15 minutes before we were asked what we wanted to drink .  we waited about another 10 - 15 minutes for our drinks  ( the limoncello is delicious and refreshing for summer )  .  our food came quickly  ( maybe 20 minutes after we ordered )  .  it came hot and delicious ,  but we were missing sauces ,  out of water and our server was no where to be found .  maybe another 10 minutes after we had gotten our food we were finally provided with more water and out sauces .  the food was very good ,  did not disappoint .  after we were done ,  we waited with our plates for about another 10 minutes before our serve came .  we then requested our checks ,  which is the first thing they brought promptly all night .  we got our cards out ,  then waited another 10 - 15 minutes before she picked up our checks ,  which seemed odd to me because typically turn around once you get the check seems to be pretty quick in most restaurants .  perhaps the server was double sat ,  or new or something ,  which i could understand the slowness ,  but the server never apologized for us having to wait on her countless times .    tldr ;  the food was excellent as always ,  but the service was severely lacking on this trip .  honestly bothered my whole dining experience there .  hopefully they do better next time .

    "text": "marrakesh is obviously all about the experience .  from the low - key location on leithgow street to the doorbell you have to ring and wait to be greeted before entering .  the interior is dimly lit and full of vibrant colors from tapestries and decorated pillows that adorn the seating areas .  our party of six was seated in a backroom upstairs  -  incredibly comfortable and got me excited for the meal .   the waiter first arrives and asks for very few decisions about the 7 - course meal .  we opted for the spicy chicken and then the lamb entree ,  accompanied by a vegetarian option for our one friend .  we also ordered two carafes of cheap wine  -   $ 12 each .  the waiter then returns with a partner carrying a giant metal bowl with a teapot on top .  he asks that everyone puts their hands in the center of the table then pours water over them and asks you to wash up ;  a towel is placed over everyones '  hands to dry off .  they soon return with smaller towels that are draped over your laps in indication of the messy meal that will soon begin .   the first course is a three - salad platter consisting of cucumber and tomato  -  coriander marinated carrots and cooked eggplant in tomato sauce .  they bring out a giant basket full of pita breads and offer you to take as many as you ' d like .  this salad was delicious and probably my favorite part of the meal .  next is a giant pie made of phyllo dough stuffed with scrambled eggs ,  parsley and ground chicken .  it ' s topped with powdered sugar and cinnamon .  this wasn ' t well received because the chicken was sparse and the dish was too sweet overall .  it was also very hard to eat the crumbly ground chicken and eggs with your hands .   two main courses are presented  -  the first being an entire roasted chicken covered in a spicy cumin sauce .  this chicken was delicious ,  perfectly cooked but the skin was not crispy enough for my taste ,  fortunately it was easy to remove .  next is a roasted lamb shank off the bone ,  covered in honey and slivered almonds .  the meat was cooked well but like the chicken pie ,  this dish was way too sweet for my tastes .  finally is a couscous with chick peas ,  raisins and shredded chicken .  i prefer my couscous sticky and salty but this was very sweet and moist ,  almost stew - like .   for dessert you are brought a plate of bananas ,  oranges and apples ,  a plate of delicious baklava and very sweet hot mint tea .   overall marrakesh is a lot of fun  -  you get to experience a traditional moroccan meal and have plenty of time to relax and chat with your friends .  i would have prefered less sweet and more savory dishes but others might disagree .  expect to spend around two hours eating .  after wine we thought it was a bit pricey but still not too bad for the city  -  it came to about  $ 37 a person including tip .

[10 / 23 / 14] :  my second visit here solidified my 3 - star impression ,  although now it ' s a pretty weak 3 stars .  the coconut crunch shake was good ,  but my classic burger was dry and plain - tasting .  i ordered it medium rare ,  but it came out well done .  gah .  also did not get a side of regular ketchup with my burger this time .  the waitress was nice though .

    "text": "went to bailey ' s on a suggestion from my son after a cards game .  there were six of us so we were able to taste quite a few things .   for appetizers we tried the fried pickles and smoked jalape\u00f1o chicken wings .  our party enjoyed both appetizers .  the pickles were perfect with a delightful batter .  if you are a fan of jalape\u00f1os please order the chicken wings .  .  . the jalape\u00f1o flavor is very prevalent .   as far as the burgers are concerned we ordered dave ' s chop house ,   the gyro ,  carolina bison ,  and the buffalo .    the gyro was our least favorite mainly because it didn ' t taste like a gyro .  the lamb meat was very bland and the cucumber sauce was nonexistent .    the buffalo was juicy and flavorful ;  it tasted as expected .   dave ' s burger was just ok .  we were looking to taste more bacon but the rosemary was overwhelming .  i ended up taking the meat and just eating it without the bread and toppings .   the carolina bison was the overall favorite !  just delicious .   we gave three stars because all of the meat was fantastic .  .  . fresh and awesome but we were disappointed in just a few things which took the score down .    1 .  it was overly warm in the restaurant ;  as though the air wasn ' t on and no ice was offered for our waters .   after a baseball game and walking to the restaurant it would ' ve been nice to walk into a cool place .   2 .  we all had ice cream and felt it was subpar ;  mainly because it was melting so fast .  i ordered the sweet sweet bacon shake and was disappointed when it arrived with no bacon  &  no explanation .  10 minutes after the shake arrived i was told they were out of the bacon .  .  . my whole reason for ordering the shake .  the shake had a great flavor but i ' m sure it would ' ve been more awesome with the bacon .   3 .   the fries were below standard .  when you pay 12 +  dollars for a burger you expect great fries to accompany that burger .  the many dipping sauces were fine but these fries were obviously frozen not terrible but frozen .  fresh cut fries to go with the extremely fresh burger would ' ve been better .

    "text": "had dinner here on our first night in st louis .   shared the toasted ravioli as an appetizer .  good stuff .   the main course was a medium rare porterhouse steak for me and the rack of lamb for the little lady .  sides were four cheese potato au gratin and a baked potato ,  plus the house salad .  good stuff .   finished it off with an italian custard with fresh fruit and a rum raisin ice cream .  and a cappuccino .  all good .   the service was very friendly and attentive .  maybe too attentive .  as we fished one course ,  they immediately brought out the next .  fast service is normally great ,  but come on ,  gives us a little time to digest between courses .

    "text": "it pains me to give this review because we ' ve had a lot of good meals here in the past but our last two dinners here had identical problems .   we went here for dinner last night .  it was pretty busy for a tuesday night so we expected a little bit of a wait for our meal .  but the wait was compounded by service issues .   we ordered the vietnamese pancake for an appetizer and pho and vermicelli for our entrees .  our order was taken pretty promptly but it took over a half hour for our pancake to be served .  a party who arrived after us got their appetizer about ten minutes before us .   it took another twenty minutes to get my vermicelli but baby ' s pho was nowhere to be found nor did our server  ( the older gentleman )  offer an explanation or apology .  we waited a minute or two but when the pho still didn ' t come ,  i flagged down the other  ( young )  server who said he would check into it .  he came back apologetically alluding to some issue and promised it would come soon .   finally ,  about five minutes later ,  our original server delivered the pho without a word nor any acknowledgement of a problem .  this is the same guy who at our last dinner forgot to place part of our order and then double charged us .    it seems we ' re not the only ones whose order he screwed up .  as we were taking care of our bill ,  we heard the party behind us pointing out that something was missing from their take - out order .   the owner used to be here frequently but we haven ' t seen him in quite some time so i ' m wondering if in his absence he ' s taken his eyes off the ball leading to the slippage in service .   we really want to continue supporting oriental pearl so i ' m hoping that they  take steps to get back on track .

( ok ,  they don ' t really charge for silverware ,  but you get where i ' m going with this .  .  .  i hate being nickeled and dimed for every little thing !  )  everyone in our group ordered something different ,  and though i don ' t recall what each person got ,  i only heard the verdict from everyone as we were walking out  ( note the 25 %   /  75 %  above )  .  i had the veggie burger and quinoa side salad .  the veggie burger was decent .  it was a sweet potato patty topped with pecan butter and spinach .  the quinoa salad was not my favorite and i was actually proud of myself for finishing at least half of it .  it ' s served cold and mixed with dried cherries ,  onions ,  and balsamic vinaigrette .  the onions were overbearing though .  .  .  that ' s the only flavor that came through .   at least the birthday girl enjoyed her shake ,  but as for me ,  i don ' t expect that bailey ' s will get another nickel or dime from my wallet anytime in the near future .

    "text": "we ' ve been going to saki almost every week  ( sometimes multiple times a week )  for the last 2 years .  most of the waitresses know us and are always nice and friendly ,  they greet us and even play with our kids .  the last several times we ' ve dined ,  the experience has been hit or miss ,  unfortunately .  some days the food is fantastic ,  other days ,  it ' s plain or oversalted  ( especially the salt and pepper shrimp )  our last visit ,  we came in to just eat sushi for dinner ,  and the crab topping they use for the sushi ,  such as the volcano roll ,  was old / spoiled .  you could smell the old oil off the plate .  we ordered about 6 rolls and most had some sort of crab on top .  we mentioned it to the waitress and she looked like she knew about it because she interrupted us while we were telling her what was wrong with it ,  and said it was ok to leave all the rolls .  needless to say ,  we ended up leaving hungry ,  since we couldn ' t wait for more rolls to be remade  ( and we were afraid we were going to get the same bad crab )  and ended up paying full price for just several appetizers .  that kind of ruined saki for me for the meantime .  we may try the new location in palm harbor ,  once it opens up .

( i lived in vienna for a couple of years and know what you find there .  )   the hungarian goulash is quite good ,  being authentically viennese  ( as opposed to hungarian )  in style .   i recommend it for chili lovers as a nice variation on the theme that most will like .   :  -  )   i ' m diabetic and avoid sweets ,  but the couple of bakery items that i ' ve tried have been excellent .   my husband has actually raved about the pastries .   unfortunately ,  if you eat here instead of taking food out ,  the service is slow ,  forgetful ,  and apathetic at best .   i ' ve had the wrong items brought ,  soup brought lukewarm presumably because it had been served up and then was left sitting to await the rest of the meal ,  and lengthy waits for the check .   this isn ' t some cultural difference between american expectations and viennese norms ;  the viennese wouldn ' t find this level of service any more acceptable than i did .   my recommendation ?   if you want to buy stuff to take home ,  this is a good place .   if you want to eat here ,  better bring lots of patience and a good book or good company because you will need it .

    "text": "three stars ,  but that had a lot to do with service being good .  as far as the food was concerned ,  i was pretty underwhelmed ,  if i ' m being honest .  having rather recently dined at a different seafood boil establishment  ( the shaking crab in norfolk va )  ,  i had a pretty good comparison pretty fresh in my mind ,  and with that ,  the boiling house under - delivered .    celebrating my mothers graduation ,  we decided to stop in and get a little messy on some seafood !  .  .  .  .  . or vietnamese noodles .  apparently this place is both a seafood boil and asian noodle house .  ooook .  after my mom threw the whole night into turmoil by ordering off the menu  ( which the staff were gracious enough to accommodate )  ,  we got on track and ordered .  one vegan in our party went with just cajun fries .   ( not many vegan options here ,  if thats a concern for you .  )  another has an issue with seeing her food look like it looks before its food  ( why did we come here again ?  )  so she went with some noodles ,  and my mother was playing fast and loose with the menu ,  so as far as the seafood boil goes ,  it was down to my sister and i to split a bucket .  snow crab legs ,  shrimp ,  potatoes ,  corn and a ciabatta roll ;  boiling house sauce ,  medium .    first thing that was weird was that although everything has to be ordered by the pound ,  our crab legs had to be ordered in 1 1 / 4 pound increments .  uh .  .  .  .  . ok .  whatever .  second thing is that ,  the corn was mushy .  boiling corn must be a hard thing to do ,  as it was the same problem at the shaking crab .  third thing ,  and this is a big deal ,  were the shrimp .  the shrimp were a good size ,  but they may as well have been made of pencil erasers .  they were soooooo chewy ,  and way more egregious than that ,  the shrimp weren ' t cleaned .  yuck .  it took me 10 minutes before i could even start eating ,  because i had to clean every shrimp myself .    the rest of the food was okay .  the crab legs were fine ,  the potatoes were fine ,  but nothing blew me away .  the sauce was .  .  .  .  . ok .  decent flavor ,  decent heat .  .  .  . a little watery .  .  .  . i was just like ,   \" meh ,  \"  the whole meal .    our server was cool ,  and put up with a lot ,   ( my mother is a handful )  but he was polite throughout ;  asking the kitchen to make her special dish ,  and even pointing out to us that there is a military discount ,  so we got 10 %  off of the meal .    the place was nice inside and its byob with no corkage ,  so they definitely have that going for them .    i can ' t say for sure either way if i ' d be back or not .  again ,  i wasn ' t thrilled with the meal ,  but aside from the shrimp ,  i wasn ' t put off by anything either .  i guess we ' ll see .   oh ,  the floor is like the icecapades .  we all almost broke our necks walking in ,  and our waiters assistant slipped and knocked over a bucket of ice .  wear something with some grip .

    "text": "frank ' s has really good pizza .   it is usually pretty droopy if you don ' t ask for the crust well done ,  but when it is done well ,  it is pizza perfection .   most of the items i have had from them have been really good ,  with few exceptions  ( don ' t get the eggplant )  .   they have a nice crust and you can tell that they use quality cheese .   then why 3 stars ?   .  .  .   we usually order delivery ,  and they have gotten our order wrong more times than right  ( and not just pizza toppings ,  we are talking meal orders ,  missing items paid for ,  etc )  .   they do their best to make up for it ,  but it takes the whole convenience and enjoyment out of delivery night .   i don ' t mean to beat this dead horse ,  but i already mentioned the limp crust ,  so don ' t forget to order it well done .   one time we called to order for delivery and asked if the mushrooms were fresh or canned / jar ,  and the person on the phone assured me that they only use fresh mushrooms .   that was a lie ,  as i can assure you that the mushrooms that were on our pizza were definitely soggy canned  ' shrooms .   i understand that is just a personal preference that will not affect everyone .   however ,  the employee should have checked with the kitchen before giving me the wrong info .    ( all of the other toppings i have had have been awesome .  )   lastly ;  i would say they are slightly overpriced .   that is the general consensus when my friends mention frank ' s .   i don ' t mind paying for quality food ,  but i would like it to show up at my door correctly .    ( side note :  their delivery drivers are very courteous and apologetic .  )   unfortunately ,  this place is hit and miss ,  but when they do get it right ,  it ' s my favorite delivery pizza pie in dunedin .

    "text": "ralph ' s on 9th street just off christian has been a philadelphia landmark for over one hundred years .  while 9th street has been a part of my life for as long as i can remember i have never eaten at ralph ' s .   now ,  i must say from the start ,  that ralph ' s is the kind of italian restaurant that i avoid .  ralph ' s is an old time ,  red sauce kind of place :  the kind of sunday macaroni and gravy that i grew up on .  but these days ,  i suppose i have grown beyond it .  having lived and studied in italy back in the 70 ' s ,  i experienced lighter ,  cleaner flavors in italian foods .  when i came home i introduced my family to these recipes .  that was the end of the red sauce tradition in our house .  the same reformation was happening in kitchens and restaurants across the country .  this was the era of julia child and the great culinary awakening .  restaurants like ralph ' s were old school .  the wonderful film  \" big night \"  lyrically illustrates the two worlds :  meat balls and spaghetti vs .  shrimp risotto .  recently an episode of lydia featured philadelphia and a trip to ralph ' s .  lydia ' s enthusiasm for ralph ' s traditions sparked a bit of guilt and regret .  as an italian american i had rejected and neglected long held culinary traditions .  as a philadelphian whose great  - grandparents settled on 9th in christian in 1885 ,  i had ignored and concealed my history .  i owed ralph the respect of their kitchen .  ralph ' s is a rather small space .  tables are close together ,  perhaps too close .  you can hear almost every conversation in the room :  some conversations not necessarily appropriate for dining .  the room is very dark ,  but immaculately clean .  the wait staff ,  all men ,  sharply groomed and attired in black ,  greets and serves with the utmost friendliness and attention :  perfectly traditional italian .  with menu in hand we carefully scanned to find the balance between traditional heavy red sauce and lighter fare .  as we scanned the selections we also watched what was coming from the kitchen .  no small number of dishes were bowls or narrow plates of red gravy that completely obscured whatever lay beneath .  this was not the direction we wanted to go .  lydia highlighted the chicken trombino .  so ,  that was our first pick .  the reason for her choice became clear when the dishes arrived .  the giambotta of egg ,  sausage and chicken looked promising .  although i knew giambotta as an eggplant and squash dish this version with egg merited investigation .  for our third dish we went for the veal with peppers and mushrooms .   as a starter we ordered a cup of the \"  pasta fazool  \"  ( pasta e fagioli .  )  as usual ,  if you read my other reviews ,  we would share our lunch .  requesting the waiter to bring extra plates for sharing is never a problem .   i suggest it strongly .  the minestra ,  the  \" pasta fazool ,  \"  warmed our chilled 9th street shoppers '  bones .  in many ways ,  the soup is the indicator of a good restaurant .  if the cooks are attentive to a simple soup ,  you know they will be attentive to the main courses .  ralph ' s rich and creamy bean soup hit the mark .   the main courses arrived in properly measured time .  we began with the giambotta .  as i mentioned ,  giambotta as i knew it was something of an eggplant and squash stew .  ralph ' s version is what i would call a frittata .  the portion was large and an easy share for three people .  the sausage and chicken enriched each bite .  but ,  there was one element that recalled the old style :  green peppers .  green peppers tend to be course and biting .  while they were a staple in recipes in my childhood ,  i no longer use them .   they have been replaced by fully ripe red or yellow or orange peppers .  we then moved to the veal .  for the three of us at the table ,  this was not an easy dish the veal was heavily coated in red sauce and green peppers .  it was just too strong .  nonetheless ,  i must say that this was exactly how my mother would make it when i was a child ,  and why ,  even as a child ,  i didn ' t care for it .  the veal arrives with a side of spaghetti in red sauce .  the spaghetti was cold and the sauce too heavy for my taste .   our last entr\u00e9e ,  the chicken trombino ,  was suggested by lydia and i can see why .  the chicken trombino is not a traditional italian american dish .  this recipe is clearly something from a different inspiration .  there is no heavy red sauce .  the full chicken breasts are served with clean ,  fresh chunks of tomato and seasonings .  the chicken trombino  ,  in its light preparation ,  is what i prefer in italian cooking .  it is very difficult to give a rating to ralph ' s .  clearly ,  ralph ' s offers foods with an italian american history more than 100 years old .  what they do ,  they do well .  the restaurant is small but meticulous .  the staff is elegant and affable .  the service is prompt and the food well prepared in its own style .  for many ,  ralph ' s is a rich and hearty experience of old time italian american food in new world .  for me ,  ralph ' s is an excursion to the past .  but ,  is it really a past that i wish to recall ?

    "text": "we stumbled onto this restaurant after seeing the very long line at hattie b ' s .  the atmosphere seemed really nice and the wait for a table much more manageable - only 10 minutes .  the menu choices were appealing and we put in an order for two burgers ,  fries ,  a fish sandwich and trail salad .   then we waited ,  and waited and waited some more .   fifty minutes later our food still did not arrive with no real explanation  ( or apology )  from our server .   the manager was pleasant and after she was alerted our food did arrive .  the burgers were tasty as were the belgian fries .  the trail mix salad had too many dried cranberries for my liking making it much too sweet .   i think with a different server the experience may have been more positive ,  but with so many great restaurants in nashville i won ' t be going back to find out .

    "text": "good food and for a chain very good food .  it lived up to its reputation of serving fresh food .  i give it three stars instead of four mainly because it ' s probably not on my top 10 places in reno for mexican food .  chipotle is not even my favorite mexican - themed chain restaurant .  that would be el pollo loco .  for my meal i got a burrito with beef ,  black beans ,  white rice ,  sour cream ,  cheese ,  lettuce and maybe some other stuff .  i added a patrone margarita and a bag of chips with what they described as their hottest sauce .  i had to wait about a month to try the place because the lines were so long the previous times i came .  the staff was friendly when i placed my order .  i got my burrito ,  chips and salsa when i paid and the maragarita came a few minutes later .  chipotle failed to live up to the hype with my first bite of food .  the chips are good quality chips .  the salsa tastes mass produced .  it was supposed to be their hottest salsa but it had a streak of that sweet ketchup flavor some shows up in salsas some times .  my favorite salsas are the red salsa from the michoacan region of mexico with its nice garlic kick .   the ingredients in the burrito were fresh ,  but there were two significant flaws .  no .  1 is that the rice overwhelmed everything else .  usually if one ingredient overwhelms a burrito it seems it is the beans ,  but not in this case .  it made the burrito bland and a little dry .  the second flaw was all the gristle i found on the beef .  my tray had more than a half dozen chunks of inedible meat on it by the time i finished .  i decided to spare yelpers a photo of that .  the margarita was okay .  i ' d get one again but it was routine .  there ' s basically two kinds of wine bars :  those that serve wine that wine geeks like  ( these are the ones that have the hardest time surviving )  and those that are a place where women feel safe to drink .  i get the sense that chipotle is a mexican restaurant designed to make gringos feel safe to eat there .   again ,  for a chain ,  they serve good quality food .  i can get better food for less money at a half dozen taquerias around town .   chipotle is a smoke jalapeno used in cooking .  for people who have never had a good chipotle in a mexican restaurant ,  i would suggest trying the camarones ala diabla  ( devil shrimp )  at la fuente in sparks .  it ' s quite a bit spicier than the hot salsa served at chipotle but it has great depth of flavor .

    "text": "i ' ve been a longtime fan of john besh  ( via his pbs series )  ,  so when the opportunity came up to visit new orleans ,  i jumped at the chance to try one of his restaurants .     it was definitely a mixed bag .   the rabbit / chicken pate and gumbo were well done ,  but once we moved on to the entrees the blue crab cavatelli and louisiana shrimp were served lukewarm ,  so it was hard to warm up  ( so to speak )  to these two dishes .   we didn ' t mention this to our server until the end of the meal ,  at which point the manager came over and had those two entrees removed from our bill .   service overall was not up to my expectations  our server only checked on us once during the course of the meal ,  and a folding tray twice crashed to the floor near us ,  this should have been fixed after the first occurrence .   overall ,  the food rated 3 stars ,  minus another star for the service ,  plus a star for adjusting our bill .   given the number of  \" star \"  restaurants in new orleans ,  it ' s doubtful if the besh offerings will be a priority for me in future visits .

    "text": "in a direct bobby flay vs .  jose garces match ,  i . e .  comparing bobby ' s burger palace and village whiskey ,  i ' d say bbp clearly wins .   village whiskey ' s biggest weakness is actually its high price .  taste - wise ,  my medium - rare burger with goat cheese and egg is comparable to bbp or 500 degrees .  the meat and egg were prepared the way i like it ,  and the toppings were of high quality ,  especially the cheese .   ( note that the egg yolk is runny !  if you don ' t like that or are afraid of salmonella ,  let them know .  )  the only thing i did not like as much was how heavily the hamburger buns were buttered .  that was just a little bit too much for my taste ,  but i know many people who would love the slightly sweet ,  buttery bun .  however ,  the burger i got was 16 dollars  ( 11 for the burger ,  3 . 50 for the cheese and 1 . 50 for the egg )  ,  which is exactly the price of the burger at craigie on main .  in case you don ' t frequent boston as much ,  craigie ' s is a  ' real '  gourmet burger where french fries and a small salad are included in the price .  at vw ,  we had to order french fries for 5 dollars on the side ,  which were delicious and came with a well - spiced ketchup .   i like the atmosphere of the place ,  and the location which made seating outside more pleasant than at bbp ' s right on walnut street .  the service also was excellent  ( very much unlike bbp )  .  the staff appears professional ,  they are attentive and fill up your water very regularly .   all in all ,  it ' s a 3 . 5  -  the good burger ,  atmosphere and service warrant a high rating ,  but the extraordinarily high price  ( for what you get )  is rather a downer ,  and i can ' t give 4 stars to a place where i am unsure whether i ' d want to come back .  i do like the concept of letting the customer choose their own toppings ,  which allowed me to choose a combination of toppings you never see but i personally enjoy .  on the other hand ,  the menu of this place is largely uninspired and boring ,  which in turn is bobby ' s burger palace ' s strongest point .  if you are in the area ,  this is probably the highest quality burger  +  fries you can get  -  but it comes at a steep price .

    "text": "i was surprisingly not pleased about maynard ' s after reading all the decent reviews i expected a lot more .  i don ' t live in tucson but my girlfriend does and i only get to see her about 2 nights every couple months so its a special occasion when i do make it up to tucson .  wanting to take her somewhere nice we booked maynards .    arriving we had a hard time trying to find parking which wasn ' t the restaurants fault as downtown tucson is undergoing some major improvements .  once we got inside the hostess was nice .  we sat down and it took awhile for our waiter to make his way to us .    we both were really excited and hungry for a good meal ,  the bread was extremely slow coming out and was rock hard ,  the service was not the best ,  our waiter was slow and didn ' t seem very busy even though it was friday night .    i ordered  \" the burger \"  and my girlfriend had the filet mignon .  the food made it out decently timed ,  but i was unhappy when i took a bite into my burger i ordered it medium and it was burnt to the crisp ,  way past over done and had no color ,  just burnt black .  for a 20 dollar burger it was not what i expected had no flavor what - so - ever .  but the bacon i bought for an extra 2 . 00 on the burger was really good so that ' s a positive .    now for the positives ,  the bacon was really good ,  the size of the burger was perfect .  and the french fries on the side were amazing .    my girlfriend loved her steak and i took a bite and it was really good so i was happy with her meal and she loved my fries as well .   overall it wasn ' t that bad of an experience and i would dine there again ,  my rating is so low due to the burger not being cooked very good ,  might of been the waiters fault or the chief just wasn ' t feeling on his burger game that night .  if we were to go again and i am sure we will i would definitely not be getting the burger and focus on there steak which was really good .

    "text": "beautiful shop ;  hands down one of the best ones i ' ve ever seen .  it ' s very modern and chic in a way .  love the creativity of the door handle being a rolling pin ,  the light fixtures as wire whip mixers ,  and incorporating the love sign into a beautiful center piece for the top back wall .  everything was very artsy and creative .  i noticed the bright displays of cupcakes and assorted treats and most of all ,  the gorgeously decorated occasion cakes  ( hint hint :  weddings are their specialty )  .  they blew me away !  it ' s like something you ' d only see on tv !    we couldn ' t resist ordering their uniquely flavored cupcakes .  chocolate cake with raspberry icing and lavender something with pistachio icing .  plus ,  if you find a purple center in your cupcake ,  you can get another one for free .   ( definitely not a marketing scheme ,  but i admire the game even though we ' re being played .  )   to get to the point :  the first thing i tried was the icing .  .  it was literally so hard i had to dig my teeth into it to get a bite .  i feel like i would ' ve like it if it was softer and more like icing ?  the chocolate cake was like any other .  my fianc\u00e9e ' s cupcake was strange !  !  the icing literally tasted like stale ,  natural butter  ( or maybe more closely similar to lard !  ?  if you ever tasted lard ,  you ' ll know that distinct flavor it has .  )  the icing was also hard as a rock .  however ,  the lavender mixed  ( don ' t know what with )  cake wasn ' t half bad ,  though nothing stood out to me as special .   iffy on whether or not we ' ll be back .  i want to like this place ,  but that just might be the pastry enthusiast in me talking .

    "text": "i ' m not a vegetarian or vegan but i enjoy the food from time to time .  i ordered the ziggy burger it was eh .  it was really dry and not much flavor ,  there wasn ' t much of the special sauce on the burger to begin with and i think if there was more it would ' ve tasted better .  my friend got the philly steak and said it was pretty good .  we shared the sweet potato fries with the sriracha ailoi which was really good !  space is very limited for seats and my friend sitting on the shared bench was being moved every someone got up or sat down ,  kind of annoying .  the staffed seemed nice but kind of impatient .  overall it was alright .  if i come again i ' ll get something else since the burger just wasn ' t good and maybe i ' ll have a better opinion about the food .  i will say the people who ordered a few of the drinks they have looked good .

    "text": "visited here for the first time after reading the reviews .   the food was very good ;  however ,  the service was lacking and most of the tables were complaining about the length of time it took to get their food .   the table next to us waited about 1 / 2 hour just to get a server to take their order .  i had that spaghetti carbonara ,  which was delicious .   my wife ordered eggplant parm ,  which she said was really tasty .  our water and bread was never refilled .  the waiter seemed more concerned about the customers on the outdoor patio .   the thing that annoyed me most was when i asked for change from the bill ,  it took forever to bring the change .   i asked another server if we could get the change and she responded with  \" change is really hard to find around here .  \"   and then they gave me change but not the correct amount .   guess they didn ' t want to give coins back but every establishment i ' ve ever visited gives you the full change .  i am a very good tipper  ( 20 - 25 %  )  as my former career was in a gratuity based industry but nothing annoys me more than when a waiter doesn ' t want to give you change because they feel it should all be theirs for a tip .

    "text": "eh .  as others were saying ,  the design is pretty bad .  it took an hour to get out of the parking garage .  elevators take forever ,  so we took the stairs ,  just to be greeted by a locked door .   i ' m sure there are varying opinions on this ,  but i ' m in the boat with the people saying i thought d & b was chuck e cheese for adults .  little kids everywhere .  i don ' t mind gaming with teenagers ,  but there were probably 100 toddlers in this place .  there ' s people with strollers taking their infants .  people ,  please go to chuck e cheese .   i guess there ' s an any - age policy at the whole chain ,  it ' s just not what i was expecting .  if anything ,  they should make it adults - only  ( or at least 13 +  )  on weekdays and maybe open it up to all on weekends .  i know that banning kids would cut into their customer base ,  but this makes older people not want to go ,  so pick your poison .  i thought adults were the target market but that ' s not even close to the truth .   as far as the games ,  i didn ' t see anything for more than two players .  i don ' t know how arcade games have evolved in the past 20 years ,  but way back in the day you could play some with four .    the best i saw was a downhill ski racing game ,  where you stand on it and steer with your feet .  cold air in your face for added effect .   the walking dead game was pretty cool .  kind of weird to have a crossbow that you reload instantly with 8 shots at a time .   .  .  .  . but i guess they ' re not going for realism in a zombie game .  it ' s just a license for marketing ,  it ' s a generic zombie game .  no show or comic characters .  i don ' t care either way ,  it ' s not a bad game .  there ' s a racing game that takes a picture of your face before the race ,  and is connected to other machines at other locations .  my friend and i were in tears laughing at this ,  since we would pick out a victim at the start of the race and try to ruin their day by running them off the road and making sure they lose .  we just picked whoever looked most likely to cry .   there are plenty of bad games to make up for the good ones ,  but overall i actually had fun .  not sure if i ' ll be returning unless i find time to go when school is in session .  however ,  i guess that wouldn ' t stop two year - olds from being there .

    "text": "was visiting to fort de soto for spring break when i found this little gem through yelp .   had the ceviche mixto which was fresh .  i was completely surprised at how the ceviche tasted very fresh .  peruvian food is one of my favorite food .  thankfully ,  they didn ' t botched this dish .   i had the arroz chaufa with chicken .  it was pretty good ,  but unfortunately the rice is a undercooked .  this was kind of a turn off for me because of the undercooked rice .  honestly ,  it will be a good arroz chaufa if it had used fully cooked rice .  i suggested the bistec a la chorillana .  the chorillana sauce was delicious .  the steak was juicy  ( he ' d asked for medium )  .  the yuccas were crispy on the outside and not mashed .  the arroz that came along with his meal was once again undercooked .   the sangria was pretty damn good as well .  can ' t go wrong with a glass of sangria in the hot weather of florida .  it was 6 dollars too .  cant go wrong with that .   forgot to mention about the portion size .  the portion size here is really big !  i could totally make my arroz chaufa to be my lunch for the next day ,  and my date ' s meal was pretty large sized too .   anyhow ,  if i come back around tampa again .  i will defiitely give this place a second try .

( just a tip ,  avoid the banana margarita !  )  it took our waitress forever to check on us again and we ended up going up to the bar anytime we needed something .  we didn ' t even think about ordering food ,  considering the service we were receiving wasn ' t ideal .  the drinks were good and our waitress was polite ,  just not very attentive .  i still enjoyed my experience here and would consider coming back !  infact ,  i see another mango margarita in my future .

    "text": "i fell in love with three muses after looking at yelp reviews and the restaurant ' s website .  i feel that the website led me to believe it was a more formal tablecloth kind of place and i was a bit surprised when i arrived .   i could care less about tablecloths ,  just a minor observation as a direct result of the website .   when we arrived 20 minutes early for our 6pm tuesday evening reservation we were greeted by the hostess and immediately informed that no matter what ,  there is a very strict policy that we would only have the table for 1 . 5 hours and that if we wanted to enjoy the music after that ,  we would have to go to the bar .  i completely understand why this is their policy ,  but early on a weeknight when the restaurant is more than half empty it is a bit rude to start with the policy .  plus ,  what if our meal had taken longer than 1 . 5 hours ?  are you booted to the bar for dessert ?   anyway ,  onto the food .  .  . below is a list of the items we ordered any any commentary :    - italian baked mac  &  cheese - i love every kind of cheese possibly imaginable and i was so excited for this dish .  when it arrived the pasta was a little too firm and the flavor was extremely bland .   my friends and i barely ate a quarter of the dish .  i would never order that again .    - seared scallops - i didn ' t eat them but my friends thought they were scrumptious .    - bacon wrapped blue cheese stuffed dates - these were incredible .  for three of us we got the large order and though they were amazing ,  i kind of wish we got the small order only because they were so rich .  a good kind of rich .  i would order these again .    - beer - braised kurobuta pork belly - i thought these were really bland ,  too .  i wouldn ' t order them again .    - steak  &  cake - i only at the steak .  i was told the crab cake was amazing and one of the best my friend ever had .  the steak was awesome and so tender and flavorful .    - ms .  moon ' s bulgogi rice bowl - this item didn ' t seem to fit in as well with the other items on the menu but don ' t let it stop you .  it was very very yummy and i would absolutely order it again if i went back .  it was a hearty portion and the bowl was basically all but licked at the end to eat it all .    - cardamon panna cotta  ( ponchatoula strawberry ,  pistachio biscotti )  - i am not a huge panna cotta fan but my friend is and he loved it .  i thought it was pretty good when i tried it but have no frame of reference with which to provide any more feedback .     - fluffernutter pie  ( bruleed marshmallow ,  salted peanuts )  - i was intrigued by this option and ordered it .  i was underwhelmed and barely at any .    - warm chocolate cream cheese brownie  ( malted vanilla ice cream ,  cherry )  - per our waitress '  recommendation we substituted the vanilla ice cream for brandied butter pecan ice cream and boy was she right .  this was amazing .  i loved the ice cream the most out of all elements of the three desserts .  the brownie was tasty though i am not a huge chocolate fan .   the live music was nice and the atmosphere was okay .  i have a feeling later on a weekend it would be a lot more lively and fun  ( and packed )  .

    "text": "i went to han dynasty earlier this week and ordered some noodles and a fish dish .  we ' d never been there before and when the fish dish came ,  we took a few bites before realizing it was pieces of pork belly .  it was hard to tell at first due to the heavy colored sauce /  vegetables .  when we told the server that neither of us ate pork for religious reasons ,  the server replaced the dish .  however ,  by then we had lost our appetite .  when it came time to pay the bill ,  i was surprised that there was no discount for the mistake they had made .  i like the food overall ,  but the customer service is far from ideal .

    "text": "today was my first time visiting a red robin .  i had heard many good things about them from friends and family and decided to take my brother out for an early birthday lunch and a movie .  the restaurant appeared very clean and service was friendly and professional with just one tiny lapse .  the burgers were great and i was happy with the fact that the waitress didn ' t bat an eye when i ordered mine medium rare .  i have had restaurants tell me they won ' t serve burgers below medium and that just tells me that they don ' t trust the quality of their meat or kitchen staff .  the fries were a bit of a disappointment though .  my brother had bragged about how good they were and since we were in shortly after opening at 11 am ,  i expected them to be hot and fresh .  while they weren ' t horrible ,  they weren ' t very warm and several of mine were very hard ,  like they had been left to either cook too long or sat under a heat lamp for far too long .  again ,  they weren ' t horrible ,  it just seemed strange for them not to be fresh so early in the day .  all in all ,  i would happily go back again .   my one issue is something that is common to a lot of restaurants .  i am a big guy at 6 ' 1 \"  and around 315 lbs .  many restaurants ,  red robin included ,  have booths with their tables firmly mounted to the floor .  as a hostess ,  if you have a larger customer coming in ,  it might behoove you to consider seating your diner somewhere where they can be comfortable .  the restaurant was sparsely populated and there were regular tables and chairs ,  high top tables ,  and even bar seating that would have been far more comfortable for me rather than having me try and squeeze into a booth .  yes ,  i know that the simple answer is ,   \" lose weight !  \"  ,  but that doesn ' t change the fact that you should always try and make your customer comfortable .

    "text": "i have eaten at this place twice ,  and at the other restaurant once .   neither of these restaurants are very good .  these restaurants would get 1 or 2 stars west of the state of louisiana .  however ,  since so many people in tampa bay have never actually had great mexican or tex - mex food ,  they think this is the best mexican food they ' ve ever had .  and that ' s because it is ,  because they haven ' t eaten tex - mex in san antonio ,  tx ,  for example .  where they make tortillas that melt in your mouth  but back to red mesa .  i think i have found an accurate way to describe red mesa :   the food that you get here tastes no better than the  ( tex - mex )  food you would get at a mex chain like chili ' s ,  but red mesa fancies up the menu descriptions and jacks up the prices and adds a little hip restaurant decor in order to make you think the food is better than it really is .    it ' s just bland ,  mediocre tex - mex style food that can be had at chili ' s for much less money .   advice :  if you are going to eat here ,  stay away from the appetizers and side dishes and the tacos which are outrageously priced .   ( in texas they would laugh you off the street if you told someone you paid 5 dollars for a taco ,  like red mesa charges .  )  try to order a  \" combination \"  platter that has 1 ,  2 or 3 items for one price .  stay away from the guacamole ,  which is not worth 7 dollars .  just try to fill yourself up with the chips and get a combo dish .  desserts are also mediocre .

    "text": "this is my longest review because the service was pretty terrible so i have a lot to say .    my boyfriend and i had bought a groupon for this place in efforts to try something new for our anniversary dinner .  this place is cute ,  small and intimate .  we were greeted by a women in a t - shirt which i thought was odd because she was dressed if she was working in a pizza shop and not a restaurant .  she sat us down at the table and went over to the computer and tinkered around with it .  we assumed she was just the hostess and not the waitress .  as we waited for someone to take our drink order ,  it was enough time that we  read the entire menu thoroughly twice .  when we figured out what we wanted the women in the t - shirt was still at the computer  and no one took our drink order yet .   my boyfriend then got up and asked if she was the waitress and she nodded her head yes ,  so he told her we are ready to order when she was .  she then took another several minutes before walking over  with some chips .   we both have a gluten allergy and my boyfriend has a vegetable oil allergy .  we asked the waitress if the chips were cooked on vegetable oil and explained my boyfriend was allergic .  she said she didn ' t know and just stared at us .  my boyfriend then politely asked if she could go check .  she informed us are cooked in vegetable oil so of course he didn ' t eat them .  we ordered a chicken fajita and a chicken quesadilla .  the menu said have a choice of corn or flour for both items and we asked for corn .  our waitress was very confused as to why i was specifying corn tortillas because she said  \" we only have corn tortillas not the flour ones \"  i wasn ' t going to argue because i wanted corn .   ( at this point she still didn ' t take out drink order )  she placed the order and returned and tell us everything is cooked in vegetable oil .  .  .  so i asked her if we should leave or do you have any other substitute for vegetable oil and of course she said  \" i don ' t know \"  and stared at us .  again ,  my boyfriend had to asked her to go check for us .  at this point i imagine the owner or manager got involved .  he said he would cook everything in olive oil ,  and let me tell you the food was delicious !  we were pleasantly surprised after the huge headache of being there .  after the food came out we still had nothing to drink so we asked the manager if we could get some water and we ate .  i can ' t say enough about how good that mexican food was !   i got the check and the bill was  $ 30 . 25 which was perfect because our groupon was  $ 30 and our card could be charged  . 25 so we could tip the waitress .   ( i always tip regardless of the service ,  some people have bad days )  the check came back of wrong ,  not surprised and she took  $ 25 off our bill so i showed her it ' s  $ 30 not  $ 25 so i hand her the bill to adjust it and my card to charge me the  . 25 difference .   she comes back the bill saying it was now  $ 28 and we had no bill after the groupon .  i explained i only had my card and i wanted to tip her even if she did run my card for  . 25 .  she stared at us and said  \" uhhh ,  i don ' t know \"  my boyfriend said hey if you can work it out we will tip you but she said not worry about it .  i did feel bad but my boyfriend even said ,  she made the decision on not taking a tip .  pros -  great environment               great food               byob               accommodating to food allergies if you asked someone other then the waitress   cons  -  the service .  it was enough to not go back unless the manager agreed to let me take own order and personally give it took the cooks .  also help ourselves to some water .  .  . because the waitress won ' t .  it ' s a shame because the food has been amongst the best .  it could have been our new favorite place .

    "text": "we went on a friday evening around 5 : 30 and were seated outside on the covered patio right away .  we ordered 2 apps and a flight .  the chorizo nachos were huge and decent but the trout dip with pita bread chips is what stood out !  the dip came out with 6 pieces of bread placed in a circle around the dip .  i asked how much it would cost to get an order of more pita bread and guess what .  .  .  it was free !  score !   since both items were appetizers they came out in a matter of 5 minutes .  all around it was a wonderful experience with good weather ,  great service ,  good food and a flight with information about each beer !

    "text": "brought the kids here for lunch on easter sunday .   glad we came in ,  but it did fall short of my expectations .     teen 2 insisted on onion rings and both girls wanted milk shakes .   onion rings were giant ,  good and piping hot with yummy sauce .   they were absolutely dripping in grease though ,  and there was a large unappetizing pool of grease left on the plate .   better on the plate than in my stomach ,  but maybe they could have served them on paper towels or something .  .  .   both girls ordered brownie milkshakes .   they were delicious ,  but tiny .   i liked them so much i decided to order a peanut butter one for myself .   the lack of peanut butter flavor was a huge disappointment to me  -  i have this problem often as i like to be positively smacked in the face with peanut butter taste and many pb flavored things fall short of this .   the shakes were comically tiny for  $ 3 . 50 .   i had the american burger on a pretzel bun .   meat ,  mac n cheese ,  cheddar sauce ,  and bacon on a pretzel roll .   i didn ' t love the mac n cheese they used ,  but the burger was pretty yummy and i couldn ' t finish it all .     fries were served cold on the first go - round .   the waitress took them back and replaced them with hot fries without question .   the hot fries were much better and the teens loved the sauces .   we chose cheddar and rooster sauces .   service was excellent ;  our waitress was very friendly and we didn ' t want for anything throughout the course of the meal .   i would try them again ,  with a different burger and not a milkshake .   kids liked it though and it was a fun and casual way to spend an easter lunch .

    "text": "first understand how the  \" endless sushi and hibachi eatery \"  menu works .  if you are starving you will die before you get enough food in your stomach to quell the pains .  there is no  \" bar \"  to walk up to and select food from .  you place your order from the special menu one dish at a time .  the sashimi is limited to eight pieces per person and its thin slices of fish with no rice .  it was gone in seconds then i had to wait for the waitress to come back and take my next micro order of food .  so the deal here is to make you wait 15 minutes between dishes so you either feel full or get tired of waiting .  the policy is you must finish one dish before you can order another .  its an effective system to reduce consumption by dragging out the order process .   sushi  -  a little warm for my comfort level .   portions  -  sashimi is super small ,  the rolls were 4 - 6 pcs depending overall  -  its good but not if your starving .  your better off ordering off the regular menu .

    "text": "i made a reservation at muriel ' s for myself and three friends ,  after reading the glowing reviews .  we wanted to eat somewhere fun and elegant over the holidays ,  and muriel ' s fit the bill .  overall ,  it was a leisurely dining experience in a nice atmosphere ,  but there were some missteps .   first ,  the menu and prices on the website were different than what we were given in the restaurant .  not a big deal unless you have your heart set on something before you go .   then ,  we were served in a weird order .  three of us ordered the prix fixe menu ,  which includes appetizer ,  entree and dessert .  one friend also ordered a salad and i ordered an oyster appetizer in addition to our prix fixe dinner .    first ,  my two friends got their goat cheese crepe appetizer and i got my oysters .  then ,  after we ate that ,  they brought out my goat cheese appetizer and my friend ' s salad .  i would have thought they would have brought our oysters and salad first ,  then bring all of the goat cheese appetizers ,  but whatever .   the oyster appetizer was simply okay :  fried oysters set atop shells containing creamed spinach .  the parmesan cheese on top was crunchy and not pliable .  obviously not their signature dish .   the shrimp and goat cheese crepes were to die for .  the crepe was light and tender and the cheese filling was creamy and savory .  there was something off with the shrimp though .  .  . they were those transparent shrimp ,  i don ' t think they were gulf shrimp .   for my entree ,  i had the pecan crusted puppy drum .  only certain bites of it were flavorful for some reason .  i tasted my friend ' s chicken and it was terribly dry .  i tasted the other friend ' s barbeque shrimp ,  it was so delicious ,  it made me regret ordering the fish .   the flourless chocolate cake was really good .  the servers  ( all women )  were very professional .   my dining companions and i all dressed up ,  but there were many diners there in jeans and t - shirts .   tip :  do not park in the french market lot behind cafe du monde .  muriel ' s validates for up to 3 hours ,  so it ' s very tempting .  the lot is dark and isolated and there are not visible security personnel around .  when we were going back to our car ,  there was a guy in an alley ,  sitting on a bike .  as soon as we passed ,  he pulled out and rode behind us all the way to the entrance of the lot .  when we turned right to go to our car ,  he rode off to the left ,  and we breathed a temporary sigh of relief .  within two seconds ,  he made a u - turn and started pedaling to catch up to us .  my friend and i ran to the car and jumped in ,  and he rode past us ,  circling the lot .  when we got to the ticket booth ,  we informed the cashier that a man on a bike was lurking around the lot and we asked if they had a security person who could pass through the lot .  she acted like she couldn ' t understand what we were saying and waved us off with a a dismissive ,   \" okay ,  okay .  \"   pay the extra money and park in a more populated ,  well - lighted area .

    "text": "if i could give half stars ,  i ' d want to give 3 . 5 here .  it ' s definitely not yet at 4 ,  but more than 3 ,  no doubt .    i was super excited when i found out about this restaurant .  being from dallas ,  one of the big voids i felt here in st .  louis was the lack of proper crawfish ,  so when news broke of this place ,  i rejoiced .  after having the crawfish ,  i remain cautiously optimistic .  that having been said ,  i won ' t rave and say this place is amazing ,  because it isn ' t .  not yet .  however ,  i see much potential here .  i got 2 lbs of crawfish ,  corn ,  and cajun fries .  the corn was sweet and juicy and perfectly soaked up all the juice from my boil bag .  the shoestring fries were crispy and seasoned just right .  the crawfish was good .  not great ,  but good .  i was disappointed at the flavor .  i opted for the whole sha - bang  ( obvi the only way to go !  )  and went with mild on the spice level  ( my general spice tolerance is pretty low )  ,  afraid that anything higher that mild would make my nose leak and my lips burn .  however ,  the mild was ,  in fact ,  extremely mild .  i tried my fianc\u00e9 ' s top level spicy crawfish ,  and even that was doable .  i think they could probably afford to go more heavy handed with the spice on the flavor ,  and really kick it up a couple notches with the heat .  i must admit ,  though ,  that the buggers that were sitting and marinating at the bottom of the bag were quite flavorful and succulent ,  so that was a plus .  also ,  mopping up each crawfish in the remaining juice also helped with the flavor .    if crawfish isn ' t your thing ,  they have crab ,  oysters ,  shrimp ,  and other options .  shrimp basket was fantastic ;  one thing i generally dislike about fried food is all the breading .  the shrimp here were crisp with minimal breading ,  and the flavor was spot on .  interior is nice and spacious ,  and there is ample spaces to park .  extra points for having sinks in the back of the restaurant ,  outside of the restroom area ,  so you can quickly wash all the crawfish juice from your hands .    i remain highly optimistic for this place .  will i go back ?  100 %  .  do i recommend it ?  yes ,  definitely give it a try .  i am hoping that with some time ,  the flavors will really develop and i will really ,  really be mad for the mad crab !

    "text": "have only been once a couple of months ago ,  so maybe this was a one - off experience .  .  . ordered a piece of carrot cake ,  which tasted fine .  certainly not the best i ' ve ever had but good enough .  the to go packaging was a bit overkill just for that one slice of cake ,  as was the  $ 10 price tag .  that being said ,  i ' m sure the  \" fanciness \"  of the place is what makes it so appealing to folks .  it really is quite unique and cute for our area and would be a good place to go with the gals  ( rather than my husband who hates all things trendy ,  lol )  .    my problem ,  though ,  was with the service .  we placed our order for the carrot cake with a nice young teenager ,  and then waited .  and waited .  i could see the carrot cake just sitting in the pretty covered cake stand ,  and i felt really tempted to just slice it myself .  after a bit  ( felt like 10 minutes ,  although i ' m sure it was more like 5 or 6 )  ,  another employee came and sliced the carrot cake ,  setting the slice on the back counter with the ticket .  and then we waited .  and waited some more .  after about another 5 to 10 minutes ,  i flagged the teenager down and asked if he could box up the cake for us .  he seemed confused ,  and it took an awkward minute - long exchange for him to understand we hadn ' t yet received our order .  he did apologize for the wait ,  which i do appreciate ,  boxed up the cake ,  and then we were on our way .   i should clarify that we did not go into the shop at a busy time .  it was a relatively cool day and not many people were out .  while there were maybe 2 to 3 tables seated ,  we were the only ones at the counter ordering .  and while i ' m sure the wait staff who repeatedly walked by our lonely piece of carrot cake sitting on the back counter had many important tasks .  .  . i just wanted to eat my  $ 10 cake .   four stars for the cake .  two stars for the service .

(  $ 1 . 60 )     - the restaurants are expensive and they don ' t have any local appeal .  when i ' m traveling ,  i want to eat local fare .  why isn ' t there southern food ,  bbq ?     - i feel like they basically want you to stay on their property the entire time !     - expensive !  i didn ' t have to pay for my room  ( thank god )  but if i had to i couldn ' t afford to .    all in all ,  i had a great time in nashville .  .  . but having stayed here i spent way more money on transportation then i thought i would .   this place is definitely worth checking out but i would skip staying here .

    "text": "i would actually say 3 1 / 2 .  wish this place was still byo ,  but things change .  it always helps when you serve sarcone ' s bread ,  and certainly you will not leave here wanting more .  the portions are very large ,  the calamari was enough for 2 or maybe 3 .  it came out hot ,  not greasy or chewy .  the salads are also large ,  but the dressing was a bit much for my taste .  the pasta was cooked al dente ,  and the veal was tender .  sauces for both dishes were spicy and plentiful .  that being said ,  there are a couple drawbacks to this place .  if the weather permits ,  you are much better sitting outside ,  since its crowded and quite loud inside .  while the food is above an average italian restaurant ,  it seemed like they lay on the cheese and sauces a bit heavy .  yes ,  it ' s nice they give you a lemoncello shot after dinner ,  and the service was friendly ,  even though they were crowded .  i would say the pasta at avalon a few blocks away is superior ,  but overall lemoncello is good and especially for families .

    "text": "conceptually awesome !  my wife and i popped in early friday evening for our first visit .  the environment left us feeling as though we were at a  beach bar  &  restaurant .  we tried two appetizers :  grilled shrimp and smoked fish spread .  both were well prepared and delicious .  for entrees ,  emily had the grilled snapper tacos and i had the gag grouper dinner .  both meals were delicious !  the issues the exist can easily be corrected .  it is summer and this is an outdoor venue .  you order your food at a hut located behind the bar .  however ,  you have to stand in the hot sun while ordering !  a canopy needs to be installed .  there is no pricing listed anywhere so you order and then get surprised by what you are asked to pay .  what we ordered was well worth what we paid but it would be nice to know what you are spending before you order .  the only menu is a series of high - end cocktails all of which sound delicious .  however ,  the bartenders are not adept and creating these wonderful concoctions .  so the delivery is not as great as the written word .  suggestion ,  cocktail napkins or coasters  ( they won ' t blow away )  and ice .  alcohol melts the ice so load the glass up because the florida summer heat melts the ice also .  the plastic wear is fine and works well enough but the little piece of paper in the package is not sufficient to be called a napkin .  serve and extra  \" real \"  napkin with the utensils .  one thing for sure we will be back but at this price point ,  a few additional steps need to be taken by management and crew .  ps :  your  \" rocking \"  your idea morgan  -  smile and look less stressed  ( even if you are )  .  cheers , ",

    "text": "so my husband and i were both in the mood for some steak after some light shopping inside the mall .  so here is my experience .  .  .  entering the steakhouse is as is if you ' re entering a secret club ,  not a lot of decor but just enough .  we were greeted by christopher who proceeded to seat us .  our waitress came by shortly after and took our beverage order which consisted of pellegrino ,  a morton ' s champagne cocktail ,  and a gin  &  tonic .  nothing amazing or out of the ordinary .  we ordered a wedge salad with thousand island dressing and a caeser salad and a large round of bread that was topped . with onions was brought out to us .  so far so good .   entrees .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . center cut ribeyes ,  creamed spinach and sauteed brussels sprouts .  now for being a steakhouse i personally don ' t feel that the steak was up to par .  in my opinion the steak was pretty generic and nothing too memorable ,  creamed spinach was good but the brussels sprouts were lackluster .  not enough seasoning on them and there was a textural inconsistency that my husband and i continue to argue about since the sprouts he bit into were overcooked while i had overcooked and perfectly cooked .  the plating was generic as well .  your basic run of the mill off white oval plate for the steak and a twig of what i believe to be an herb of some sort but don ' t quote me on it because i can ' t be too sure .  the desert was the hot chocolate cake which is basically a lava cake along with coffee .  the cake was quite good ,  the center was molten and the outside had a good crust to it .  .  . a crust i kind of wish would have been on my steak as well .   our waitress was great ,  very friendly ,  helpful ,  and attentive .  i have no complaints about the service what so ever my issue was with the steak and brussels sprouts .  flavorless and inconsistent .  not sure if my husband or i would return to this location but we are willing to give morton ' s another shot ,  maybe they were just having an off day or maybe this location needs some improvement .  either way for the amount of money spent i personally believe they need to step it up .

    "text": "food is good .  much better than the average americanized thai .  they got a different twist on the food which makes it original yet authentic .  as opposed to other reviews i actually enjoyed the tom - yum .  it ' s different than any tom - yum i ate in thailand but still good .  i also tried the the red curry and some other entrees .  all were good .  some very good .  never mind - blowing though .   now the reason i decided to give it 3 stars is because at the end of the day the food lacks in the bang - for - the - buck department .  the portions always seem a little too small and more than a little expensive .  for a soup and an entree you ' ll pay over  $ 20 after taxes ,  and you ' re not very likely to have any leftovers .  the rice container for the take - out was as small as i ' ve ever seen in any other asian restaurant i ' ve ever gotten food from .   i live close - by so i ' ll be back ,  but not nearly as often as i would like to ,  unless one of the following happens :  the food gets exceptional ,  the prices drop or the portions get bigger .  the restaurant needs to work on giving a more generous air and not feel just a tiny bit stingy .

    "text": "tried this placed based on yelp reviews .   beef brisket  /  tendon noodle soup was as most reviewers report  -  delicious .   pancake wrapped pork was a new dish to us ,  and very good as well .   we also had mango and blueberry fruit slushes  -  refreshing and tasty ,  and probably not easily found in reno .   the disappointment ,  however ,  for me was the pork chow fun .   the noodles were oily ,  yellow  ( like they were egg and not rice )  and a bit chewy versus the usual wider ,  white  \" ho fan \"  ribbon noodles .   dry fried chow fun typically has brown char marks from wok frying which provide the flavor ,  and these noodles didn ' t seem like they were fried .   a better nearby choice for chow fun ,  imho ,  would be pho mein in the el dorado .

    "text": "sorry yelpers ,  but i thought this jose garces restaurant was just okay .   village whiskey is pretty tiny .   about seven round tables that could fit maybe three people  ( might be able to fit four ,  but highly unlikely )  and some room at the bar .   came for lunch at 11 : 30am when they opened ,  and by about 12 : 15pm ,  all the tables and most of the seats at the bar were taken .     we were the second group to be seated ,  and although there was no one else in the restaurant at the time ,  our waitress seemed to be preoccupied after taking our order .   she knew we were still deciding on drinks ,  so why didn ' t she check on us again ?   hello !   she wasn ' t very attentive and seemed like she would rather be elsewhere .   i ordered the village burger  ( an 8 ounce burger on a sesame roll with boston bibb lettuce ,  tomato ,  and house - made thousand island dressing :   $ 11 )  and added jasper hill cheddar cheese  (  $ 3 . 50 )  and fried egg  (  $ 1 . 50 )  .   perfect brunch meal right ?   eh .   was just okay .   the burger wasn ' t anything spectacular ,  definitely not anything to rave about .   it was juicy ,  but lacked flavor .   usually the bun makes the burger  ( for me at least )  ,  and i thought the sesame roll was okay .   tasted like an everyday burger bun to me .   the cheddar cheese and fried egg were a nice additional to the burger .   at 8 ounces ,  this burger is pretty huge !   could definitely serve as another meal or late night snack .   http :  /  / www . yelp . com / biz_photos / etksthv5qx_q7aur9o4kqq ? select=qz4yn47tlprqlbcrwmtzdw  we also ordered the duck fat french fries with sly - fox cheddar sauce  (  $ 7 )  to share .   i ' ve always always wanted to try duck fat fries .   these left me wanting more .   really .  .  . is this what they really taste like ?   i hope not .   these fries were more soggy than crispy ,  and left a weird after taste in my mouth .   the cheddar sauce was a welcomed additional ,  but not necessary .   the sauce would have been better if it was hotter .     when our waitress finally came back with our food ,  we were able to order the irish car bomb shake  (  $ 9 )  .   ours definitely didn ' t look like a lot of the pictures that were posted on yelp .   for  $ 9 ,  this shake better be spectacular !   again ,  it was just okay .   i did enjoy those chunks of brownie pieces though !  http :  /  / www . yelp . com / biz_photos / etksthv5qx_q7aur9o4kqq ? select=ebqjlid6pkw7u1kgfvmjaa  rg ordered the whiskey king  ( an 8 ounce burger on a sesame roll with maple bourbon glazed ciopollini ,  rogue bleu cheese ,  applewood bacon ,  and foie gras -  $ 26 )  .   massive burger .   the bleu cheese was almost non - existent .   i tried a bite ,  and the foie gras was pretty good .   the applewood bacon was a nice touch .   but again ,  the burger was just okay .     fyi - don ' t look up at the ceiling fans ,  they were so filled with dirt ,  that you might get dust in your eyes !

( it ' s  $ 1 to sub in fries )  .  we also ordered fried pickles ,  they were kind of bland ,  and doughy  ( i think the frier wasn ' t hot enough or they weren ' t swimming in there long enough )  .  the sauce they came with was also kind of weird and too sweet .    the craft beer selection is decent but there are no prices listed on the board -  - and for a good reason .  they are entirely too expensive ,  even for nolibs .    i will probably stop back in another time to try out a cocktail and a few other menu items .  maybe i ' ll even catch a show .  b & b has a lot of potential but i ' m not hooked yet .

    "text": "so ,  i ' m in nashville for the weekend with friends and we were looking up places to go to for breakfast in the area .  i had already heard about the famous pancake pantry and it ended up being the first place that came up when searching for breakfast in nashville ,  tn .  so ,  we figured ,  what the hell ,  let ' s try this place .  .  .   we arrived only to find a very large line of people waiting in the hot sun for a nice table to be ready .  as we were not prepared to do this at this time ,  we left ,  to another restaurant .   day 2 :  we arrived again ,  only to find another very large line .  .  .   day 3 :  we arrived once again ,  and again found a line ,  but said we need to eat here because it must be absolutely amazing if all these people wait in line every day .    in line we went  ( group of 8 )  and waited for approximately 25 minutes to be seated .  once we got in ,  we ordered and waited patiently for our food .  i ordered the chopped ham in scrambled eggs .  somehow ,  i pictured there would actually be chopped ham in the eggs ,  but no .  .  .  it was served in rectangular - diced pieces just above the eggs .  the pancakes were served on the same plate as everything else .  i personally like syrup on my pancakes but don ' t like it on my eggs .  thankfully ,  there was an extra plate on the table and i used that .    my review :  the food was good ,  but i wouldn ' t say it was great .  then again ,  maybe i should have tried some of the other pancakes .  i got a bite from the sweet potato pancakes and those were pretty swell .  all in all ,  just a really long wait ,  which is really not good when you ' re hungry .  also ,  waiting to pay at the counter on the way out ,  not good .

    "text": "i really want to leave two reviews ,  one for the service and ambience and one for the food .   the service was fantastic .  we were having a very small wedding shower at the restaurant and the server and manager couldn ' t have been nicer .  they accommodated my request for dessert and were very attentive to our needs the who , e time we were there .  ralph ' s is a great place for things like this .  they have rooms you can use for more privacy but with only 8 people the main restaurant was perfect .  our waiter was quite content letting us sit and open the few presents we had and we never once felt rushed to get up from our table .  very fun atmosphere and wonderful staff .  now the food .   the majority of the table had the crawfish benedict .  this dish is exactly as the name implies .  this dish should have been outstanding .  tangy hollandaise and spicy crawfish on one of their delicious biscuits .  sadly it was not .  first of all the food was barely warm ,  bordering on cold .  the grilled veggies ,  which were the side ,  were cold .  there was no seasoning whatsoever on the crawfish and the hollandaise had no taste at all .  i was really disappointed .  the corned beef hash was warm and the small bite i had was good .  it ' s not your typical hash .  the corned beef were cubes of corned beef not shredded like in a hash .  that didn ' t make it any better or worse just different .  their biscuits were delicious .  warm and flaky and with just that hint of saltiness that makes for the best biscuits .  they were light and fluffy and even though they looked as if they might be dense they were not .  i wish i had just ordered a plate of biscuits for my brunch .  the bottomless mimosas were well ladled with champagne and they were definitely not stingy with the refills .  my glass was always full .  if your a coffee drinkers ,  they serve a french press ,  not just a cup .  i had decaf and was not impressed with it .  it was very bitter and no amount of cream could help it .  i would have preferred just a good old cup of new orleans java .  no need to serve fancy french press when you already have some of the best coffee .

    "text": "needing to run an errand in moorestown during my lunch break ,  i figured i would pickup lunch while in town ,  too .   i did a quick google search before leaving the office  ( no yelp access at work )  and came across the cubby hole .   looked like a pretty good lunch spot ,  so to the cubby hole i went .    the caf\u00e9 is small ,  but quaint ,  in typical moorestown fashion .   the girl behind the counter handed me a menu and also directed me to their specials board .  i felt that their menu was a little lacking in vegetarian selections .   the only cold sandwich option was egg salad  ( which they were out of today )  ,  and the hot selections were basically variations of grilled cheese .  no vegetarian selections on the specials board either .   i could have gone for like a grilled veggie panini .     no worries ,  though .   i ordered a mozzarella ,  tomato ,  and balsamic panini .   i went to run my errand while i waited for my lunch to be prepared .   i also had to stop at an atm because i learned when i got there that they take cash only .   i ran my errand ,  picked up my lunch ,  and went back to the office .     by the time i got back to the office ,  my panini was still warm ,  and was really good .  the balsamic vinegar gave it a nice flavor ,  and the tomatoes were fresh .   the panini was grilled just perfectly .   i give the cubby hole 3 stars ,  a - ok .   they definitely lose a star for being cash only .   i never carry cash .   also ,  i ' d like to see a more extensive menu for vegetarians .   that said ,  i would definitely come here again when i ' m in town .

    "text": "let ' s see .  . where to start .  .  . to begin with there was a line outside .  today was a cold breezy yet sunny day ,  so it was somewhat bearable to wait outside .  there was a 25 - 30 min wait ,  which i endured because my friend wanted to really try it .  honestly ,  i get real leary when i see lines outside of certain restaurants ,  especially in houston and new orleans because i have learned that it ' s not always about the hype .  with so many eateries in places like new orleans and houston ,  it ' s hard for me to actually wait in a long line .  there have been times that i have seen the long lines for restaurants ,  and the food was subpar -  this was one of those occasions .  for starters ,  the host was welcoming ,  and the other waitresses seemed friendly ,  but not ours .  let ' s call her  \" marie .  \"  marie ,  seemed like the classic example of trying to help a meth head out and give them a job .  she was unattentive ,  rude and lack of understanding .  first ,  we asked what were the choices for the  \" entree  +  two sides options ,  \"  on the menu and she started listing the sides .  i asked her if there was a menu to read what the sides are ,  and she said that was the list .  ok .  before we could ask anything else she drifted off somewhere else and we had to bring her back .  basically ,  you ' re kinda forced to get the buffet option because if she get the entree you ' re limited to what you can get even though other food choices are available on the buffet .  bright side ,  if you go with the buffet you will get a chance to sample some of their popular items .   moving on ,  we got our tea which was phenomenal .  i ' d say crack tea because it was hard to just not keep drinking it .  aside from that ,  i got the fried chicken ,  green beans ,  gumbo and stuffed bell peppers .  you also get the choice of an omelette or french toast - tried the french toast as well .  once we got our drinks and started eating -  ol marie went missing for awhile .  we needed refills ,  napkins ,  and clearing our table of empty plates ,   but she was nowhere to be found .  other waiters had to step in to clear our table .  we were getting ready to leave but wanted more tea ,  so we asked if we could get a refill , and she just walked off without acknowledging if she heard us or not .  we also wanted to know if we could get it to go .  then all of a sudden she reapppeared pouring tea which she sloppily wasted on the table and my purse - no words or apology .  i told her we were trying to inform her that we wanted them to go and the bill split ,  but yet again she walked off without acknowledging if she heard everything .  she returned with plastic cups .  the cups were dusty to the point you could wipe your finger over and see the residue -  no thank you .  marie also brought back the bill without it being split as we asked .  when we reminded her of our request ,  she rudely replied  \" we dont split checks but you could simply divide it .  \"  boyyy it took everything in me not to go off .  i told her  \" we ' re fully aware of how to do math ,  however we asked for separate bills in which you never told us that it was a policy to not separate the tab .  \"  at this point the owner nearby could see our frustration and his as well ,  in which he told her  \" all you have to is seperate it out ,  no big deal .  \"  this was too confusing for ms .  marie ,  in which the owner had to further explain .  eventually she just took three seperate payments .  smh .   overall ,  the food and experience was  \" ok .  \"  i had to add some salt and pepper to some of my food ,  which is a red flag considering it seems to be a well known nola spot .  honestly ,  the fried chicken from willie ' s was waaaay better .  can ' t say i ' d return ,  but i can cross this off my list .

( i often wonder why the server hasn ' t noticed that we haven ' t even opened our menus yet .  )   the food was pretty good ,  pasta bolognaise and a salad to start .  but my criticism is this ,  which i hope the owners read  &  heed :  we were at an outside table and it was a lovely evening .  the sun had set and there was plenty of light thanks to the street lights in the borough ,  but at some point they threw on the overhead spotlights which was an immediate rude awakening .  the table of females behind us gasped collectively as well and actually screamed when the burst of light brought bugs to our tables and specifically a beetle into the hair of one of them .  and what seemed worse was that when we all asked that they kill the offensive lighting ,  the answer twice was that they didn ' t want to  \" appear closed \"  to potential customers .  not only was this strange because clearly with people inside and out at tables eating it appeared quite open but it was annoying because the focus was more on the would - be customer rather than their actual customers  ( who were now unwitting participants in their marketing scheme )  .

    "text": "i came here to eat dinner tonight and i was not impressed at all .   first off ,  the waiter was going through the menu with me telling me where i should order .   i didn ' t even get a chance to look at the menu nor did i ask him for help which i thought was odd .   i felt i was being forced to order from their dinner menu .   i politely thanked him and proceeded to order what i wanted to order .   my husband ordered the wanton noodles with duck .   the reason for the 3 stars is because the wantons were amazing .   the broth was so bland though which was a bummer .   i ordered the baked pork chop with fried rice .   it ' s kind of strange because it ' s pieces of pork chops with spaghetti sauce baked with cheese over rice .   seriously i could have done without the spaghetti sauce .   a very odd mix .   i think they should have written that in their description .   the soft shell crab was definitely plentiful but it just tasted strange to me .   it seems like they mixed peanut butter in their batter .   it ' s really dark in color and did not taste right .   i hate leaving bad reviews so i may try them out once more to update my review in the future .

    "text": "fun fact ,  i  \" recently \"  moved somewhat close to the  \" hill \"  .  in fact ,  on the day that i finally found my apartment ,  my parents and i were driving down the road and stumbled upon a building adorned with a big ,  red ,  flashing sign - it read ,   \" joey b ' s on the hill .  \"  since we were famished from all of the decision making ,  we decided to give it a whirl .   now ,  joey b ' s is not quite located in the same area as the rest of the hill restaurants ,  so i was anxious to see what it was like - most of the others are sit down ,  semi - nice ,  lit by the light of 1 , 000 candles types of places .  you know ,  your typical italian joint -  - checkered table clothes and all .   joey b ' s was a little different as it looked a little more like a sports bar than most other places on the hill -  - fewer candles ,  more big screen tvs .  [of course ,  my father was extraordinarily pleased that he could watch the nascar race while we ate ,  so it was all good . ]  after looking over the menu ,  my mom decided to order the french dip and my dad and i decided to split a pizza - half supreme ,  half bbq chicken .  that ' s half sausage ,  pepperoni ,  bacon ,  mushroom ,  green pepper  &  onion and half grilled chicken ,  red onion and provel cheese with bbq sauce .  let ' s just be honest .  this was a mistake .  and the mistake was my fault .  i was the one who ordered the bbq half of the pizza and it just did not hold a candle to the  \" regular \"  half of the pizza .   yes ,  i ' ll admit that for once in my life a pizza with provel cheese on it -  - impressed me .  i didn ' t expect that !  but ,  the bbq pizza was too sweet and i ' m sad to say that we didn ' t eat much of it .   luckily ,  my dad let me have a little of his and i was so glad he did ,  because his half of the pizza was much better than mine .   the pizza had a nice crunchy crust ,  but it didn ' t crumble and fall apart like some thin crusts can .  plus ,  the sauce was really good .  nice and tangy .  in fact ,  i believe that the menu said that this was rachel ray ' s favorite pizza sauce -  - and who can argue with that ?   all in all ,  it was just good pizza .  no ,  not the  * best *  i ' d ever had ,  but good .  plus ,  it was pretty big too - definitely enough to share .  so either go in expecting left overs or take a big appetite .   now that we ' ve talked pizza ,  let ' s talk about the [unexpected] best part of the meal .  my mom ' s french dip sandwich .   thin ,  juicy ,  sliced roast beef served with its own au jus and melted provel cheese on french bread .  this sandwich was very moist and very flavorful .  i would have to describe it as comfort food .  .  .  to the point where i am seriously look forward to going there in the winter and having one .   plus ,  once again ,  i ' m proud to say that i enjoyed the provel cheese on this dish !   * gasp !  *  maybe st .  louis is stealing my soul .  .  .  .  or maybe joey b ' s just knows how to use juuuustttt enough provel to bring the flavor palette in without overwhelming the taste buds .  yeah ,  i ' ll go with the second option .   other menu items that we selected included onion rings  ( very heavily breaded ,  but pretty good .  .  .  your standard onion rings )  and side salads  ( again ,  the provel cheese was good on these salads .  shocking !  )  .  it was all just very satisfying ;  a nice hearty ,  savory meal .   so ,  what ' s the final judgement ?  the food was good  ( and partially changed my mind about provel cheese )  ,  the service friendly ,  and the atmosphere upbeat but not super exciting .  i ' d have to grade joey b ' s like this :   food :  a -  atmosphere :  b service :  a price :   $  portion size :  large  it truly seemed like a great place to grab a pizza and a couple beers and hang out with your friends .  i definitely plan on returning and you should check it out too .  let me know what you think when you go !   happy eating !

    "text": "i guess i ' m listed as a  \" picky \"  reviewer on yelp ,  but this place could be 4 stars if they would address the service problems .  walked in at 7 : 30 ,  gave the name and waited .  soon there were over a dozen people standing in the waiting area for tables .  after 15 minutes the lady i gave my name to came over and asked what the name was again .  i asked if we could sit at the 2 top that had been vacant since we walked in and she looked at the empty table and said sure .  ok ,  but why couldn ' t we be seated before that ?  ?  ?  i do want to add that in between taking names ,  she was answering the phone ,  pouring coffee ,  ringing up checks and bussing tables .  this place sorely needs a host or hostess .  the couple that came in right behind us waited over 20 minutes to be seated ,  and there was another 2 top open behind us .  i don ' t get it .  anyway ,  the waiter came by ,  opened the wine and told us about the specials .  i guess its picky if you want the wine opened and then given a few minutes to relax before hearing the specials .  anyway ,  another man came by several minutes later and asked if we were told the specials .  we asked for a few minutes and he was very nice and said sure no problem .  i will get to the food ,  but you have to read what else took place to understand why they need someone to co - ordinate the staff .  a waitress brought the appetizers and when we were almost done ,  yet another waitress brought us bread with dipping sauce .  been nice to get the bread first .  the dinner was brought out by a different waitress .  at the end of the meal the a waitress brought by the dessert cart  ,  which we passed on .  the original waiter stopped by to ask about dessert ,  i said no thanks ,  but we would like the check .  in between we kept trying to get someone ' s attention because we had asked to take part of an entree home .  the waiter was way to busy and basically blew us off ,  one of the waitress '  also passed by ,  but we couldn ' t get her to stop .  finally the man that seemed to be the manager came by and he took care of it .  ok ,  that ' s the bad news and maybe they were shorthanded  ,  but a lot of other yelpers note the same problem with service issues .  people shouldn ' t have to sit and wait 15 - 30 minutes for a table .  if this wasn ' t byo ,  then you could always go sit at a bar and have a drink .  the other thing is ,  no one offered to open the wine while we were waiting , as many byo ' s will do if they can ' t seat you on time .  nor ,  did anyone say sorry about the wait .  the food was very good ,  even as picky as i am .  the shrimp tempura was serving of 5 very large gulf shrimp atop a very flavorful asain slaw .  the duo ,  which consists of a crabcake slider and a sirloin slider was great .  the crabcake was moist and had ample pieces of lump crabmeat .  the sirloin slider was excellent ,  could of eaten a lot of those .  the entree ' s were also top notch .  the special grouper with beans and crab was moist ,  cooked perfectly and had a nice red pepper sauce on the bottom .  as most of the reviews talk about here ,  the lobster ravioli is as good as anywhere in this area .  the pasta was light ,  the ravioli was stuffed with lobster meat and the sauce was great .  like i said ,  take care of the service and seating issues and this is a 4 star .  they do have their own lot ,  but you probably will have to park across the street if it ' s a weened night .  i was glad i put this address in the nav system because at night and the first time there it ' s a little hard to find .  will give them another try in hopes the service improves .

    "text": "food is good ,  manager is great ,  kitchen timing needs work .   3 of 5 dishes  ( 2 lasagna ,  2 ravioli and 1 chick fettuccine )  came out then we waited 4 minutes for another lasagna and the capalini and meatball .  the kitchen is that small they can ' t time the dishes to come out .  sure it ' s italian ,   \" mangia mangia \"  ,  so you don ' t need to wait for others but the we usually do so food gets cold .   that said ,  the food was very good .  i love to try the variety of lasagna in santa barbara .  the largest portion ,  but not the best is from arnoldi ' s cafe ,  trattoria vittoria when it ' s done with lamb ,  is my favorite but a big round of applause for tre lune .  the bechamel sauce was great and as mentioned ,  i ' m a sucker for lamb ragu .  this is the dish to beat .   while i ' m disappointed at the delivery  ( minus one star )  ,  the food was very good  ( 4 star )  .  i ' ll ding them today but certainly return for more lasagna .  you ' ve won my heart over trattoria ,  and that ' s hard to do .

    "text": "i went in as a fan of chicago - style pizza ,  which 312 advertises itself as specializing in .   maybe i ' m not fully versed in the details of chicago - style ,  but i was slightly disappointed in a few details .   first ,  however ,  the ambiance and service were great .   i arrived about 6pm on a tuesday and found a place to park right on the street outside .   my waitress was charming and attentive ,  so no problems there .   i ordered a deep - dish 10 \"  cheese  &  pepperoni ,  expecting to eat half there and take the other half home .   my waitress warned me they take a while to cook  -  app .  45 minutes .   which it did .  good thing i wasn ' t starving .   when the pizza came ,  there was plenty ,  but the sauce .  .  . oh ,  the sauce !   tomato sauce dripping from every conceivable spot on the pizza ,  overwhelming the taste of the cheese and even the pepperoni .   and the crust was surprisingly hard ,  as if overdone .   but it was definitely thick with cheese and definitely filling .   i still have yet to eat my leftovers so my opinion may change slightly ,  but i doubt i ' ll be coming back .   oh ,  and the price  -   $ 20 for a 10 \"  one - topping pizza .   i bit the bullet because it sounded so good ,  but my total bill was almost  $ 30 and definitely not worth what i got .   update :  apologies for getting a couple of factual items incorrect .   i went back and re - looked at the online menu to get my facts straight .   it was indeed a 12 \"  pizza ,  and the price was  $ 17 .   with an iced tea ,  tax ,  and tip my total bill came to right about  $ 30 .   probably not out of line ,  but less than satisfied with final product as indicated above .  i apologize for any mischaracterization of the value .

    "text": "it ' s more of a solid 3 . 5 stars .   this was our first time at the jersey location .   it was very spacious ,  clean ,  and empty .   well ,  it was a tuesday night and there were only about 4 other patrons there ;  we had the whole back room to ourselves .   we ordered quite a bit for two .   we started with scallion pancakes ,  meh i ' ve had better .   it was nothing special .   the guy had the spicy beef noodle soup ,  beef was braised as well .   the broth was delicious and spiciness level was a 5 .   when he asked the waiter if the size was comparable to pho the waiter did not have a clue to what pho was .   you work in an asian resto my dude !   granted this is not a viet joint ,  but you should be well rounded about asian cuisine overall .   anyway ,  the dan dan noodle is a staple when dining at han ' s ,  the spiciness level was a 6 and they accommodated me by not adding meat to it .   i also ordered the spicy cucumber ,  spiciness level was a 6 .   after one helping i was over it .   the garlic overpowered the rest of the flavosr as i kept munching on it .   my eyes locked in on the salt and pepper shrimp entree so i had to order it .   i love this dish .   the minced pepper and onion just heightens the flavor of the shrimp .   shame that it was on the pricey side ,   $ 19 . 95 .   i think there were only about 10 pieces of shrimps .   the guy had a chicken entree that he liked ,  nothing special .   we ended up having leftovers cause we wanted to try different things .   i think next time i ' ll just stick to the lunch menu or take out .

'  our server didn ' t come by ,  but juan the kitchen manager came over and asked me how he could help .  he took the dish back to the kitchen ,  mixed in some red sauce and gave me more on the side .  then ,  blake ,  a floor manager and seems he was serving at the bar too ,  came by to talk to us .  he was pleasant enough too .  now ,  i think rebecca was flustered and didn ' t come by until after that ,  she asked me if i was being taken care of and that the kitchen ,  juan took care of the mixed up order .  yea ,  it was ,  but this should have been her job .  rebecca seems like a nice woman ,  maybe she just needs to understand what  ' vegan '  entails .  some of us have to eat this way ,  not just because it a choice ,  but because it ' s about health concerns .  and ,  we still want to go out and eat with our friends .   i don ' t know if it was the kitchen or the server that made the mistake ,  but you would have thought that with such a harsh start to the meal ,  then a let down in the middle ,  a discount or coupon would have been offered .  .  .  .  . nothing !  so ,  while we made due ;  the mess was undone by my standards .  i am grateful for the effort ,  and i would try the food chain restaurant again ,  but i ' ll be even more clear on my menu choices and options .  also ,  it might be wise for this chain to offer at least a couple of vegan options hot and cold ,  that are not just appetizers .  i ' ll say this about juan and blake ,  they did their best and went out of the way to make me feel comfortable and welcomed .  that ' s a good way to get repeat business .  next time ,  offer the customer a  $ 50 . 00 coupon ,  that ' s a way to secure that repeat business .  it doesn ' t need to be for me ,  just anyone that feels a bit upside down on the menu and service .  lol",

( please see pic )  the bread sticks were decent .  just seemed like the pizza crust with cheese .  overall my experience was o - k or decent .  i will be back to try the gluten free as i am trying trying !  to not eat wheat !

    "text": "i ' ve always liked this on the border .  .  .  it ' s like chi chi ' s on don pablo ' s ,  with one major difference  -  the food is really delicious !   it ' s like every other mexican chain restaurant in terms of menu choices ,  decor ,  and presentation ,  but something about the way everything tastes just makes them a cut above the rest .     we ' ve also always had really great service every time ,  so kudos to whoever does the hiring in there .   now on to the reason they ' re only getting 3 stars .  .  .  up until recently ,  they gave you the option to build your own burrito .   every table was equipped with a pad of paper with all types of burrito choices on it for you to fill out however you want ,  and you would then hand it to your waiter and be presented with your perfect burrito shortly thereafter ,  no ifs ands or buts .   in my opinion ,  probably the best thing they had going for them was this build your own burrito note pad .   boyfriend and i went there monday night and were devastated to learn that in addition to the menu changes mentioned by the previous yelper ,  the build your own burrito option is now no more .     bad move ,  otb .   bad move .   i got enchiladas instead ,  and they were delicious .   but something about filling out check boxes and having full control over what ' s being put on my plate will be very sorely missed .

    "text": "easily the most elegant grocery store in reno ,  the items sold at whole foods are seriously overpriced .   that ' s fine if you are good with giving money away ,  but i ' m just not that philanthropic when it comes to supporting a corporation .   while i understand the desire to get  \" organic \"  with it ,  between wolf pack meats ,  trader joes ,  raley ' s and great basin co - op ,  there aren ' t many items available here  that aren ' t available for 20 - 40 %  less somewhere else .   however ,  it ' s so relaxing to walk the broad ,  beautifully displayed aisles that i ' m sometimes almost glad this store is the only purveyor of my favorite shampoo .  it costs me about  $ 30 to lay in an 8 month supply  -  -  coincidentally ,  the same time interval between my visits to this store .   each time ,  the excellent displays beckon and the gently helpful staff members rave about something new i ' ve never tried ,  and i end up spending another  $ 30 on stuff i really don ' t need !   i give whole foods credit for having the most extensive selection of teas available at any grocery store ,  so i ' ve made an unscheduled trip or two just to buy tea .  the catch ?  if you buy one of the teas that is available locally elsewhere ,  get ready to fork out fiftty cents to a dollar more per package to buy it here .   damn you whole foods !  you are a bunch of robber barons .  whole foods ought to create an ira account for each of its regular shoppers because that ' s the only way they ' ll have any money left to retire with after shopping here .

    "text": "during the 80s as a child my family used to go to micha ' s fairly often .  once i was on my own i didn ' t return for any particular reason .  i always liked it and remember the food being very good with a decent atmosphere too .    after a very long hiatus ,  i decided on whim to return with my own family .  the atmosphere was still good ,  although the place was slightly worn around the edges in a good way .  that ' s to be expected after almost a quarter of a century .  it ' s a casual family place ,  not a fine dining establishment .   the food was still very good ,  maybe not quite up to par with what i remembered ,  but i don ' t know if that is just an artifact of memory or actual reality .  we were served with only one bowl of tortilla chips with no refills offered .  i don ' t know if refills cost extra ,  or if it was just laxness on our server ' s part .  the chips were fresh and decent ,  but some weren ' t warm .  the salsa was very good .  i ordered the  # 17 combination plate ,  in which i had a red chili chimichanga along with refried beans and rice .  the red chili had tender cubes of beef in a savory red chili sauce .  at some mexican restaurants the red chili sauce has a somewhat bland taste marred with a texture that is too thick presumably due to too much flour as a thickening agent .  not a micha ' s as the sauce had just the right amount of thickness .  going overboard with red chili sauce ,  i ordered my chimi enchilada style ,  and it was very good and covered with melted cheddar cheese .  the chimi itself was perfectly crisp on the outside with more of a non - fried flour tortilla texture on the inside ,  which is good but slightly different than the usual chimichangas in the area as they are more crispy throughout the tortilla wrapping .  the refried bean were very flavorful and covered with melted cheese also .  the rice was tasty ,  but it lukewarm and had a few cold clumps in it ,  so i would only say it was only fair .  my wife had a carne asada burrito .  it was good ,  but it was pretty dry and lacked the amount of onions and tomatoes that other places typically have .  to counteract the dryness she ordered a side of guacamole ,  which also was a little atypical .  the guacamole had a lot of onions ,  but the unusual part was that it also had some cottage cheese mixed in .  unusual ,  but good .  one of my sons got a bean chimichanga ,  which was like mine in that it was crispy on the outside ,  but less so than other places on the inside .  he liked it a lot .  my other son ordered a machaca taco ,  chicken enchilada and rice .  his plate looked good ,  and he said it was great .    the service was good but not great .  our server was for the most part all business and not overly friendly .  the bus boy was very friendly ,  however .   i would go back again .  my kids loved it ,  and i thought it was good ,  but my wife was only partially impressed .  so it won ' t be a place that we would frequent with any regularity ,  but i wouldn ' t hesitate to go again",

    "text": "so ,  i had a craving for a slinger and used yelp to help find a local place to get one ,  leading me to george rivolo ' s diner .  i walked in and was amazed at how small the place was .  i counted around 15 seats total .  the seats were a bit worn down and could have definitely used some cushions  ( i actually did hurt my butt sitting down on those things )  .  i browsed through the menu ,  found my singer  ( and was disappointed at the up charge to have meat in it )  .  so i watched as the lady behind the counter made my food .   while waiting i have to point out how immaculately clean the kitchen was .  having worked in several restaurants i know how much work it takes to keep a kitchen as spotless as this place was and i have to say that alone impressed me and told me that the people who own this place care .    once i got my food i figured ,   \" yep .  .  .  that ' s a slinger \"  .  i was slightly disappointed that there wasn ' t more chili on it ,  and i felt that the chili and burger meat could have done with some seasoning .  however that being said ,  it was okay for diner food .  not something i ' d go out of my way for ,  but not something i ' d avoid either .  if the owner took the time to add a bit more flavor to the food this would be a place worth visiting regularly for me .  as it stands though ,  i can ' t really give high recommendation for this place unless you are already in the neighborhood and craving some diner food .

    "text": "i ' ve been wanting to come here for quite sometime and i finally dragged the boyfriend here for dinner tonight .  upon entering ,  i noticed the decor was quite modern and clean in appearance ,  but felt very crowded as they were trying to fit too many tables into a small space .  i looked up the menu online before hand to get an idea of what they offer .  they had a variety of options including all you can eat sushi and hibachi  ( 17 . 95 for adults )  or you can order a la carte for various maki and signature rolls as well as hibachi ,  apps ,  teriyaki ,  etc .  however ,  when we were seated they only gave us the all you can eat menu .  i chose to walk out as i knew i could not eat enough to make it worth the money on this particular evening .  that ' s when they informed me that they had an a la carte menu .  i wish they had presented it up front upon seating us ,  seemed like they want people to just order from the unlimited menu ,  so they hide the ala carte menu behind the hostess stand .    regardless ,  we decided to stay and give it a shot .  the prices were very reasonable for the a la carte  (  $ 3 - 4 for plain and simple rolls ,   $ 8 - 10 for signature )  ,  but it was reflected in the quality and presentation of the food to a certain extent .  we chose the mexican ,  california ,  spicy tuna and rock  ' n roll .  all were good in my opinion except the spicy tuna which was the most boring roll of my life  ( even more yawn worthy than california )  .  normally a spicy tuna has some extra toppings or pizzazz on top ,  but this was totally plain .  meh .  it was also a bit mushy .  not good for someone like myself who enjoys crunchy and crispy sushi .  besides that all other rolls were decent .  the bf doesn ' t eat sushi often ,  but can appreciate it once in a while .  he thought this sushi was 3 / 10 ,  based on the thick double layer of rice on each roll as well as simplicity of some of the rolls .  in my opinion it was more like a 6 / 10 ,  hence my  \" a - ok \"  3 star review .   overall ,  the concept is good for those who can eat ,  eat and eat some more .  however for those with a smaller appetite it would be better to order a la carte if you can ' t eat at least 3 rolls .  i will likely give it another chance in the future ,  perhaps to try their 3 rolls lunch combo for  $ 9 . 99 or maybe to try some of the hibachi .

    "text": "i really want to love this place ,  but they make it so hard .  the past three times in a row i ' ve been there ,  there has been some sort of ridiculous customer service issue that left me and whoever i was with super annoyed .   starting with the good :  the coffee is delicious .  the assortment of baked goods is great .  .  . quiche is yummy ,  etc .  i ' ve always loved the space .  .  . good mixture of comfy couches and real seating where people can sit and work on laptops .  plenty of outdoor seating on nice days .   the prices are .  .  . steep .  but i always feel good about supporting a local small business ,  so whatever .  my real problem is the  ' tude and just general lack of professionalism that i ' ve seen from the baristas .  they clearly know their coffee ,  and that ' s great ,  but here are some of the more ridiculous things that have happened to me there in the past month :    -  - purchased coffee with my mom and went to add our cream and sugar .  my mom realized the half and half container was empty and gave the guy behind the counter a head ' s up .  his answer :   \" yeah ,  we ' re actually out of half and half .  \"  everyone stared blankly at him ,  including the other people in line .  now mind you ,  it was before noon ,  not five minutes before they closed .  no apology ,  no  \" i ' m so sorry ,  we sent someone down the street to the 7 - 11  ( literally down the street )  to pick some up ,  they should be back any minute .  \"  that was it .  the guy behind us asked ,   \" is anyone going to get some more ?  \"  and the kid literally shrugged his shoulders and turned his back to us .  ummmmmm .  as my mom said ,  when you charge people  $ 8 for two coffees  ( one of which was just a drip coffee )  ,  i don ' t think it ' s too much to ask that you provide half and half at your coffee shop .     -  - another time i was there ,  a friend asked for her coffee extra hot ,  and then when it arrived just warm ,  she asked if they could nuke it in the microwave for a minute .  she was very nice about it .  the girl behind the counter ,  on the other hand ,  felt it necessary to explain in a condescending tone for five minutes that they  \" actually can ' t put the coffee cups in the microwave \"  for some reason i now forget ,  and then reluctantly offered to add some hot water .  uhhhh .  homegirl .  could you maybe just take the coffee and solve the problem ?  put it in a to go cup and microwave it ?  this doesn ' t seem like that hard of a problem to solve ,  nor can i imagine it ' s the first time someone has asked for their coffee extra hot .  again ,  everyone in line sort of looked at each other helplessly as this happened .     -  - this is a small thing ,  but they have multiple sizes for every drink on their board ,  but then half of them apparently only come in one size ?  i know it ' s a small issue ,  but you ' d think it would occur to someone to change the menu so they don ' t have to keep telling people  ( last time i was there it happened to both me and the woman behind me )  .    jersey java owners ,  please give your baristas some basic lessons in customer service .  again ,  they know their coffee ,  and they ' re generally nice until there ' s any sort of minor hiccup ,  and then all basic common sense goes right out the window .  your coffee is too expensive for me to have some ordeal every time i go there .  oh ,  and buy more half and half .

    "text": "i ' m basing this review after visitig  ( or attempting to visit )  p & k several times now .   i will begin by saying that i find the layout to be pretty good with the exception of the back room .   something about dining there just makes you feel less connected to the normal energy and flow of the place .    the beer selection is small but tastefully chosen .   they always seem to have old speckled hen on tap .   i ' ve never had a problem ordering drinks even on packed bar nights .   if you ' re eating at p & k then you definitely want to have the burger .   it ' s pretty ridiculously awesome .   i ' ve had it three times now and it never disappoints me or any of the people i ' ve dragged their with me .   i ' ve had the mussels as well and they were nomtastic .   i have a feeling that all of their food is spot on and there ' s not a bad thing on the menu .   i knock them down a couple stars because times i have gone there it has either been so packed that it wasn ' t worth the wait or because one hot summer evening i tried to go there and either they weren ' t running the ac or they didn ' t have any .   needless to say ,  i had to leave .   it was just too hot in there to enjoy any food .   they don ' t take reservations which just bothers me .  for me ,  if i know where i ' m going in advance ,  i want to call and have a table reserved for me .   from the restaurant ' s standpoint i ' m sure they don ' t want to book up there tables for a bunch of no shows .   i guess it ' s just crappy because i feel that their level of food is of the quality where i should be able to reserve a table .   i will make return trips .   it ' s always a nice place to stop in .   maybe i just need to go some more .  i really want to give it more stars ,  i just can ' t right now .

    "text": "many who are familiar with celebrity chefs will recognize the name :  john besh .  a southern boy ,  besh is a well - known chef throughout the city ,  owning several restaurants .  we decided on l\u00fcke for our first dinner .  according to the website ,  it is besh '   \" homage to the grand old franco - german brasseries that once reigned in new orleans .  \"   we made reservations for 5 : 30 and we ' re greeted and seated promptly upon arrival .  our waiter was lee ,  who had been on vacation for a little while .  it showed .  more on that later .  i decided to order the nightly 3 - course pri - fixe special .  my wife decided to choose her own .  first off for me was seafood gumbo \u00e1 la creole .  the gumbo itself had good flavor ,  but some of the rice was burnt and one of the oysters had a lot of grit .   my wife ordered the shrimp bisque .  it was very flavorful and enjoyable .  with a velvety consistency .   for my entree i had the navarin d ' agneau braised lamb with gnocchi and covey rise vegetables .  i had never had braised lamb before .  it was okay ,  but needed more seasonings .  unfortunately ,  the stars of the dish were the supporting cast :  the gnocchi and vegetables .   my wife had the shrimp farci  ( with blood orange hollandaise ,  crabmeat and shrimp )  .  it was very enjoyable with the hollandaise really elevating the dish .   again ,  my meal came with 3 courses .  we were both quite satiated at this point ,  but dessert came with the meal .  the original bread pudding that came out had a hair on it .  immediately it was sent back to the kitchen .  the manager apologized ,  and brought out two new desserts !  two !  we could only pick at each of them .  the first was a  \" gateau basque \"  vanilla cake with blackberries and cr\u00e8me fraiche .  we were split on this one ;  i enjoyed it ,  while my wife thought it was kind of boring for a dessert .  the second dessert we were brought was a chocolate pot de creme .  it was very enjoyable with some chocolate pieces on top adding to the texture play .   as i mentioned earlier ,  we would come back to our waiter .  lee ,  though nice ,  would come by every 2 minutes to make sure everything was okay .  the service was thus suffocating at best .  we kept getting interrupted in the middle of our conversations due to him  \" checking up \"  on us .    the food at l\u00fcke was decent ,  nothing that made me say wow !  but it seems like a good restaurant .  perhaps the service problems we had was related to lee only ,  but it put a bad taste in our mouth for the restaurant .  maybe next time we ' re in nola ,  we ' ll give john besh another chance .

    "text": "as a vegetarian who prefers to eat gluten - free ,  i know i ' m not the easiest customer for a restaurant to please .  still ,  this place has a little room for improvement ,  so i thought i ' d mention my experiences here .   not wanting to eat meat ,  fish ,  or gluten ,  i made a meal out of half an app and a small entree .  my food was tasty :  the grilled avocado app was very good ,  though it definitely needed a light sprinkle of salt ,  and there was none on the table .  our server disappeared for such long stretches of time that i didn ' t want to wait and just ate it sans salt .  my small  ( read :  very small )  salad entree was listed as beets ,  arugula ,  cheese ,  and almonds .  i got an unexpected upgrade to pine nuts instead of almonds .  i ' m not complaining ,  but it would have been nice to be notified of changes to the dish i was ordering .    a word of advice to gluten - free customers :  after ordering i later learned that there was a risotto dish under the  \" pasta \"  section of the menu .  since i avoid most gluten ,  i didn ' t even look at the pasta .  strange that they would put a risotto dish there .  also ,  the dessert menu has many  ( three i think ?  )  gluten - free options including a gluten - free brownie sundae .  it clearly mentions gluten - free on the dessert menu .  however their main menu never once mentions gluten - free options or uses gf icons or anything .    my boyfriend ' s trout meal was disappointing .  it was served skin side up  ( a bit unusual ?  )  and said it came with potatoes and a pea puree .  his peas were whole ,  not pureed ,  and the potatoes were nearly raw .  not just al dente .  basically just off - raw .   the server was very sweet ,  but not quite as present as he could have been ,  as our water glasses went unfilled for long stretches .

    "text": "i purchased a groupon for a night stay here in a jr .  suite  &  the room was 50 %  off  &  ran  $ 200 with the discount .   i was already heading to tn to visit some family so my mom  &  i decided to use the groupon the night before i left so we ' d be close to the airport .   we had both been to the hotel in the past  ( prior to the flood )  and thought it was so gorgeous  &  we couldn ' t wait to actually stay here  &  see what the room would look like .   according to their website we were in for a real treat in our room but when we arrived that wasn ' t the case at all .     first off ,  their parking has gone up  &  is now  $ 18 per night to park in a lot that doesn ' t shuttle you  &  your luggage to the main hotel ,  you have to walk .   if you choose to valet the cost is  $ 24 per night which i have a huge issue with .  .  . the parking is outside in their own lot ,  this is not a major city like nyc where parking is limited so i feel that charging people to park  &  walk is a bit ridiculous ,  i can see charging  $ 5 / 10 for valet but charging me to park my own car  &  shlep my own bags is a slap in the face especially considering the room rates .   how are locals supposed to be patrons to the businesses inside if they have to pay that much just to park ?     the hotel itself if gorgeous but the room was pretty boring .  .  . it was a large single room with a 4 person dining table  &  2 armchairs ,  it was not at all what was explained on their website which indicated  \" our suites include a moderate - size living room and optional connecting bedrooms with endless possibilities for entertaining or for small corporate meetings \"  .   this led me to believe that we wouldn ' t be sleeping in the moderate sized living room  &  have no bedroom at all .   at no time during booking or check in was i asked how many beds i wanted  &  since i thought our suite had bedroom ( s )  i didn ' t ask  &  when we got to the room we had 1 king .   i called down to the front desk first to ask why we were put in a standard room  &  why it only had 1 bed  &  i was told  \" our jr .  suite is just 1 large room  &  you should have specified when asked how many beds you wanted \"  i replied  \" i was never asked during booking or check in what i wanted \"  i was then told  \" well ,  if you want to change to 2 beds i can transfer you to the front desk  &  you can see if they have anything available \"  and i said  \" no ,  i don ' t want the hassle i guess we can just share the bed \"  and was told  \" ok ,  sorry you are disappointed \"  .   the guest services person didn ' t offer to find out the 2 bed availability for me ,  she didn ' t offer to move us to a garden view room  ( which is still cheaper at its standard rate than the discounted rate we paid for the suite )  or offer any other solutions either  &  i was really disappointed with that .   once we got over the disappointment of our room we got dressed  &  hit the hotel to shop ,  eat ,  cocktail  &  check out the murals  &  water shows .   first off we tried to find the water show  &  weren ' t having any luck so we proceeded to shop  &  asked the woman working in one of the stores where we could find them  &  she said  \" oh ,  they aren ' t running tonight \"  so that was disappointing but we moved on to exploring the murals when we were then asked by a lovely gentleman to leave because of an event that was going on behind the closed doors of the area we were in .   after a couple hours of being at the hotel we were 0 for 4 so we decided to start drinking .  .  . we hit up fuse  &  each had 1 drink  &  our bill was  $ 19 so we moved on to dinner at jack daniels which was so good  &  reasonable priced .   i think our total bill was under  $ 40  &  we didn ' t have any drinks but we did have leftovers !  !   after dinner there was nothing left to do so we went back to the room for some shut eye which was great until we got the luxury of listening to our neighbors have sex .   after all of that i took an ambien  &  slept really well until about  7 am when i could hear people talking in the hallway  &  room doors closing one after the other .   my mom said she slept for s *  * t because of all of the noise  &  it was a shame too because the bed was so comfortable .     i ' m sure that if everything we wanted to see  &  do would have been available to us this wouldn ' t have seemed like such a let down  &  the boring room wouldn ' t have been that big of a deal but considering that we weren ' t able to do anything that was on our list i would be hesitant to stay here again unless we had an atrium room so we could at least sit on the balcony  &  people watch .     don ' t get me wrong ,  the lush greenery  &  the beautiful architecture as well as the shopping  &  food are all amazing but as a guest i left feeling pretty let down .

    "text": "i visited joey b ' s for lunch today .  my experience was just ok .  they were busy .  the waiter was friendly and helpful ,  but service was slow and our food took a long time to come out .    the decor is a tad nicer than your average sports bar ,  but the layout is fractured into several small compartments and they have flat screen tvs galore ,  but they are not positioned in a way that most of the seated folks can comfortably watch the game .    the menu consists of standard pizza ,  salad ,  sandwiches and pasta fare .   my lunch partner ordered a burger and liked it .  i ordered the tutto mare and was disappointed .  it was slopped in the bowl ,  drowning in sauce and too rich to eat more than a few bites .  the clam flavor was strong and overpowered the remainder of ingredients .  my salad was soggy and too sweet .  i know that local italian salads have a tendency to be sweet ,  but this one was seriously over the top .  prices were a little high for the quality of food .    overall ,  my experience was just ok .  i will go back if others invite me ,  but i won ' t go out of my way to eat here .    btw ,  i ' m getting bored with the argument about provel cheese .  it is a local favorite .  every area around the country has a  \" cheese \"  that ' s typically used ,  and here it is provel .  giving a restaurant 1 - star because they serve a local favorite is ridiculous .  also ,  just because you ' ve  \" been around \"  doesn ' t mean you are a cheese expert .  i ' ve been around the world and most of the states in this great country and the argument can be made that most of the cheese available today isn ' t real .  if you don ' t like it ,  don ' t eat it .

( the genuardis in flourtown and acme in ft washington both kinda suck )   however ,  if you ' re looking to do some heavy ,  stocking up ,  grocery shopping you ' re probably better off heading somewhere else .

    "text": "my brother took me here the dinner during my visit to nola .  the restaurant is adorable ,  beautiful decor with southern flair .  the hostess sat us at our table immediately and the server brought us water as we got settled .    the menu had a nice selection and can tell that they like to provide a southern twist to their dishes .  we ordered the french fries with truffle mayo -  which i was disappointed the fries looked pressed rather then freshly cut .   for an upscale restaurant i would think they can offer fresh cut potatoes .    i ordered the beef  \" pot roast \"  which turned out to be a perfectly cooked filet with the yummiest sauce that had mushrooms ,  carrots ,  and peas .  the steak was perfectly medium rare and sauce was nicely cooked .  my only criticism that the dish was heated so the good got cold real quick !   this is an upscale restaurant so the service was up there but little details of food preparation does not match up with the price of the dish .

    "text": "on this most - recent visit to square 1682 ,  we noticed the menu changed ,  removing my main draw to the restaurant :  the black bean burger .  the falafel sandwich that took its place was served on a rather hard bun ,  rather than traditional pita ,  which smushed the falafel as you ate and generally overwhelmed the flavors of the tzatziki sauce .   ( there are plenty of delicious falafel spots in the area that quite simply do it better .  )   the drop in rating comes from the  \" express lunch \"  taking 45 minutes to get to the table  ( we had 8 people ,  most of whom ordered the express lunch ,  assuming it would be quicker than the regular menu )  .  45 minutes is not express and not at all useful when lunching on a time limit .  it would ' ve been nice if the server had noted that because express lunches are served all 3 courses together ,  they do not come out as prepared  ( they ' re held under a heating lamp till all pieces are ready )  and therefore it might be faster for a large group to order off the regular menu .  we saw other groups  ( including some of our colleagues )  come and go in the time it took for us to get our food .   i still like the space ,  as it ' s quieter than many restaurants ,  so you can hear one another more easily ,  but this latest experience took a hit on my recommending it for future meals .  a tiny peeve :  the  \" giant cookie \"  was regular - sized  ( small ?  )  and fine ,  for oatmeal raisin .

    "text": "two star food and four star service .   went here for lunch today with the boss and a coworker .   tried the bbq nachos as the free check - in appetizer .   they were tasty  -  loaded with goodies and the bbq was good ,  kind of sweet which i like .   after telling my companions that anyone who orders a veggie burger at a bbq place should be taken out back and shot ,  i brilliantly ordered the soup and salad special .   caught some flack for that one ,  but the chili was made with burnt ends which i  ( theoretically )  love and i wasn ' t super - hungry after the nachos .   did not like the chili at all  -  the  \" burnt ends \"  were just cubes of brisket and the pieces were too big to manage in a chili .   the caesar salad was good but the lettuce was a little on the limp side .   boss had the ribs ;  glad i didn ' t order them because i could tell by watching him eat them that i would not have liked them .   i like tender ,  juicy meat that falls off the bone into my mouth and just melts .   these looked a little dry for my taste and he struggled to eat them with a knife and fork .   we agreed that the best part of the meal was the little piece of cinnamon bread pudding that came on the side of their lunch specials .     service was spot on ,  but we will probably stick to sugar fire or pappy ' s for bbq .

    "text": "if you ' re looking for a restaurant with ample options ,  hollywood grill has got you covered .  from all day breakfast options to sandwiches ,  burgers ,  pasta ,  seafood ,  meat entrees and dessert ,  there ' s something for everyone on the menu .  however ,  with a large selection quantity comes limited quality .  i ordered the buffalo chicken wrap and had to pull out almost all of my chicken because it looked and tasted suspicious .  my sister ordered the french dip and found the meat to be really dry .  one item i did like was the chili .  the bowl portion is served in a ceramic platter and is almost large enough to be a full meal .  the price range for sandwiches is around  $ 9 -  $ 13 while the entrees are closer to  $ 15 and seafood is over  $ 20 .  i can ' t imagine their seafood being fresh though so the price seems a bit high .  the restaurant opens at 6 am each day so i feel as if it ' s better as a casual breakfast spot than one i would go to for lunch or dinner .

    "text": "this review is based off of one visit as i don ' t think i will be returning anytime soon .    i was attending a christmas get together at besito with a large group of about 16 .  i ordered a  \" frozen \"  margarita .  it was the only frozen margarita on the menu and was pomegranate .  it was okay ,  but a little off for my tastes .  it was also melted and no longer frozen within a few minutes of it arriving .  i only finished about half of it .  we ordered during happy hour when the margarita is supposed to be  $ 5 instead of the usual  $ 9 .  we had to ask for the happy hour price ,  but more on that in a moment .    three of us decided to split a queso fundito .  this is one of my favorite mexican appetizers and i order it regularly at traditional mexican restaurants .  while the queso fundito was still good at besito ,  it was disappointing to someone that has had a traditional version .  it is supposed to be essentially a fondue type pot of melted cheese with some chorizo and served with tortillas .  besito cheapened theirs by adding piles of onions and peppers .  it was also served in a very shallow square skillet .  when split three ways  ( and with the 2 - 3 others in the room that tried it )  ,  it left very little queso fundito .  the flavor was good .  however ,  with the added thick peppers and onions and the small quantity ,  i would not order again .    i was able to try the chips ,  salsa and table side guacamole also .  i will say that this is probably the best guacamole that i have ever tried .  i loved the flavor and the thick chunks of avocado .  the salsa and guac were my favorite things at besito .  however ,  i can ' t see myself paying  $ 10 for guac on a return visit .  that is just way too much for guacamole in my opinion .    for my meal ,  i ordered the chile rellenos con hongos .  i order rellenos anytime i see them on the menu since they are one of my favorite things .  most restaurants serve them with some rice and beans or some sort of side .  let ' s face it .  .  . stuffed relleno peppers are not the most filling thing in the world .  my rellenos did not come with a side .  the came with sauce and nothing else for a whopping  $ 18 .  i almost didn ' t order them when i saw the price ,  but everything else on the menu was that price or higher .  the rellenos had good flavor for the first bite .  .  . or maybe two .  however ,  a few bites in i was over it .  they are stuffed in goat cheese and there are globs of goat cheese on the outside .  so much freaking goat cheese .  i like the stuff ,  but it was overboard .  that wasn ' t the worst part though ,  it was the pine nuts .  there seemed to be a whole bag of the things mixed into my small plate .  i would never order this again .    our service was great until it came time for the checks .  our waitress did not give us happy hour prices for the margaritas we ordered before happy hour was up .  she also messed up dividing our appetizer between the three checks .  however ,  the worst was that we handed the checks to them with our cards in each individual envelope .  when they returned ,  my card was with my friends check  ( and had been charged )  and my check was missing .  wth ?  it ended up taking us about 45 minutes to get our checks ,  get them corrected ,  get them corrected again and get out of there .  my poor husband had dropped me off and was waiting outside this whole time since i thought i was almost done when i received the check .  uggg .    i don ' t think i will be back to besito anytime soon .  if i do ,  it will be for happy hour only .  it is too rich and not on par enough for this cheap ,  but picky girl .

    "text": "we went to farmhaus last weekend for probably the 10th - 15th time .   as always ,  the food was amazing .   the mushroom salad was very tasty and the breakfast was as wonderful as always .   it is definitely one of my favorite meals there - or anywhere .     in the past ,  i would have given farmhaus five stars and moved on .     however ,  after we sat ,  we were informed of the chef ' s tasting menu - a new addition since the last time we had been there .   all was good and the menu looked great .   out of our party of four ,  we definitely had 1 - 2 people interested in this tasting menu ,  particularly because their morel mushroom pasts could only be ordered off this menu ,  not the regular menu .    the problem is that farmhaus insists that each person at the table order a tasting menu if one person does .   well ,  not everyone wanted a tasting menu !   we had a person with us recovering from the flu and he inquired whether he could split a tasting menu as he had little appetite and just wanted a bite of food .   nope ,  each person had to order their own .   so we had 2 people who wanted the tasting menu  ( at over 50 dollars )  and two who did not .   any flexibility ?   no .   we even thought about splitting the table up and having the two who wanted the tasting menu go sit by themselves so they could order what they wanted .   i ' m not sure that is something we should have had to consider .    we finally ordered entrees and moved on but were still very disappointed in the way this was handled and the inflexibility of the menu .   after this ,  plus a bill that seemed higher than usual  ( did they raise their prices recently ?  )  we have decided not to return .     i do want to say our server was amazing .   she was very nice and did apologize for the inflexibility of the menu nicely - but there was nothing she could do about it .     i am disappointed as this was one of our favorite restaurants ,  but again - i do not think we will be returning after this .

    "text": "three stars is pretty much on the money .  i don ' t understand a margaritaville in nashville but i also am probably not the actual target demographic of these places .  .  . see :  my dad who sometimes makes me think he can ' t find anything else on his xm radio other than margaritaville .    so we ' ve of course been to the one in the caymans and on key west .  since clearly these are out of the way places ,  i didn ' t get in the way of my parents having their experience here .    i was kind of hoping to avoid listening to music .  .  . or at least if i was going to have to listen to covers ,  not  \" call me maybe \"  gone country .  it ' s somewhat loud in here and i imagine as the night goes on it ' s louder .  we were here prior to a hockey game but it was still pretty busy .    since i procured my family a free app coupon i decided i was worthy of the 5 o ' clock somewhere which is a take on a hurricane ,  which somehow in five years of legal drinking i have never had before .  it wasn ' t bad .  i imagine it ' s one of those things where you ' re like  \" oh this barely tastes like alcohol ,  i ' ll have another \"  and then suddenly you ' re hitting on someone you shouldn ' t be hitting on .  wait what .   for that free app ,  we had the spinach artichoke dip .  it wasn ' t bad ,  i certainly wouldn ' t have let anyone pay full price for it though .    i wasn ' t feeling like having a full on sandwich or anything but there aren ' t really any smaller sized options .  i guess a cup of soup but i had had soup for lunch and it was like obscenely hot for december so that was out of the question .  i decided to just get the chicken quesadilla app and if i didn ' t finish it then whatever .  the rest of my family had burgers or a chicken sandwich .  the burgers were liked all around ,  although my brother got the diablo one and complained that it wasn ' t spicy enough .  but i don ' t think he understands that poblanos aren ' t that hot .   the quesadilla wasn ' t bad ,  there were some spots though where the chicken was a bit tough .  nothing you can ' t fix with a good bit of salsa though .    even though like i said it was pretty busy ,  we were there only about an hour .  service was great .  would i come back on my own ?  probably not .  in my case it ' s really one of those places where once is enough for the experience but if i were asked to come again ,  i wouldn ' t say no .

    "text": "there was a time when all i wanted to do was have an old fashioned at pub and kitchen ,  eat some meatloaf and take in my ipod playlist on the speakers .   it ' s changed considerably .   i don ' t know if the food quality dropped with the economy ,  but even their burgers are failing .   the only thing i recently had there with which i was impressed was sauteed swiss char with almonds and cranberries .    ( it was really well cooked with no bitter and all the flavor ,  just like char is supposed to taste )  .   their oysters are good if you ' re lucky enough to get there on a west coast day ,  but even then ,  they seem to get the small batches .    a real regret is that whatever bartender made me fall in love with the old fashioned has since wandered into a place of cheap watered down bourbon and cloying bitters .   a real shame for a bourbon cherry to go bad in a drink like that .    oh ,  and who took the doughnuts ?   really ?   of all the dessert items ,  you took the homemade doughnuts with chocolate dipping sauce ?   for shame !  i ' m hoping that as the winter rolls closer ,  we ' ll see the meatloaf again ,  with mushy peas ,  and mashed potatoes like a good simple urban hipster bar should class up .   for now ,  meh on all fronts except the neat interior and pretty awesome wait staff .

    "text": "in desire of gastropub fare ,  but tired of our usual haunts ,  a few friends and i ventured to pub and kitchen  ( 19th and lombard )  .  i had been to the former restaurant ,  chaucer ' s ,  once before ,  and the transformation was drastic .  pub and kitchen has been able to achieve lighting nirvana in their small space ,  creating a warmth that filters throughout .  service was quick and attentive without being overbearing .  but on to the food .   i highly recommend trying the bar snacks ,  which are a steal at  $ 3 a pop .  we sampled the duck liver pate and fish mop rolls .  the latter were delicious .  if memory and taste serve me correctly ,  it was some kind of white fish combined with a creme fraiche accompanied by potatoes and herbs on crusty bread ,  all of which is underscored by a hint of citrus .  the flavors are sophisticated and complex .  two large pieces come to an order .   entrees :  i was in the mood to go light ,  so i ordered the onion soup  (  $ 8 )  with a side of brussels sprouts  (  $ 5 )  .  what made the onion soup distinct was the addition of some kind of wheat beer  ( i think )  to the broth ,  which stood up to the strength of the cheese and paired well with the sweet ,  caramelized onions .  my only complaint :  some of the cheese on top of the soup burned at the edges under the broiler .  my side of brussels didn ' t achieve as high marks .  the brussels were overcooked as well as the accompanying bacon .  the flavors hit the mark ,  blending well ,  but the execution fell short .   we had also ordered the fish and chips ,  an altogether unspectacular dish ,  especially considering the steep price tag :   $ 16 - 18  ( don ' t remember exactly )  .  the chips lacked a certain crispness ,  adding to the overall ineptitude .  also ordered was the steak and potatoes  (  $ 22 )  .  not more perfectly could the steak be cooked !  rare ,  au poivre ,  and blissful .  not as much could be said of the potatoes ,  done in a hash brown / latke style ,  which seemed old and overdone .   in all ,  a pleasurable experience with exceptional flavor and ambiance ;  however ,  echoing other reviews ,  the actual cooking has yet to find its groove .  potatoes and brussels ,  especially at this price point ,  should be done without error .  this has yet to happen .   to sit at the bar with a drink and  \" bar snack \"  before venturing out for the evening -  - yes ,  this would be delightful and really the most prudent of actions .   ciao rwf",

    "text": "the long and the short of it :  a romantic little byob in newtown square that hits the mark in several areas .  big portions at decent prices .  you won ' t leave hungry !   and now for a full review :   i have been to this fellini ' s cafe and the one in bryn mawr several times and each time i ' ve visited there have been some memorable moments .  .  . and there have been speed bumps that keep this place from reaching its full potential .   on my latest visit this past friday night ,  i made reservations for 730 .  my beautiful wife and i arrived right at 730 .  although there were two vacant tables available ,  it took them at least 10 minutes or so to seat us .  and when they did ,  they broke up a table for 6 instead of putting us at the 2 seater .  odd .   being out and away from the kids for a few hours ,  we wanted at least a little bit of privacy ,  instead of sitting next to  ( pretty much connected to )  a table of four .  we asked the manager if we could be moved to the 2 seater .  .  . he said fine .  another 5 - 10 minutes  ( too long !  )  later a member of the wait staff came and ,  without any indication as to his intentions ,  whisked up our bottle of wine and silverware and ran off to the other table .  not a problem ,  but some eye contact and a simple  ' follow me please '  with even a hint of a smile would have been lovely .  we shrugged and just rolled with it .   the interior is quaint ,  and the lighting is dim .  it ' s a nice place for a romantic meal .  but it is loud .  so loud i would say this place is kid friendly despite being in such close quarters with your neighbors .  not sure if we ' d ever try taking our four kids there  ( actually i ' m certain we won ' t )  but one or two can be done without much trouble .   our waitress was extremely polite and offered the energy and enthusiasm that our other friend lacked .   for dinner ,  we ordered a caesar salad to share and for our main courses my wife opted for her usual tagliatelli with mushroom cream sauce and i had what i always have ,  the tortellini pasticiatti .   complimentary with the meal were two pieces of bruschetta  ( very nice )  and a small loaf of crusty italian bread ,  which is served with butter packets  ( which perhaps only i find strange for an italian restaurant ?  )  .    overall the food was delicious ,  except for a few somewhat minor hiccups :    1 .  the caesar salad was served on a warm plate .  the salad was excellent and would have been legendary had it been served on a chilled  ( or at least not warm !  )  plate .   2 .  i am pretty sure they used frozen peas in the tortellini dish ,  which is fine with me as long as you make sure the peas are thawed before you serve it !  only a few peas were not quite thawed ,  but it marred what was otherwise a perfectly crafted masterpiece of a dish .   when we paid ,  the manager allowed us to use an expired gift card .  that was a very nice gesture and one that required no push from us to induce .   all in all ,  i ' ll keep visiting fellini because it ' s relatively inexpensive and they do most everything well .

    "text": "i hit the drive - thru at this white castle last night with my aunt on our way home from carmel .  i was starving and it hit the spot .    our order was taken right away and in a friendly manner .  the food seemed to take several minutes ,  but was hot and fresh and worth the wait .  it was my first time trying the new veggie sliders .  they aren ' t the best veggie burgers i have ever had ,  and are quite high in calories from what i hear ,  but were good .  i appreciate that white castle started offering these for the cravers that no longer do meat .   the only small disappointment was that when we were asked if we wanted sauce ,  what kind of sauce i do not know ,  i requested mustard on my sliders and that was left off .  there also were no napkins or salt in the bag .  it was hard to tell my veggie slider from my aunt ' s fish sandwich digging in the bag in the car .  the large portions on our medium fries made up for it though as well as being a quick and convenient place for someone like me to grab a meal on the run that contained some much needed protein .   service was friendly and the restaurant seemed clean .  it appears to be either a newer store or a very well - kept one .  bonus was seeing one of the indy chicken limos down the road .   updating to say ,  while good tasting ,  the food i had did not sit quite right with me .   it was possibly that i ' m not used to greasy combined with being out of sorts lately .  tastes good ,  but i may need antacid or something next time .

(  i am a nice person  ,  but often a waitress '  worst nightmare  )   on to the food  -  spring roll  (  substitution )  was nicely done with a sweet sauce with crushed peanuts and shredded carrot .   lunch special soup was tom yum and was incredibly salty .  i couldn ' t eat more than two bites .  and personal preference for me ,  i like my mushrooms cooked -  the ones in the soup were sliced and dropped in the hot broth so they were more raw than cooked .   this had nothing to do with the soup ,  just be aware for personal preference .   red curry came  ,  medium spicy and was spot on for spiciness .   but the curry itself had no flavor .   there was a nice assortment of vegetables ,  and the chicken had that weird texture  -  like it was boiled rather than saut\u00e9ed  .   took a bit of curry sauce alone without rice and it was simply bland  .    and for all the times i complained about  \"  too strong \"  thai ice tea  ,  this was again ,  bland  .   i felt i wasted all those calories on a drink with no flavor  !   on a positive note ,  i had the brown rice instead of white rice and this is the first thai restaurant that doesnt charge more for brown rice !     the food was disappointing overall , but the service was so good .   overall rating was 3 stars  ,  1 for food and 2 for service   (  and for the brown rice upgrade at no charge )   !

    "text": "i waited a long time to finally try this place and i have to say i was let down a bit .  i tried the mandatory dan dan noodles .  they were very flavorful and not too spicy .  nothing mind blowing here just a really good lo mein or spicy pasta dish with virtually no protein more or less .  also had the scallion pancakes .  i was just in chinatown recently at a place i also reviewed  ( first person from yelp to do so )  and they were way better there .   (  i highly recommend you try that place )  these were more like quesadillas laying flat where as the other ones jumped off the plate and were so much more crispy and substantial .  the last appetizer i had was the wontons in chilli oil .  these were just not good to me at all and one bite was all i needed .  basically it is steamed wontons in a bowl with the soup being the chilli oil .  just heavy heavy choking heat with very little substance or taste .  take those same homemade wontons and pan fry them with some chilli peppers and a nice light sauce and you have could a real winner but i digress .  finally we tried the talapia medallions  .  these were fried to perfection but there were some greens mixed in that i could not chew through and had to discard via the old napkin trick which to me is a bit of a deal / star breaker .   the service was very good and the atmosphere very nice but i wouldn ' t go out of my way to eat here again .  all i could think about was how much more i prefer cantonese style where its all about flavors and you can add heat as you like it .  i ' m sure i could find better authentic szechuan cuisine that better suits my taste just not here .  it feels very commercialized and americanized .  i prefer the hole in the wall places where i am the only caucasian in the place a heck of a lot more .

( it was on the bill later )  we had finished it ,  and it was tasty ,  so we didn ' t complain .  the queso and tortillas were quite good ,  though the serving could have been a bit larger .    between the four of us ,  we ordered most of the meats on the menu in various forms :  tacos ,  gorditas ,  tostadas ,  and a carne asana plate .  when the food came ,  there were more things we didn ' t order ,  and we sent back .  of my 4 tacos ,  two were not what i ordered ,  but i was starving ,  so i ate them anyway .  son ' s carne asana was flavorful ,  but overlooked .  peach margarita was large and tasty ,  but had very little tequila !   my favorite was the tinga de pollo -  the chicken was juicy and flavorful with just a bit of spice .   ( that taco alone made the visit worthwhile !  )   got the bill ,  and we had been charged for the items we had not ordered ,  and sent back ,  and she had not taken off the discount for the yelp check in ,  so we had to have that corrected .    we left full ,  and generally satisfied with the food .

    "text": "i had very mixed feelings about baileys '  range .   i felt like this restaurant did many things right ,  and a couple of things wrong .    i ' ll start out with the good .   the atmosphere and service were fantastic .   the person who took my order was friendly and helpful .   the restaurant is spacious and clean .   she suggested the rooster sauce for my fries and i had no complaints about the fries or sauce .   unfortunately ,  my burger experience was not so great .   keep in mind the fact that i was hung over and hadn ' t eaten since the previous night ,  so a big mac would have been delicious to me .   i ordered the  $ 12 ground lamb burger and was highly anticipating it ' s lamby goodness .   when the burger arrived ,  it came with a homemade pickle  ( good )  and homemade ketchup  ( fantastic )  .   now ,  when i order a burger at an upscale  ( ish )  burger restaurant ,  i don ' t expect the burger to be large .    however ,  i do expect an appropriate bun size that doesn ' t totally overpower the rest of the sandwich .   in this case ,  the homemade bun was dry and far too thick for the not - so - well - endowed burger patty .   i ended up taking the top half of the bun and eating the burger like that and it was better .   all that said ,  the sides ,  shakes and atmosphere were enough to make me lean positive in spite of the burger ,  but barely .   i would be debating 4 or 5 stars if the burger was fantastic .   unfortunately it wasn ' t ,  and considering burgers are the main draw here ,  the best rating i can give is an unenthusiastic 3 stars .

    "text": "if you ' re adventurous in your food - tasting ,  i guess this would be the place to go .  i came here during mardi gras weekend ,  and found it  ( after searching for 30 minutes )  in one of the alleyways with very few people dining in .  it seemed strange to me ,  as people on the streets were raging outside ,  why this restaurant was as deserted as it was .  i soon found out the reason .   the food was definitely not my cup of tea .  we were feeling adventurous and ordered the p\u00e2t\u00e9 of louisiana rabbit  &  chicken livers and pied de cochon  \" croustillant \"  off the charcuterie section .  not what we were expecting .  apart from the fact that we did not speak french and had no idea what we were ordering ,  the waiter made no attempt to help us despite our questioning gazes .  when they arrived ,  the croustillant turned out to be two small pieces of deep - fried undistinguishable meat  ( or pig ' s feet meat ,  not that we could tell )  .  we couldn ' t see where the louisiana rabbit  &  chicken livers were ,  but on the other plate was a jar full of questionable jam .  we soon found out the  \" jam \"  was actually the  \" p\u00e2t\u00e9 \"  of the livers .  ech .   the service was pretty absent  ( or should i say absentminded ?  )  .  when we first entered the restaurant ,  the host was talking on the phone with her friend / so ,  and even though we stood right in front of her ,  she kept on giggling to the person on the other end of the phone .  it wasn ' t until a man with a managerial vibe stood behind her that she hung up the phone and showed us to our seats .  our waiter clearly was not really paying attention .  he told us he would bring us water with lemons and straws ,  and it took him 30 minutes to bring just the water ,  without the lemons and straws  ( but i guess i must be too picky )  .  when it was time to ring up the check ,  he brought us a check totaling  $ 100 .  um excuse me ?  no way two deep - fried balls and a jar of pate could cost  $ 100 .  we had to wait for him to come around to ask him if it was the right check .  so in total :   time we spent waiting for service = 1 - 2 hours time we spent eating = 10 minutes get the picture ?   the atmosphere was pretty good .  dim lighting gave off a romantic kind of feel .  the bookshelves were a nice touch .  made me want to grab a book and start reading it while waiting for service .

    "text": "funky bar / restaurant in fountain square .   interesting decor based on mexican wrestling theme .  mixed crowd of young folks ,  townies ,  and regulars .   not quite sure if primary function is to be a bar or restaurant .  the menu is limited with appetizers ,  tacos ,  and burgers .  we ordered chicken and pork tacos .  the pork was excellent .  .  . sweet but with a kick .   the chicken was kind of dry but there was a variety of sauces to jazz them up .   what was impressive was the whiskeys and draft craft brews offered ,  i had a green flas west coast ipa draft .  .  .  . in indiana .  well done !   a fun place for a casual dinner but would like to see some more food variety .  almost forgot to mention there ' s a tiki bar in the back  ( will check it out on the return trip )  .

    "text": "we started off with the mussels  ( belgian )  ,   it was good ,  but the mussels were very small .  the filet mignon was cooked the way i liked it  ( mr )  ,  but it was not seasoned well ,  if at all and the outer side tasted burnt .  the lump crab was minimal ,  and the mashed potatoes were not anything out of the ordinary ,  but the asparagus was cooked properly .  the hollandaise sauce was gelatinous and looked to be left out for a while ;  i did not care for that .  everything is a la carte  ( which basically means eat less or pay more )  .  we ordered mushroom risotto and the brussel sprouts with the dinner .  it is very hard to find good risotto ,  but at marmont ,  the risotto was well cooked and tasty .  the brussel sprouts were good ,  but it would have been nice to have it seasoned ,  but i suppose that is what the bacon and shallots are for .  if the prices were lowered or if the entrees included one side ,  i would try this place again .

    "text": "meh .  the best way to describe this place .  not amazing ,  not terrible .  just meh .   the food is your typical greasy and cholesterol / heart - attack inducing chinese food available around the corner of the block .  that isn ' t to say it is bad  -  it ' s just the americanized  ( and nothing compared to the real stuff )  chinese food .   the vegetarian options are plenty ,  although vegetarians should be wary of anything fried  -  the fryers are the same whether they are frying chicken ,  pork ,  beef ,  or your vegetables .   the upside is that the food is quite cheap ,  and for a location close to several college campuses ,  i ' m sure they ' re doing quite well .    just watch your back when you ' re in the area ;  streets in the high 30 ' s through low 40 ' s in the lancaster / powelton area can get a bit seedy in the evenings and night .

    "text": "i came in here the other night for a  post - show snack after seeing a eso performance at the winspear .  the main reason we chose this location was because it was close to the winspear ,  and open late  ( until 11 : 30pm on friday and saturday )  .  i don ' t have any strong criticisms of the restaurant .  i suppose ,  if anything ,  the menu may have seemed a little bit over - priced  -  at least for what i ordered .  i had a caesar salad with three  ' jumbo '  shrimp on it ,  which cost  $ 15 .  the portion size did not seem to justify the cost and the jumbo shrimp were fairly average in their size ,  but the flavours were good and the ingredients were fresh .  my friend had a soup ,  which looked and smelled absolutely amazing ,  and at  $ 6 it didn ' t seem too unreasonable .  she also had the smoked salmon carpaccio ,  which looked very appetizing with its thick slices of dark rye bread and generous slices of smoked salmon and capers .  the also had a couple of interesting beers on their menu that we were keen to try .   i think if you ' re going to a show in the area and looking for a spot to get a drink or a snack afterward ,  this is not a bad option .  their menu at that time of night had an interesting mix of appetizers and desserts that seemed to provide something to suit most tastes .   i ' m assuming normand ' s bistro must be connected to the normand ' s restaurant which is on jasper avenue .  of interest ,  i have heard that normand ' s took over the brunch menu that had formerly been offered at the glenora bistro .

    "text": "i used to stop into this bellacino ' s location once in a while when i lived in this neighborhood .  i was around here last thursday in the early afternoon and hadn ' t eaten lunch so i decided stop in .  i ordered a 12pc toasted ravioli and a soda to go .  my bill was  $ 13 and some change .  i thought this was a little excessive for an order of frozen toasted ravioli .  it wasn ' t bad .  it was just status quo .  some of the ravioli were over fryed and the filling had oozed out and some were fine .  all in all decent lunch on the go but for over  $ 13 i could have sat down at almost any restaurant in town and had a leisurely delicious lunch and been waited on !

    "text": "my lunch included a small portion of jerk chicken ,  collard greens ,  and apparently cabbage .   i wanted mac and cheese !   cabbage sounds nothing like mac - n - cheese !   anyway ,  after my initial shock and disappointment when i opened the container ,  i started digging into the chicken .   portions are very big ,  and the chicken fell off the bone and was juicy .   i love jamaican food and get the cuisine in any city i visit ,  so i was a bit disappointed by their chicken .   it wasn ' t bad ,  just not very flavorful or memorable .   collard greens and cabbage  ( ugh )  were the same story .   for  $ 8 plus tip ,  i was expecting something much more ,  especially after all the great reviews .  i did notice the customers ahead of me ordered chicken wings ,  so maybe i ' ll try that the next time .     i can ' t imagine a worst place to be then in a food truck during a heat wave ,  so i will say that the service was very friendly by the lady .

    "text": "marathon was ok ,  but nothing spectacular .   they have a nice  $ 20 for a 3 - course dinner deal ,  which made it extremely affordable .   however ,  i opted for chicken noodle soup and the buffalo chicken sandwich .   the veggies in the soup were cooked perfectly ,  as were the noodles and chicken .   however ,  the soup had no flavor and there was too little noodles ,  veggies and chicken to the amount of broth .   the chicken sandwich was delicious though .   i also had the spiked apple cider ,  warm ,  but it wasn ' t that great .   service was ok ,  but i wanted to order my soup first so that the sandwich wouldn ' t come out too quickly .   my waiter assured me to put in my whole order and they would time it appropriately ,  but as i suspected i was only two spoonfuls into my soup when my sandwich came .   overall ,  ok ,  but nothing more .

    "text": "timpano ' s has been on my list of places to visit for quite some time now ,  based on recommendations from other yelpers as well as a friend of mine who works there as a bartender .  mind you ,  this place is a bit fancier than where i would normally go ,  but last night was a special occasion  ( anniversary dinner for the man and i )  so we made reservations for 2 and decided to venture out for a swanky evening .   when we arrived ,  the host was friendly ,  efficient and brought us to our table right away .  the server promptly greeted us after ,  but we needed a few moments to browse the wine list so we asked him to return shortly .  when he came back ,  we ordered a glass of commodore wine and a malbec red wine as well as the tuna poke appetizer .  as we settled in ,  i noticed the environment in the restaurant had a great feel to it .  the live jazz band that was playing added a nice touch ,  that was one of the reasons we chose this place to begin with .   the app and wine were delivered to us quickly .  we both enjoyed our wine and the appetizer was tasty as well .  i ' m not one to eat raw tuna often ,  but it was well seasoned and had a good consistency ,  so that was a winner .  next we split the watercress  &  arugula salad ,  which was brought out to us on 2 small plates  ( bonus points when a restaurant does that without me having to ask them to split it )  .  that was really tasty as well ,  had a great mix of flavors .   for our entrees ,  he chose the chicken marsala and i ordered the sea scallops with polenta and asparagus .  the server gave him a choice of spaghetti or a vegetable side with the marsala and he went for the spaghetti .  when our meals came out ,  i was a bit surprised to see that my meal only came with 3 small scallops on a scoop of polenta and some overcooked asparagus .  i ' m not normally one to eat all of my meal when i go out ,  i almost always have leftovers ,  but this was such a small portion i ate it all up even with the apps and salad that we had first .  mind you ,  the scallops were very tasty ,  but for  $ 25 i would expect a bigger portion .  sadly ,  he said his chicken marsala was a poor quality ;  it had no taste ,  the spaghetti was a big gloppy hunk of noodles and to top it off they even charged extra for the spaghetti .  who charges extra for noodles at an italian restaurant when they are traditionally included with the dish anyway ?   as a final touch ,  the server knew we were celebrating a special occasion ,  so they brought us out a slice of tiramisu to share ,  which was indeed delicious .  some of the best tiramisu i ' ve ever had .  this helped to redeem the poor chicken marsala experience a bit .    overall ,  the service was good ,  the food was tasty for the most part and the ambience was upscale yet relaxing ,  so those were all good points .  based on the few negative points with the small portion size of my meal and the poor quality of his ,  we have arrived a total score of 3 stars for timpano ' s .  i ' ve heard great things about their weekend brunch and mimosas ,  so may consider returning for that sometime .

    "text": "oh ,  how i miss the city !  being able to walk from our hotel to prohibition was pretty awesome ,  even if there were a few sketchy corners along the way .  once inside ,  we took in the serpentine bar and packed tables with some difficulty  ( it was quite dark )  and luckily found seats right away ;  by the time we left ,  over an hour later ,  people were standing three deep all around the bar .    we started out sitting at one of the bar islands ,  directly across from three strangers ;  this might appeal to some extreme extroverts ,  but it was a little awkward for us .  they paid us no attention and had a very loud conversation  ( trendy vocal - fry girls  -  -  ugh )  so we tried to return the favor ,  but they were hard to ignore ,  so when true bar seats opened up we scooted over and left them to their workplace gripes .   the drink menu is pretty wonderful ;  awesome draft  /  bottle selection ,  in addition to a handful of craft cocktails .  we stuck to beer and were not disappointed ;  the bartender ,  once he saw what we liked ,  offered us a couple of samples and was able to continue making us happy through several more rounds .    we weren ' t dinner - hungry ,  but wanted to try the battered green beans since so many had raved about them .  they were pretty disappointing ;  the beans were overcooked and stringy ,  and the batter stuck together in huge lumps  -  -  it was more like a battered green bean sculpture .  we ate about half and left the rest .  next we tried the fried pretzel ,  which was good ,  though not exactly pretzel - like ,  since it had been deep - fried instead of soda - boiled .  the accompanying queso was delicious ,  but there was only one small ramekin ,  so we ate most of the pretzel plain .   it turned out there had been quite a party a few hours earlier ,  as the first friday of every month is a pig roast .  it sounded intriguing ,  but our server didn ' t know any of the details  -  -  where ,  how and for what amount of time it was cooked ,  for instance  -  -  so we didn ' t try it .   we would definitely return for the beer ,  and to try one of their standbys like the burger or the brick chicken .

    "text": "my wife and i went last night for the first time because we are considering moving to seminole heights .   before i write a full review i will say the food was great ,  but the service sub - par .     the first thing we noticed as we walked in was a sign in sheet and there were only 4 names in front of us ,  we figured it shouldn ' t take very long ,  plus there are 2 tables open that just need to be cleared .   about a half hour passed and we were still waiting and only one of the two tables had been cleared .   finally after an hour of waiting we were seated .   soon after being seated we were able to order and the service got better .   as we were waiting ,  we were never greeted or offered any kind of beverage which certainly would have raised my rating .   a suggestion would be to have somebody host and at least give you some idea of how long you are going to be waiting .   the noise level is very high because its such a large room and terrible acoustics ,  so you have to talk at a high level .   the decor in the place is awesome with old vespa like scooters hanging from the ceiling ,  old bikes ,  toys ,  coke signs ,  etc .   the tables have toys and games on display under glass which is really cool .     now for the food .   great !  i loved the pizza .   we also had breadsticks ,  great ,  and a greek salad that we loved .   a small salad was big enough for two of us .   we got the the cappy that was new york style and would certainly recommend .   we will definitely be going back to try the chicago style ,  but probably not on a friday night .    it ' s possible that it was an off night ,  maybe someone called in sick ?   it looked like there were only 2 waitresses for the whole place and it was a friday night .   overall ,  mediocre experience ,  great food ,  and we will be going back to give another shot .

    "text": "i absolutely love acai bowls so i had to stop in when visiting from seattle .   on a sunday around 11 ,  all the seats were taken and there was a small line .  i only had to wait 5 to 10 minutes to receive my bowl ,  which i think is reasonable .    i ordered the backyard bowl  ( which only comes in the large size for some reason .  .  .  why ?  )  .  this acai bowl includes a base made of acai ,  banana ,  strawberries ,  and hemp milk .  the bowl is topped with sliced banana ,  chopped strawberries ,  blueberries ,  goji berries ,  bee pollen and granola ,  plus a honey drizzle if you want .  it ' s already sweet enough so the honey isn ' t necessary .  i added peanut butter to mine for a protein kick and more flavor .  i enjoyed the bowl itself ,  although it takes some work to get down to the actual acai base in the to - go cup .  i would have liked a few more berries too .  the granola itself is kind of meh .  .  .  not bad but not great .  for the price  (  $ 13 to  $ 14 after tax and tip )  i think the bowl should have been a little better .  again ,  don ' t get me wrong ,  it was good overall .  if you ' re hungry and can put away a decent amount of food ,  you should be able to finish the large .  next time i would omit the goji berries because i ' m not a huge fan of the flavor but wanted to give them another shot .   everyone working there was pleasant ,  but service wasn ' t spectacular .  i don ' t care too much about that as long as i don ' t have to wait forever for my food to be ready .  the place itself could have been a little cleaner .  .  .  it wasn ' t super messy but there were strawberry butts scattered on the floor near the chopping station and the fruity smell in the air seemed a little stale .   ( that ' s just me being super picky and an ocd clean - freak .  .  .  it ' s probably totally acceptable based on normal people standards )  .   overall ,  i wouldn ' t be opposed to coming here again in the future .  i might try the pb & j quinoa bowl because that sounds amazing !  nothing beats the acai bowls in kirkland ,  wa though .

    "text": "it ' s a classic new orleans restaurant ,  known for bbq shrimp and classic shrimp  &  grits  ( among other things )  .   ambiance is nice ,  service is extremely professional and quite good at understanding each table ' s needs ,  so my overall experience has been pretty good on a couple visits .   cocktails and wine list are good ,  and they even dealt well with a nice bottle of wine i brought to complement those we bought for a larger work dinner .   everything was quite nice on my most recent visit from food to service to overall atmosphere .   the issue i had is that myself and two other co - workers who ate the shrimp  &  grits all came down with clear food poisoning symptoms after eating here .   this was the only meal and common food item shared between the three of us ,  and it ' s clear that mr .  b ' s was the issue .   understandably ,  this was the night after the hurricane that closed down the city on a saturday night so i have to think this contributed to some food ordering and storage issues for a number of restaurants in town .   however ,  it ' s much less understanding when it ' s you who is sick for days afterward ,  or in this case my boss who had to finish up a conference and fly home on the evening after his symptoms hit .   not fun at all .   in theory ,  mr .  b ' s is a good choice for classic new orleans food .   in reality ,  i don ' t think i will be able to go back for a long time .   the bad experience was probably due to extenuating circumstances from the hurricane but regardless it seems that a professional kitchen needs to be able to do better .

( not ideal when this is a stop for lunch and you have plans to sightsee afterwards )   perhaps for brunch / breakfast their food is better but i ' m not impressed .  we ' ve been able to find much better food elsewhere and likely won ' t return to this place .
