    "text": "i first visited the barnes jewish cafeteria while waiting for a family member whom was having surgery .  i stopped in just before the lunch rush to discover a wide variety of lunch options ,  ranging from several selections of hot dishes ,  sandwiches ,  salads ,  and more .  i ended up going with a chicken parmesan entree ,  which was priced at about  $ 8 for a reasonable portion .  seating is plentiful ,  however it does get crowded during lunch so be advised ,  after the lunch rush you might find others using the cafeteria to work while waiting on people at the hospital ,  in fact i even used it to catch up on some work while waiting .    overall the experience was better than i had expected from a hospital cafeteria ,  decent food ,  reasonable options ,  and a fair price makes this a decent option while visiting the hospital .

    "text": "i stopped by before a parade and met with my family who were visiting from out of town .  joanna was a great server and we loved the oysters !  the place was busy and we waited about 10 minutes for our table .  the hostess jaclynne was very polite and made some great menu suggestions .  however ,  we almost left the restaurant after witnessing one of the other staff members who i can only assume was a manager or supervisor ,  a black woman with very short hair ,  verbally accost our hostess in front of guests .  it set a terrible tone for the experience and made me not want to stay and eat there .  however ,  jaclynn continued to be kind to us despite being humiliated by the manager in front of our party as well as several guests and  we ended up staying .  i felt terrible for the host and how the manager spoke to her in such an abusive and unprofessional manor .  i stopped in the next night and enjoyed more oysters and fantastic service by the bartender michelle and observed no abusive management .

    "text": "just had a classic wawa chicken salad hoagie .  i topped it with spinach ,  american cheese ,  sweet peppers ,  pickles and both spicy and honey mustard .  pepper was also added .    what i unwrapped was essentially chicken flavored mayonnaise .  the toppings and mayo - mustard sauce were delectable on the soft roll ,  but i was really hoping that i had gotten more chicken .  there are three reasons that could be contributing to my dismay .  they could occur either in isolation ,  or some combination of the three :   reason one :   the bottom of the chicken salad container .  this area of chicken salad contains mostly mayonnaise and smaller chicken particles .    reason two :   lunch hour .  i was order  # 198 .  the sandwich being called at the counter was in the  # 178 range .  at this time ,  i feel that the fine luncheoneers at this particular wawa could have felt the pressure of the lunchtime rush .    reason three :   hoagiefest .  i ' m sure that everyone is familiar with our favorite three month sandwich discount .  more recently ,  the rolls moved from 12 to 10 inches .  could it possibly be that this is solely a marketing campaign and not a celebration of the world ' s fourth greatest sandwich ?   wild card :  location .  there is not another wawa in this area for ,  what in my estimation would ,  be a 3 mile radius ,  partially a manifestation of the lunch hour component .    two stars for wawa is a bit harsh ,  so due to past experiences with the wawa chain ,  they earn three stars .

    "text": "i ' ve been to mount laurel ' s on the border over 50 times .  i used to go to don pablo ' s but i fell in love with on the border ' s chips and salsa  ( their chips are nice and salty ,  and their salsa is a little spicier )  .   when i go ,  90 %  of the time i just sit at the bar and drink beer and snack on their chips and salsa .  the beer specials are pretty good but could be a little better -  weekdays has a happy hour as well as a late night happy hour too .   when i do dine ,  i often just enjoy a variety of vegetarian sides .  lately ,  i ' ve grown to enjoy their cheese enchiladas ,  which i find delicious .  service when dining is usually great .   as for the bartenders ,  it ' s really hit - or - miss .  joann is probably my favorite -  she ' s friendly ,  attentive ,  funny ,  and i ' ve really gotten to know her ,  and i ' d give them 5 stars if my experience was with her alone .  there is a bartender named nikki though ,  and if she ' s there ,  i always get the worst service .  she barely checks on me / us to see how we ' re doing ,  she seems unfriendly ,  if she actually comes to refill your chips then she will not refill your salsa ,  she has taken my beer and refilled it without asking  ( when i was done and trying to leave )  ,  and i ' ve had to wait forever to ask her for my check .  at least twice ,  i ' ve had to ask other bartenders to bring my check so that i could finally close out and leave .  i ' d give them 1 star if my experience was based on her alone .   overall ,  good appetizers ,  cold beer ,  moderate prices ,  and usually good service .

    "text": "i have had a few pretty good experiences here and one really negative one that prompted our party to leave before eating .    generally speaking ,  the food is good .  it ' s the best italian in town ,  in my opinion ,  but my mother would fight me on that one .  they start you off with some complimentary bruschetta ,  which is nice .  i recommend the mixed baby greens salad to start ,  which is more like a greek salad and is a generous portion for  $ 5 .  i would also recommend the porcini stuffed agnolotti .  i have tried a few of their desserts  -  i liked the chocolate souffle but thought the coppa pistachio left something to be desired .  the free limoncello shot at the end of the meal is a nice touch .   the problem here is the service .  it seems that there is always a wait ,  even if you have a reservation .  i don ' t usually mind waiting but they have very little standing room and no vestibule ,  so you end up standing by the door and get blasted with cold air every time someone opens it .  i went recently with my family for their lunch buffet ,  which looked quite nice .  we ended up waiting about 25 minutes ,  during which the hostess sat several smaller parties  ( which is fine )  ,  then started to seat a slightly larger party that had come in long after us .  when we interjected to find out what was going on and why we had been passed over ,  the hostess said something along the lines of  \" oh i don ' t know ,  you all walked in at once .  \"  we had been there much longer ,  but apparently she hadn ' t been keeping a list  ( she told us so )  even though she had been taking names .  isn ' t that what hostesses do ?  only upon us asking why this was happening and expressing our unhappiness with the service did she run off to check with a manger then report back that she needed to seat the larger party ,  without explanation .  by this time the buffet was close to its end time and it seemed silly to pay only to receive the last bits and pieces ,  so we decided to leave and go down the street to kooma where we were seated immediately and had a delicious brunch !   this restaurant is fine and a good choice if you are craving italian food ,  but i generally prefer other places in west chester .  also ,  be prepared for a wait and a potentially rude hostess !   but by the way ,  richard works here now  -  he used to work at gilmore ' s and is the best waiter in town !

    "text": "this review pertains only to saigon market ,  i will save the restaurant for another review .   this is probably my least favorite asian market in town and probably asian for that matter .   but they have two benefits that earn a visit from me every now and then .     even though they have a very limited fresh meat selection but it is definitely the best out of all the asian market .   you won ' t find rib eyes or filet mignon here ,  but more rustic cut such as pork belly ,  pork shoulder ,  beef shank ,  beef loin ,  and innards .   the second benefit is the one male worker ,  i think he ' s the butcher ,  stocking boy ,  and cleaner .   he ' s pretty fast when it comes to helping you with the meat .   if i needed him to cut the meat and bones a certain way ,  he ' ll be on it .   his english isn ' t very good but i think he can make out keyword and can help you find what you are looking for .    their vegetable selection is limited and caters to asian cooking .   out of all the asian market on lafayette road ,  saigon has the worst vegetables !    they always look like they are dead or near dead .    the herbs in the refrigerated section is not too bad though and usually pretty fresh .   if you are wanting to buy vegetables though ,  i say skip saigon and go to saraga or oriental market .    saigon has a similar selection of dried goods and frozen items like van ' s fish market .    check expiration dates especially on canned goods and i would be careful of frozen items as well .   i always make sure i do a thorough examination .     saigon also sells freshly made bake goods and exotic fruits ,  and you can find them scatter up by the register .   the owner usually stands behind the register ,  she usually doesn ' t say anything to any of the shopper unless she knows them .   i wish she would be more cheery because it kinda ruins my shopping mood because i enjoy grocery shopping .   overall ,  saigon would be a meh experience but the fresh meat selection earns this place another star .

    "text": "here is our back story .   do you have a little time to kill ?   good because it ' s gonna be fascinating .   i ' m gonna wow you with amazing tales of chili dogs and burgers .   no wait .  .  . don ' t go !   it ' ll be great !   ok well for those of you who stayed .  .  . here ' s my back story .   we were in the gsr for a pentatonix concert .   we had gotten there early to camp out a spot to get a better seat because the general admission at the gsr is really bad .   so this meant that during our dinner hour we were going to be stuck in line .   luckily a very nice couple held our spot while we stopped into johnny rockets .   we asked to sit at the bar to make it quicker .   we ordered up two chili dogs for my daughter ,  a classic burger for my wife and i ordered up the houston .  i upgraded to sweet potato fries for a buck extra .   the burgers coming out looked really good ,  mine wasn ' t as good looking and was just fine tasting .   nothing to write home about or get excited about ,  just a standard fare sort of burger .   my daughter however loved the chili dogs and ate them all up and her fries .   she enjoyed the paper hat that came with the kids meal menu .    our waitress daniel was really busy but also really helpful and friendly .   so if you are staying at the hotel for either a convention or just gambling ,  this place is a good place to eat for a reasonable price .   the prices are right in line with any other sit down burger joint ,  maybe even a little lower .   parking isn ' t really that close because it ' s inside the mall downstairs at the gsr ,  but it is 1000000 times better than it ' s old location on the casino floor getting covered in smoke all day long .     wondering how busy they will be when summer comes and  \" the beach \"  is open .   we will see .

    "text": "first i must say the food was excellent .   the gorganzola filet with wine sauce was truly outstanding .   my primary complaint was with the service .   i was staying the week at the hotel next door and had dinner at carmine ' s 3 times .   i finally came to the conclusion that management has trained the waiters to rush the service in order to turn the tables as frequently as possible .    each night i dined with work  associates and throughout the meals the waiters kept trying to take away plates too soon .   it became difficult to have a relaxing dinner and constantly felt rushed .    on the 3rd night we spoke to the owner and it was clear that he did not want to take our complaint seriously and issued a very insincere apology .    in the end ,  he paid for our meals  .   all of us at the table would have preferred that he would have acted more humble and treat us with more respect .   we were not looking for a free meal .   it was a company expense anyway .   we can only hope that he might think about what we told him .    we were most sincere and not trying to be difficult .   in his mind we were wrong and he was right .     all of the waiters i saw looked and acted somewhat inexperienced .   i suspect that mature professional waiters would not get along with the owner very well .    he seemed like a hot head and is probably difficult to work for .

    "text": "it was a pretty cute little restaurant ;  the atmosphere was definitely  \" neighborhood pub .  \"   we had a very nice  ( very obviously not ethiopian )  waitress with multiple visible piercings .   she was  (  * gasp *   )  very attentive for an ethiopian restaurant waitress .   the service was not as good quick as the average non - ethiopian restaurant ,  but it definitely blew all the ethiopian restaurant services away with the speed !   gee ,  i wonder if it could be because she ' s not ethiopian ?  !  ?  !  ?  !   hahaha  however ,  she did mention that she grew up in west philly eating ethiopian food .   mmmm i ' m jealous !     as is my custom ,  i went to use the bathroom and wash my hands before the meal .   considering that ethiopian food is eaten with one ' s hands ,  i would highly recommend this practice to all my friends  .   there were two  \" stalls \"  in the bathroom .   both stalls have saloon styled doors  ( 2 halves swinging freely in the middled ,  hinged on either side )  .   the first one was lit ,  but the right half of the door was missing .   given this ,  i opted for the second stall .   after stepping inside ,  i noticed a good 2 inches between the halves of the door .   needless to say ,  i did my business in a hurry all the while praying that no one else would come in .   please ladies ,  go to the bathroom before eating at this restaurant .   it is a harrowing experience !   when the food came  ( sooner than expected )  ,  the portions were fairly generous .   when i bit into the injera at the queen of sheba ,  i was pleasantly surprised .   it was fairly sour !   it was not as sour as abyssinia ' s injera ,  but definitely a few steps more sour than anywhere else i have tried up to date .   now ,  i ' m not saying ideal injera should be sour ,  but i like mine that way .    hahaha  unfortunately parts of the injera were a little dried .    * sigh *    it ' s a toss up for me between dried injera versus more sour injera .      the dishes were all decent ,  but not amazing .   my companion liked the potatoes in the carrot ,  string bean ,  potato dish .   i thought their salad was fabulous  -  fresh and dressed perfectly .   i did not care for the raw onions ,  but have to admit the taste was a nice contrast to the other dishes .   both lentil dishes were decent ,  as i have said before it is difficult for me to tell much of a difference in them .   however ,  my trusty sidekick noted that the lentils were more watery at kaffa crossing .   i know that 1 of the lentil dishes was too spicy for me ,  but i am a big ,  big wuss when it comes to spices ,  so that is neither here nor there .    the lamb was a big disappointment ,  it was a little sour  ( bad ?  )  .   the collard greens were pretty standard ,  nothing amazing .

    "text": "oh pizzeria vetri ,  how i wanted to 4 and 5 star love you -  but our night wasnt that night .  don ' t get me wrong ,  your food was decent -  the crudo was tasty and the rotolo was great but i guess the hype prior to meeting you was just a bit oversold .    service :  meh .  everyone there seemed really bored and the vibe was a bit bland .    seating :  i sat at the counter because i dislike communal seating unless i ' m at a bar .  i recommend this option if you don ' t want to sit near someone else ' s hangry toddler or if you just want to watch the pizza making magic .   food :  decent .  the pizza  ( i got the crudo )  was good and rotolo was really good but my pizza was a bit too oily and was barely warm .  other then that ,  the thin crust style pizza was well executed and all of the ingredients were fresh .  the prosciutto wasn ' t overly salty and the sauce was lovely .   i will probably go back soon to try a bit more from the menu since there were a lot of things that were appealing like the melanzana and salsiccia pizzas or the nutella pizza for dessert ,  yum .     to be continued .  .  .

    "text": "i ' ve been here several times throughout the years .  this year marks their 25th anniversary -  congratulations !   when i was a kid it was called ron ' s school house ,  but they ' ve changed the name .  my family and i came tonight to celebrate my brother ' s birthday .  we had a nice time ,  were seated quickly ,  service was friendly and attentive and we learned quickly that some of us should have stuck with what they are known for and not ventured into the extravagant choices of the menu .  my brother got a philly chicken cheese steak and a side of fire grilled vegetables ,  both of which he ' s had before and no complaints there .  my dad ordered an american meal -  chicken breast with a side of mashed potatoes and broccoli and also a caesar side salad .  he liked his meal .  my mom and i both ordered the eggplant parmasean dish with a side of spaghetti .  .  the noodles were slightly overcooked and the marinara sauce was very bland .  i tried doctoring it up by adding grated table cheese ,  it helped a little .  .  but no basil or any other spices or flavoring .  .  disappointed in that .  the actual eggplant .  .  where was it ?  it was heavily breaded and the eggplant was so thin i practically had to get a magnifying glass out to see it .  also it was fried ,  and covered it cheese -  the cheese was probably the best part .  it was so heavy from being fried and breaded .  one thing i did enjoy though was i got the butternut ,  nutmeg ,  pumpkin soup for an extra  $ 2 .  the soup was hearty ,  filling and sweet .   if you ' ve never visited ron ' s ,  i ' d recommend sticking to the ovals -  pizza ,  which is what they ' re known for .  i enjoyed the soup too ,  so check that out .  prices range from  $ 8 - 17 for lunch and dinners .  they also have a bar which stays pretty packed .  we went tonight for dinner around 6 and the bar was already full by then and the dining rooms were filling up fast .

    "text": "i tried kung fu noodle with high hopes ,  especially because the list of authentic chinese noodle / dumpling restaurants in town is pretty short .  they do eat - in or take out ,  and i hear they do delivery but i ' m not certain .    i ordered the chef sauce noodle ,  and while it was decent it just didn ' t seem  ~  $ 9 good which is what you end up paying after tax .  the dish was mostly noodles ,  lacking much of anything else .  the sauce ,  meat ,  and green onions were practically condiment portions ,  but still managed to leave a large pool of oil / grease at the bottom of the container they were placed in .  i put more sriracha on stir fry that already has sauce on it .  the noodles were decent but nothing to write home about ,  and for all i know could ' ve been bought from a store .    the people running the counter were nice but for lunch time with no one in the restaurant when i arrived ,  service was pretty slow  ( i got mine to go )  .    overall ,  kung fu noodle isn ' t bad ,  its just okay .  with china pasta house being only 10 minutes away with higher quality ,  quantity ,  homemade ,  and cheaper noodles  +  potstickers ,  i have hard time thinking i ' d choose this place first .    worth a try ,  i ' d take it over americanized chinese food any day ,  but the prices are a bit steep for what you get .

    "text": "definitely a decent taco place .  i got the fish taco plate for  $ 8 which includes 3 fish / shrimp tacos  ( i substituted 1 chicken )  ,  a 16 oz drink which includes their horchata or fresh pineapple / mango smoothie ,  and rice and beans .  the corn tortillas are definitely the best part of the meal .  they ' re thick and soft and so yummy .  the fish tacos are pretty good but the chicken was a little bland .  beans and rice .  .   eh .    overall ,  the tacos are pretty good ,  not sure if i ' ll be coming back with so many other choices .  it ' s about  $ 1 . 50 /  $ 1 . 60 a taco .    there ' re more tables inside than it would seem and also some picnic tables outside but don ' t sit out there !  between loud noises of the tire shop and the mosquito that was biting me ,  i wish i had been inside with the a / c .

    "text": "i loves me some seitan ,  and that ' s why i keep going to el camino .  the seitan wings  &  seitan nachos are so good !  unfortunately ,  the service is not .  it can be extremely slow .  on one occasion it took them so long to get my seitan nachos out to me that they had to give them to me on the house .  all of my friends were done eating and ready to leave and i was just getting my food !    as for the rest of the food at el camino ,  the only other thing i ' ve tried would be the fried pickles .  i have to say ,  i was not impressed .  i love both pickles and fried things but these were not good .  the coating was too grainy and i just didn ' t like the taste .    the seitan is so good that it keeps me coming back .  and the margaritas are pretty good too .

    "text": "chris was our server and he was great .  he seemed like the easy going kind of guy you ' d want to hang out with .  he gave us great recommendations and checked on us frequently .    the food was great .  i had the piggy mac .  pulled pork topped with rich gouda mac and cheese sprinkled with panko and baked to a crispy brown .  i ended up spooning the mac to the side so i could add puckett ' s own sweet ,  yet spicy bbq sauce to the tender ,  juicy pork .   my son  ( he ' s eight but eats like a teen )  ordered the meat plus two veggies kids plate .  he said the green beans were the best he ' s had and loved the pulled pork without and sauce .    we ate early so we missed the music  ( get there around 8pm )  but the place has great lighting and atmosphere no matter the occasion .    also ,  park in the back behind frothy monkey .  it ' s free and has more space than on the street .

    "text": "didnt think it was worth the huge line that formed outside the place while we ate .   eggs ordinary ,  bacon actually very dry and crispy ,  blueberry pancakes not that extraordinary .   all in all ,  id come back ,  but if there was the huge line outside ,  i ' d recommend to find someplace else because even though the servers are prompt and efficient ,  the whole experience was very ,  sorry to say but in my humble opinion ,  not memorable .

    "text": "so i got the memo about the 50 cents oyster @ happy hour .  .  . and during our visit to nola .  .  . we were so eager to go to eat as many oysters possible at a steal deal price !   arrived around 4ish on a hot  ( week ) day .  we both were tourists .  . wearing shorts ,  t - shirts and sandals just like most others in the bar  ( happy )  hour area .  the hostess was friendly but the waiter was just a plain @ $  $   .  .  . pardon my language here .   yup ,  we got the head to toe look and he walked around and talked to us with his nose pointing to the ceiling ,  oh ,  come on !  !  we didn ' t care really .  .  .  all we wanted were just some fresh oysters and great beer to wash away the heat .   we ordered a dozen of the oysters and the duck liver and rabbit pate  $ 8 with two glasses of beer  ( we later got a second round of beer )  .   the oysters came out slowly .  .  we almost finished our beer when they arrived .  they looked grossed and not cleaned well .  i understand it was 50 cents each .  . but they shouldn ' t cut corners on cleanliness especially while serving raw food plus they are a fancy restaurant .  . how do you expect us to come back for the pricier dinner if you can ' t even clean the oysters well ?   we were thinking to order a couple more dozens but the fact that we tasted the debris from the oyster shucking process in each oyster plus the unappetizing look of the small shells sticking on the oyster '  shells .  .  we just got turned off !   the pate was excellent and we loved the pickled cucumber etc and the warm toasted bruchetta that came with it and  $ 8 was certainly worth the priced .  we licked it clean !  !   we were planning to go to luke for a couple times during our nola visit and even considered going there for dinner  ( we watch food network and top chef masters )  but our not - so - great first  ( and only )  happy hour experience @ luke left none to desire to come back .   our total tab including tax and tip was about  $ 40 .  .  .  they get you on the alcohol .  .   the pate is a 4 to 5 stars .  . the oyster price is also a 5 stars ,  but the snotty service and lack of cleanliness didn ' t make the cut .  . so i ' m giving luke a fair 3 stars .

    "text": "i came here with a large group of people .  i don ' t feel as if this is a good place for large groups .  .  . the seating just really doesn ' t accommodate so half our party left .  those of us that remained  ( 6 of us )  ordered food and drinks .  i really enjoyed the guac and the drinks .  the tacos were just ok .  the steak was probably the best ,  followed by the pastor .  .  .  . i didn ' t even finish the shrimp and bacon one even though the waitress recommend it .  difference in taste buds i guess because i didn ' t like it at all .  this place is also extremely loud but i guess that just goes with the territory around here .  i did like that the waitress broke up our bill into individual checks without even asking !
