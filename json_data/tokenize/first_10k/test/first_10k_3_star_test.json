    "text": "i visited this restaurant 4 times during my 5 days stay .  crazy ,  right ?  here are a list of reasons/pros:   -  we were staying a nearby hotel .   -  the restaurant opens 11  -  10:30 pretty much every day including new year ' s day so it fits into our schedule .   -  if you are a party of two ,  chances are you get seated right away .   -  $9 per dozen of oysters which is a really great deal by any standard !   -  they have a seafood shop next door that sells boiled and fresh seafood to -  go .   -  our server (same) is very friendly and recognized us every single time .   now i want to talk about the reasons why i only give it 3 stars .    -  we tried a bunch of stuff which are all pretty mediocre .  raw oysters are not cleaned well .  so if your schedule is flexible ,  go to superior seafood during their happy hours for their 50 cents/oyster  -  better quality and cheaper .  turtle soup has a strange taste so i definitely prefer felix ' s .  a portion of my boiled shrimps are always mushy somhow ,  maybe boiled for too long ?  .  .  .   -  the ambient is inviting but not comfortable so we basically just finished our food and go .    -  clean the bathroom !  !   will probably visit again if we stay in the area next time or simply just pick up some seafood quickly .

    "text": "this was a tough one !    on the merits of the wine ,  fairly average .  .  .  i understand that the winery has more than one lable and other label is their premium wines .   i look forward to when that is available (i went two weeks ago so maybe it already is)     location .  .    what ' s not to like ?   on the pier !   a wonderful outdoor patio ,   couldn ' t have a nicer setting to enjoy your tasting .  .  .  .    the staff were super ,  super nice ,   i would give them an a+ !     so why only three stars ?   it is because of the wine club !   very expensive for the quality of the wines and stingy as hell with the benefits to the members .  .    most wine clubs will give you a free tasting every time you come in (after all ,  we are your best customers .  .  .  we are the ones who buy your wine time and time again) .   some wineries will give their members a complimentary glass in leau of a tasting (carr) .    most wineries allow you to bring guests which is how you get new wine club members .    this system works folks !   the way this wine club works is that you are given a very limited number of passes per quarter ,  five as i recall .    if i come with my wife once a month we wouldn ' t even be covered .  .  .  let alone if we bring a guest !      so go to this winery if you want to enjoy a tasting in one of the most beautiful settings on earth .    but avoid the wine club !   for that you can pretty much go to any of the other wine tasting rooms on the urban wine trail .

    "text": "the long and the short of it: a romantic little byob in newtown square that hits the mark in several areas .  big portions at decent prices .  you won ' t leave hungry !   and now for a full review:  i have been to this fellini ' s cafe and the one in bryn mawr several times and each time i ' ve visited there have been some memorable moments .  .  . and there have been speed bumps that keep this place from reaching its full potential .   on my latest visit this past friday night ,  i made reservations for 730 .  my beautiful wife and i arrived right at 730 .  although there were two vacant tables available ,  it took them at least 10 minutes or so to seat us .  and when they did ,  they broke up a table for 6 instead of putting us at the 2 seater .  odd .   being out and away from the kids for a few hours ,  we wanted at least a little bit of privacy ,  instead of sitting next to (pretty much connected to) a table of four .  we asked the manager if we could be moved to the 2 seater .  .  . he said fine .  another 5 - 10 minutes (too long ! ) later a member of the wait staff came and ,  without any indication as to his intentions ,  whisked up our bottle of wine and silverware and ran off to the other table .  not a problem ,  but some eye contact and a simple  ' follow me please '  with even a hint of a smile would have been lovely .  we shrugged and just rolled with it .   the interior is quaint ,  and the lighting is dim .  it ' s a nice place for a romantic meal .  but it is loud .  so loud i would say this place is kid friendly despite being in such close quarters with your neighbors .  not sure if we ' d ever try taking our four kids there (actually i ' m certain we won ' t) but one or two can be done without much trouble .   our waitress was extremely polite and offered the energy and enthusiasm that our other friend lacked .   for dinner ,  we ordered a caesar salad to share and for our main courses my wife opted for her usual tagliatelli with mushroom cream sauce and i had what i always have ,  the tortellini pasticiatti .   complimentary with the meal were two pieces of bruschetta (very nice) and a small loaf of crusty italian bread ,  which is served with butter packets (which perhaps only i find strange for an italian restaurant ? ) .    overall the food was delicious ,  except for a few somewhat minor hiccups:   1 .  the caesar salad was served on a warm plate .  the salad was excellent and would have been legendary had it been served on a chilled (or at least not warm ! ) plate .   2 .  i am pretty sure they used frozen peas in the tortellini dish ,  which is fine with me as long as you make sure the peas are thawed before you serve it !  only a few peas were not quite thawed ,  but it marred what was otherwise a perfectly crafted masterpiece of a dish .   when we paid ,  the manager allowed us to use an expired gift card .  that was a very nice gesture and one that required no push from us to induce .   all in all ,  i ' ll keep visiting fellini because it ' s relatively inexpensive and they do most everything well .

    "text": "i came in here the other night for a  post - show snack after seeing a eso performance at the winspear .  the main reason we chose this location was because it was close to the winspear ,  and open late (until 11:30pm on friday and saturday) .  i don ' t have any strong criticisms of the restaurant .  i suppose ,  if anything ,  the menu may have seemed a little bit over - priced  -  at least for what i ordered .  i had a caesar salad with three  ' jumbo '  shrimp on it ,  which cost $15 .  the portion size did not seem to justify the cost and the jumbo shrimp were fairly average in their size ,  but the flavours were good and the ingredients were fresh .  my friend had a soup ,  which looked and smelled absolutely amazing ,  and at $6 it didn ' t seem too unreasonable .  she also had the smoked salmon carpaccio ,  which looked very appetizing with its thick slices of dark rye bread and generous slices of smoked salmon and capers .  the also had a couple of interesting beers on their menu that we were keen to try .   i think if you ' re going to a show in the area and looking for a spot to get a drink or a snack afterward ,  this is not a bad option .  their menu at that time of night had an interesting mix of appetizers and desserts that seemed to provide something to suit most tastes .   i ' m assuming normand ' s bistro must be connected to the normand ' s restaurant which is on jasper avenue .  of interest ,  i have heard that normand ' s took over the brunch menu that had formerly been offered at the glenora bistro .

( i highly recommend you try that place) these were more like quesadillas laying flat where as the other ones jumped off the plate and were so much more crispy and substantial .  the last appetizer i had was the wontons in chilli oil .  these were just not good to me at all and one bite was all i needed .  basically it is steamed wontons in a bowl with the soup being the chilli oil .  just heavy heavy choking heat with very little substance or taste .  take those same homemade wontons and pan fry them with some chilli peppers and a nice light sauce and you have could a real winner but i digress .  finally we tried the talapia medallions  .  these were fried to perfection but there were some greens mixed in that i could not chew through and had to discard via the old napkin trick which to me is a bit of a deal/star breaker .   the service was very good and the atmosphere very nice but i wouldn ' t go out of my way to eat here again .  all i could think about was how much more i prefer cantonese style where its all about flavors and you can add heat as you like it .  i ' m sure i could find better authentic szechuan cuisine that better suits my taste just not here .  it feels very commercialized and americanized .  i prefer the hole in the wall places where i am the only caucasian in the place a heck of a lot more .

    "text": "the food was very good .  the reason for the three stars is the noise level .  i was with three other people in a corner table and we had to shout to hear each other .  if the restaurant could work on the noise level ,  it would absolutely get more stars .  the pad see ew got great reviews from the person who ordered it .  i got the king and i (veg/chicken/shrimp stir fry) and it was excellent .  nice heat and curry flavor .  the pad thai was a bit sweet i thought ,  but the person who ordered it really liked it .   portion sizes are not enormous .  we had some leftovers but also didn ' t come in starving .   good service ,  very attentive .  the noise level was the only negative .

    "text": "my girlfriends and i ate at the creole house for dinner .  our decision to dine here was largely based on the fact that it was pouring raining and this restaurant is next door to our hotel .  we started with the bacon garlic oysters and jumbo buffalo wings .  the bacon garlic oysters were average ,  at best .  the oysters were overpowered by the cheese and bacon ,  which was disappointing .  the buffalo wings were pretty good and seasoned well .  for entrees ,  we ordered: 1) jumbalaya pasta ,  2) blackened red fish and 3) canal street red fish .  the jumbalaya pasta lacked flavor and was our least favorite (would not order again) .  the blackened red fish was just okay and the skimpy side of saut\u00e9ed veggies (spinach ,  tomatoes ,  mushrooms) were very salty (would order again as a last resort) .  the canal street red fish wasn ' t great but my friend would order it again .  her biggest complaint was that it had very little garlic sauce .  we also ordered paddle boat drinks ,  which tasted good but were more juice vs alcohol (had to order an extra shot) .   so ,  overall ,  we were underwhelmed with the food ,  making it a solid 3 stars .  on a positive note ,  our server ,  alexander ,  was great .  .  . very hospitable and tried his best to make sure we were satisfied .

    "text": "full disclosure: i have no experience with their food (other than the free chips which ,  meh) .  the special place cactus holds in my heart is for one thing: margarita mondays .   i walked in to cactus this monday with a friend from work ,  and the bartender had a pitcher of  ' ritas going before we even sat down .  point to cactus: the staff is on top of stuff for their regular customers .   the service can be a little slow at times ,  but once we get a table full of margarita pitchers life is beautiful .  the  ' ritas themselves aren ' t the most consistent (this week ' s were a little heavy on the juice) but for $10 i ' m not complaining .  and ,  to reply to one of the posts ,  they definitely don ' t skimp on the tequila .  in fact ,  the bartender measures out the liquor for ever pitcher .  margaritas are pretty sweet so you can ' t taste it too much ,  and i ' m sure it isn ' t quite as much as you ' d get in a non - special ,  but believe me it ' s there .   my most serious gripe ,  actually ,  is the music .  don ' t know who puts the mixes on ,  but i protest .  they actually played  ' closing time '  the other night  -  at 10:00 ,  when people were still coming in .  way to send the wrong message .   it ' s not the best place around by any stretch ,  but if you ever need to unwind after a long monday ,  you ' ll find me at cactus .

    "text": "i came here with my husband and some friends to grab some drinks and hang out .  upon walking in ,  we were greeted kindly by a man ,  who we never saw again .  we sat and waited ,  checking out their menu .  the waitress/bartender came up and asked if we were ready to order ,  but since part of our party was missing ,  we asked if we could have a few minutes .  well ,  i guess a few minutes means twenty because our waitress sat at a table conversing with a couple instead of coming back to assist us .  the whole place was rather dead ,  probably since it was the day before thanksgiving .  finally ,  she came over to take our orders .  she was helpful in telling us what to avoid on the menu .  we got margaritas all around .  i had a mango margarita (i tried it both on the rocks and blended) and it was absolutely delicious !  i would return just for their fabulous mango margarita .  i heard both their strawberry and traditional margaritas were just as good as well !  (just a tip ,  avoid the banana margarita ! ) it took our waitress forever to check on us again and we ended up going up to the bar anytime we needed something .  we didn ' t even think about ordering food ,  considering the service we were receiving wasn ' t ideal .  the drinks were good and our waitress was polite ,  just not very attentive .  i still enjoyed my experience here and would consider coming back !  infact ,  i see another mango margarita in my future .

[of course ,  my father was extraordinarily pleased that he could watch the nascar race while we ate ,  so it was all good . ]  after looking over the menu ,  my mom decided to order the french dip and my dad and i decided to split a pizza - half supreme ,  half bbq chicken .  that ' s half sausage ,  pepperoni ,  bacon ,  mushroom ,  green pepper & onion and half grilled chicken ,  red onion and provel cheese with bbq sauce .  let ' s just be honest .  this was a mistake .  and the mistake was my fault .  i was the one who ordered the bbq half of the pizza and it just did not hold a candle to the  \" regular \"  half of the pizza .   yes ,  i ' ll admit that for once in my life a pizza with provel cheese on it -  - impressed me .  i didn ' t expect that !  but ,  the bbq pizza was too sweet and i ' m sad to say that we didn ' t eat much of it .   luckily ,  my dad let me have a little of his and i was so glad he did ,  because his half of the pizza was much better than mine .   the pizza had a nice crunchy crust ,  but it didn ' t crumble and fall apart like some thin crusts can .  plus ,  the sauce was really good .  nice and tangy .  in fact ,  i believe that the menu said that this was rachel ray ' s favorite pizza sauce -  - and who can argue with that ?   all in all ,  it was just good pizza .  no ,  not the *best* i ' d ever had ,  but good .  plus ,  it was pretty big too - definitely enough to share .  so either go in expecting left overs or take a big appetite .   now that we ' ve talked pizza ,  let ' s talk about the [unexpected] best part of the meal .  my mom ' s french dip sandwich .   thin ,  juicy ,  sliced roast beef served with its own au jus and melted provel cheese on french bread .  this sandwich was very moist and very flavorful .  i would have to describe it as comfort food .  .  .  to the point where i am seriously look forward to going there in the winter and having one .   plus ,  once again ,  i ' m proud to say that i enjoyed the provel cheese on this dish !  *gasp ! * maybe st .  louis is stealing my soul .  .  .  .  or maybe joey b ' s just knows how to use juuuustttt enough provel to bring the flavor palette in without overwhelming the taste buds .  yeah ,  i ' ll go with the second option .   other menu items that we selected included onion rings (very heavily breaded ,  but pretty good .  .  .  your standard onion rings) and side salads (again ,  the provel cheese was good on these salads .  shocking ! ) .  it was all just very satisfying ;  a nice hearty ,  savory meal .   so ,  what ' s the final judgement ?  the food was good (and partially changed my mind about provel cheese) ,  the service friendly ,  and the atmosphere upbeat but not super exciting .  i ' d have to grade joey b ' s like this:  food: a -  atmosphere: b service: a price: $ portion size: large  it truly seemed like a great place to grab a pizza and a couple beers and hang out with your friends .  i definitely plan on returning and you should check it out too .  let me know what you think when you go !   happy eating !

    "text": "this is a good place to get a take out lunch if you are in the mood for something healthy .  i would not recommend eating there because seating is limited and there are crowds of people waiting to order/pick up their take out meals .   rittenhouse square is just a few steps away and that ' s where i go to eat my lunch .   the lady sitting next to me on the bench remarked how good my food smelled .    everything on the menu at hip city veg is vegan ,  though even if you are not vegan/vegetarian i would recommend it because the food tastes really good !   i liked the udon noodle salad with faux - chicken .  i ' ve also had the ziggy burger which i thought was pretty good for a veggie burger (loved the fresh tomato ,  lettuce and onion) but especially enjoyed the sweet potato fries i had as a side .   there are also some interesting drinks .  there is a  \" groothie \"  which is a greens and fruit smoothie .  personally i thought it was just ok and not that thirst quenching ,  but it seemed like a lot of people were ordering it so i tried it .   i preferred the green lemonade (lemonade plus kale ,  sweetened with agave) ,  which was both delicious and refreshing !    overall i ' d recommend hip city veg and plan to go back !

    "text": "i had high expectations when i went to this place recently after some recommendations from friends .   we visited on a night when there weren ' t very crowded so it was nice to be able to have such an attentive waitress and service .   i was a bit disappointed when i didn ' t find as much on the menu as i would have liked to have seen that would appeal to me .   i guess i have become very picky with my yelp addiction in terms of scrutinizing every establishment i go to pretty thoroughly .     i ordered the hummus appetizer for the table and was very pleased at the quality of the dish .   for my entree i ordered their bricks salad which had plenty of fresh produce packed in .   i ordered a double portion of chicken for it ,  which still seemed pretty skimpy especially since i was charged for that request .   overall ,  i ' d say this is probably one of ybor ' s lesser known spots as its more on the western edge of the main strip ,  yet it seems very lively and upbeat .   i did like that they had featured lots of artwork by various local artists that were on display and offerred for sale .   not a bad place to hang out and have a drink if you ' re looking for a lower key outing in the ybor area .

    "text": "i guess i ' m listed as a  \" picky \"  reviewer on yelp ,  but this place could be 4 stars if they would address the service problems .  walked in at 7:30 ,  gave the name and waited .  soon there were over a dozen people standing in the waiting area for tables .  after 15 minutes the lady i gave my name to came over and asked what the name was again .  i asked if we could sit at the 2 top that had been vacant since we walked in and she looked at the empty table and said sure .  ok ,  but why couldn ' t we be seated before that ?  ?  ?  i do want to add that in between taking names ,  she was answering the phone ,  pouring coffee ,  ringing up checks and bussing tables .  this place sorely needs a host or hostess .  the couple that came in right behind us waited over 20 minutes to be seated ,  and there was another 2 top open behind us .  i don ' t get it .  anyway ,  the waiter came by ,  opened the wine and told us about the specials .  i guess its picky if you want the wine opened and then given a few minutes to relax before hearing the specials .  anyway ,  another man came by several minutes later and asked if we were told the specials .  we asked for a few minutes and he was very nice and said sure no problem .  i will get to the food ,  but you have to read what else took place to understand why they need someone to co - ordinate the staff .  a waitress brought the appetizers and when we were almost done ,  yet another waitress brought us bread with dipping sauce .  been nice to get the bread first .  the dinner was brought out by a different waitress .  at the end of the meal the a waitress brought by the dessert cart  ,  which we passed on .  the original waiter stopped by to ask about dessert ,  i said no thanks ,  but we would like the check .  in between we kept trying to get someone ' s attention because we had asked to take part of an entree home .  the waiter was way to busy and basically blew us off ,  one of the waitress '  also passed by ,  but we couldn ' t get her to stop .  finally the man that seemed to be the manager came by and he took care of it .  ok ,  that ' s the bad news and maybe they were shorthanded  ,  but a lot of other yelpers note the same problem with service issues .  people shouldn ' t have to sit and wait 15 - 30 minutes for a table .  if this wasn ' t byo ,  then you could always go sit at a bar and have a drink .  the other thing is ,  no one offered to open the wine while we were waiting , as many byo ' s will do if they can ' t seat you on time .  nor ,  did anyone say sorry about the wait .  the food was very good ,  even as picky as i am .  the shrimp tempura was serving of 5 very large gulf shrimp atop a very flavorful asain slaw .  the duo ,  which consists of a crabcake slider and a sirloin slider was great .  the crabcake was moist and had ample pieces of lump crabmeat .  the sirloin slider was excellent ,  could of eaten a lot of those .  the entree ' s were also top notch .  the special grouper with beans and crab was moist ,  cooked perfectly and had a nice red pepper sauce on the bottom .  as most of the reviews talk about here ,  the lobster ravioli is as good as anywhere in this area .  the pasta was light ,  the ravioli was stuffed with lobster meat and the sauce was great .  like i said ,  take care of the service and seating issues and this is a 4 star .  they do have their own lot ,  but you probably will have to park across the street if it ' s a weened night .  i was glad i put this address in the nav system because at night and the first time there it ' s a little hard to find .  will give them another try in hopes the service improves .

    "text": "i went to milktooth over the weekend and i really wanted to love it but it was just okay .   i read through a few of the reviews before going and wasn ' t surprised that they were out of the fried chicken when i got there .   i wasn ' t planning on ordering it anyway but someone in my group tried to .     i ended up going with the lamb patty melt and while it was good .  .  . it wasn ' t great .   i love having an egg on my sandwich so that was a highlight .   the lamb wasn ' t that great and it tasted like they combined the lamb meat with some sort of sausage but it don ' t state so on the menu .    the french fries were good but nothing special .   the lamb stew was the other item i was considering getting so maybe it would be worth going back and trying that .     if you ' re a vegetarian you probably want to avoid this place all together because it ' s not very veggie friendly .   and don ' t think you can go and order something (like the waffle) without the bacon because your requests for revisions will be  \" politely declined \"  as it states on the menu .    i like that they tell you ahead of time but it doesn ' t seem like it would be a terrible thing to request that the cook doesn ' t sprinkle the bacon on top of the waffle .    they do have some very interesting drinks and i would consider going there to grab a coffee because the process for coffee seemed to be quite intricate .     i will say that the their menu has changed since they opened and a lot of what was mentioned in previous reviews is no longer on the menu .

    "text": "i got a craving for a turkey burger and was in the area .   it had been over half a year since my last bad experience ,  so i thought i ' d give it another shot .   i am happy to say that i didn ' t regret it .   i have been back another time since then and the service has been excellent .   our orders were taken promptly ,  the correct food arrived ,  and my burger and fries were hot and fresh .   i tried the mushroom burger with turkey and it was loaded with mushrooms .   the server even brought us fries while we waited because it was taking longer than ten minutes .   she made sure to keep our water glasses full .   if you can ,  try to sit in janesca ' s section ,  and you will be well taken care of .         the other servers i had gotten bad service from still work there as i saw a few of them walking around .   hopefully they have improved since my bad experiences .   the only other complaint i have is this place really needs to be dusted !   it doesn ' t look dirty other than that ,  but where the carousel horses are along - side the booths is coated with a thick layer of dust .   if they fix that ,  i would come back more often .

(definitely not a marketing scheme ,  but i admire the game even though we ' re being played . )  to get to the point: the first thing i tried was the icing .  .  it was literally so hard i had to dig my teeth into it to get a bite .  i feel like i would ' ve like it if it was softer and more like icing ?  the chocolate cake was like any other .  my fianc\u00e9e ' s cupcake was strange !  !  the icing literally tasted like stale ,  natural butter (or maybe more closely similar to lard !  ?  if you ever tasted lard ,  you ' ll know that distinct flavor it has . ) the icing was also hard as a rock .  however ,  the lavender mixed (don ' t know what with) cake wasn ' t half bad ,  though nothing stood out to me as special .   iffy on whether or not we ' ll be back .  i want to like this place ,  but that just might be the pastry enthusiast in me talking .

    "text": "i have been driving passed fellini ' s on west chester pike for some time now .  today i decided that it was time to stop by and have lunch here .  the lunch prices are great ,  most meals average around $10 .  they offer a good selection of choices for lunch .  .  .  pasta dishes ,  antipasto ,  salads ,  pizzas ,  paninis etc .  i opted for a panini -  the  \" el patrizio \"  .  which consisted of grilled chicken ,  portobello mushrooms ,  spinach and provolone .  when i think of a panini ,  i picture a sandwich all melted together with grill marks on the sides of the bread .  this was more of just a normal sandwich on nice thick bread .  it also came with lettuce ,  tomato and onions on it ,  which i was not aware came with the panini .  the sandwich tasted good ,  just not what i had expected .  it came with a side salad (great honey mustard dressing) and homemade chips (favorite part of my meal) .   i left full and satisfied .  i felt that i definitely got my moneys worth out of this meal .  i would return !

    "text": "i really want to love this place ,  but they make it so hard .  the past three times in a row i ' ve been there ,  there has been some sort of ridiculous customer service issue that left me and whoever i was with super annoyed .   starting with the good: the coffee is delicious .  the assortment of baked goods is great .  .  . quiche is yummy ,  etc .  i ' ve always loved the space .  .  . good mixture of comfy couches and real seating where people can sit and work on laptops .  plenty of outdoor seating on nice days .   the prices are .  .  . steep .  but i always feel good about supporting a local small business ,  so whatever .  my real problem is the  ' tude and just general lack of professionalism that i ' ve seen from the baristas .  they clearly know their coffee ,  and that ' s great ,  but here are some of the more ridiculous things that have happened to me there in the past month:   -  - purchased coffee with my mom and went to add our cream and sugar .  my mom realized the half and half container was empty and gave the guy behind the counter a head ' s up .  his answer:  \" yeah ,  we ' re actually out of half and half .  \"  everyone stared blankly at him ,  including the other people in line .  now mind you ,  it was before noon ,  not five minutes before they closed .  no apology ,  no  \" i ' m so sorry ,  we sent someone down the street to the 7 - 11 (literally down the street) to pick some up ,  they should be back any minute .  \"  that was it .  the guy behind us asked ,   \" is anyone going to get some more ?  \"  and the kid literally shrugged his shoulders and turned his back to us .  ummmmmm .  as my mom said ,  when you charge people $8 for two coffees (one of which was just a drip coffee) ,  i don ' t think it ' s too much to ask that you provide half and half at your coffee shop .     -  - another time i was there ,  a friend asked for her coffee extra hot ,  and then when it arrived just warm ,  she asked if they could nuke it in the microwave for a minute .  she was very nice about it .  the girl behind the counter ,  on the other hand ,  felt it necessary to explain in a condescending tone for five minutes that they  \" actually can ' t put the coffee cups in the microwave \"  for some reason i now forget ,  and then reluctantly offered to add some hot water .  uhhhh .  homegirl .  could you maybe just take the coffee and solve the problem ?  put it in a to go cup and microwave it ?  this doesn ' t seem like that hard of a problem to solve ,  nor can i imagine it ' s the first time someone has asked for their coffee extra hot .  again ,  everyone in line sort of looked at each other helplessly as this happened .     -  - this is a small thing ,  but they have multiple sizes for every drink on their board ,  but then half of them apparently only come in one size ?  i know it ' s a small issue ,  but you ' d think it would occur to someone to change the menu so they don ' t have to keep telling people (last time i was there it happened to both me and the woman behind me) .    jersey java owners ,  please give your baristas some basic lessons in customer service .  again ,  they know their coffee ,  and they ' re generally nice until there ' s any sort of minor hiccup ,  and then all basic common sense goes right out the window .  your coffee is too expensive for me to have some ordeal every time i go there .  oh ,  and buy more half and half .

    "text": "let me say right off ,  i ' m not a bbq fan and by that i mean pork bbq .  so what did i order ,  the chicken sandwich ,  of course .  the buns looked yummy but i passed on them and ate the chicken and slaw from the sandwich with what i guess was their white bbq sauce (looked light orange) .  the chicken was on the rare side and the slaw was meh .  i ordred the grit casserole and green beans for my sides .  the green beans were fresh and the grits were yummy .  my friends ordered the special of the day  -  rib sandwich and they raved about it along with the baked beans and chilled bean salad .  the atmosphere is good and i loved the deck for outdoor dining .  they had a great selection of sides and i ' d be happy just eating them next time .  i ' d give it another try even though i wasn ' t wowed .

    "text": "there was a time when all i wanted to do was have an old fashioned at pub and kitchen ,  eat some meatloaf and take in my ipod playlist on the speakers .   it ' s changed considerably .   i don ' t know if the food quality dropped with the economy ,  but even their burgers are failing .   the only thing i recently had there with which i was impressed was sauteed swiss char with almonds and cranberries .   (it was really well cooked with no bitter and all the flavor ,  just like char is supposed to taste) .   their oysters are good if you ' re lucky enough to get there on a west coast day ,  but even then ,  they seem to get the small batches .    a real regret is that whatever bartender made me fall in love with the old fashioned has since wandered into a place of cheap watered down bourbon and cloying bitters .   a real shame for a bourbon cherry to go bad in a drink like that .    oh ,  and who took the doughnuts ?   really ?   of all the dessert items ,  you took the homemade doughnuts with chocolate dipping sauce ?   for shame !  i ' m hoping that as the winter rolls closer ,  we ' ll see the meatloaf again ,  with mushy peas ,  and mashed potatoes like a good simple urban hipster bar should class up .   for now ,  meh on all fronts except the neat interior and pretty awesome wait staff .

    "text": "i ' ve been wanting to take my girlfriend out on a romantic date to a good italian restaurant .  i thought i ' d give caruso ' s on 4th ave a try .   there were three hostesses when we arrived .  i told one of them that i would like a booth for two .  one of the girls made a strange look on her face that was either confused ,  annoyed or both .  i couldn ' t tell between the two expressions .  one of the hostesses takes us to a table .  i told her i had asked for a booth and i thought that was where we were going because she didn ' t acknowledge a booth wasn ' t available .  that ' s when i figured out why one of the girls made a strange look .   ** just a heads up .  caruso ' s only takes reservations on large parties .  makes sense .  but i still would have liked putting my name down to get a booth **  shortly after we sat down our server came over and introduced himself .  forgot his name .  but he was a decent fellow and was very knowledgeable about what was on the menu .   i went in the establishment craving a cold beer .  the beer menu lacked variety .  it didn ' t entice me .  instead i ended up ordering a regular iced tea .  the glass was huge ,  which is always great !   ** keep in mind that it can be a little loud in the restaurant sometimes .  **  i ended up ordering the caruso special ,  which consisted of a ton of italian spaghetti specialties .  it was delicious !  however ,  i did not feel like i got enough bang for my buck due to the rather small plate size .  i wanted more for the $10 . 75 i put down for my meal .   don ' t get me wrong .  .  .  caruso ' s is still a good restaurant .  but i will be thinking about my other options before i go back .

    "text": "john besh .  brunch .  you ' d think you ' d be in creole heaven ,  but the experience was a bit dissatisfying .    i ordered the friday express ,  which included a soup or salad and an entree .  i forget what it ' s called but it contained shrimp ,  oyster and a tiny crab claw .  it was okay .  nothing stood out .    after eating the shrimp and grits at cafe amelia ,  we were excited to see how others compared .  at luke ,  you get a sizable portion and it ' s good but not great .    overall ,  there were better samplings of brunch and creole food elsewhere .

    "text": "i was craving a burger ,  and since we ' d driven past this place a few times ,  we decided to check it out !   pros: the chili cheese fries were really good !  the chili tasted and looked homemade (not the canned stuff) and was a huge portion .  that could have been my entire meal by itself .   cons: the worst thing was that the cashier was also assembling the food when she wasn ' t handling the money .  she did not wash her hands or wear gloves after touching people ' s cash and credit cards ,  itching her nose ,  wiping sweat off her forehead .  .  .  .  .  . and then just going straight back to arranging hamburger buns with their fixings with her bare dirty hands .  gross .  nobody else seemed to notice ,  nor care .    the burgers were just okay .  not bad ,  but we were expecting better .    the wait was soooo long .  we must have stood there waiting for over 25 minutes ( for two burgers ,  chili fries ,  and cheese fries) .    it was about a half hour before closing and they were not allowing anyone to sit inside at the tables because they ' d already been cleaned for the day .  there were only two picnic tables outside to sit at .  one man came in a little while before closing ,  and they told him they couldn ' t serve him .  since they were obviously still cooking and serving other people (that had arrived earlier) ,  he was not happy .  he stormed out and said ,   \" fine buddy ,  but you ' ve just lost a customer \"  .   i get that they were closing soon ,  but what ' s one more order before locking the doors ?   despite all the cons ,  i loved the chili cheese fries so much that i will be going back for more !  we just won ' t be getting any burgers .  i ' d like to try their milkshakes and their pesto chicken sandwich ,  too .

    "text": "still without a sign ,  this han location might be a bit difficult to find .   we managed to spot it and doubled back .   unfortunately ,  the kitchen had just closed .   luckily ,  they were willing to prepare us something to go .   we kept it simple on them and ordered the dan dan noodles .     don ' t take the 3 - star review the wrong way ,  the food was great .   however ,  it seemed no where near as good as the manayunk location ,  which i also tried shortly after it first opened .   considering it was to - go and knowing han doesn ' t put out 3 - star food ,  i ' ll be back (when the kitchen is open) to give them another shot at boosting the score .
