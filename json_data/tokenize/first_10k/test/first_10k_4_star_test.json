    "text": "the only reason i didn ' t give this restaurant a 5 star rating ,  is because of one single pretentious waiter .  as a 4 night guest at hotel palomar ,  the location of the restaurant is an obvious plus .  the first night of my stay ,  i met a coworker in the restaurant for a cocktail .  when we arrived ,  the host staff were busy and not available ,  so we just walked in .  the restaurant was not too busy ,  so we just looked at a small table next to the bar and proceeded to take a seat .  a waiter came by and i quickly asked if we could have a seat ,  before sitting down and told him we ' d only be having cocktails .  he stumbled on his reply ,  and in an irritated / in - convinced tone ,  told me  \" i guess it would be fine \"  and basically just kept walking mid sentence .  my guest and i brushed it off ,  and started having a conversation while looking at the drink menu .  to make a long story short ,  he was distant and we both got the  \" couldn ' t be bothered \"  vibe from him .  when it came to the bill ,  we asked if it could be split due to company transaction policies ,  and you would have thought asked him for some inconceivable task .  we basically spent the rest of our night and elevator ride to our room in shock of the rudeness we had just experienced .    although that situation left a bad taste in our mouth ,  and the night before we decided to avoid the restaurant ,  we decided to grab another cocktail and give this place one more try .  after looking around and ensuring  \" last nights waiter \"  wasn ' t on shift ,  we walked over to the bar and started looking over the menu .  instantly ,  the bartender greeted us with pleasant small talk and made us feel 100 %  welcome .  he asked about our day ,  recommended cocktails and was a completely genuine person .  this guy  ( i think his name was ben )  is an absolute star !  he gave us lessons on whiskey ,  described how to make classic cocktails ,  and was 100 %  invested in our experience .  this is exactly what a bartender at a 4 / 5 star establishment should be  -  actually he exceeds that .  he was kind ,  funny ,  friendly and completely redeemed this restaurant / bar from our terrible experience the night before .   i also ordered room service last night from this restaurant ,  and it was amazing .  the bacon wrapped dates and chocolate cake are to die for !  great restaurant and amazing bartender ( s )  .  too bad one bad egg could have spoiled this experience .

    "text": "my boyfriend and i both decided to try jesse ' s for the first time after we ' d both grown up in the brandon area and neither of us had ever been ,  and really hadn ' t heard much about the restaurant .    we dined on a saturday night and even though the parking lot and restaurant was packed ,  we were sat right away at a 2 - top next to a window facing sr - 60 .    our server ,  nikki ,  greeted us in a reasonable amount of time .  we ordered our beverages and she brought them shortly after that .  something i did not like was there was not a drink menu on the table ,  but nikki was able to tell us what beers were on draft and non - alcoholic drinks .  she took our appetizer and entree order all at once .    we ordered crab stuffed mushrooms and a french onion soup to share .  these items came out together .  the crab stuffed mushroom was basically a giant thing of crab stuffing on a tiny mushroom ,  which was almost laughable ,  but had a good flavor nonetheless .  the french onion soup had a great flavor and wasn ' t scalding hot ,  which was super nice to eat right away .    after our appetizer came out and we finished it ,  our caesar salads came out as well as a loaf of bread and some butter .  this was also really great pacing of our meal !  nikki never let empty plates sit on our table ,  was very attentive ,  and always made sure we had drinks in front of us .  the caesar salads were good .  i gave the bread two chances .  .  .  once dipped in the french onion soup and once just with butter on it .  .  .  the bread could have definitely been better  -  it just didn ' t have a good flavor to it .    i ordered the 6 oz filet and he ordered the 16 oz delmonico  -  both cooked medium rare .  the steaks are served with saut\u00e9ed mushrooms ,  your choice of side ,  and a salad or soup of the day ,  which isn ' t mentioned anywhere on the menu .  i got broccoli as my side and my boyfriend got a sweet potato with all the fixings .  i saw three tables sat after us receive their entrees before us  -  i don ' t know if it was a kitchen issue or something else ,  but we were sat at least five minutes before each of those tables  -  i tried to make sense of the delay ,  but it honestly wasn ' t a big deal to me .  our steaks came out on hot metal plates that were inserted into a cooler outer shell .  my filet was nice and thick and cooked perfectly and the broccoli was steamed very tenderly ,  but there were not enough saut\u00e9ed mushrooms on the plate ,  in my opinion .  if i had known it would have been like five mushrooms with the steak ,  i totally would have gotten them as a side .  my boyfriend ' s steak was cooked perfectly as well ,  but being on the hot metal dish led the steak to cook more at the table ,  which he wasn ' t particularly pleased with .  he enjoyed his sweet potato with butter ,  but it didn ' t come out with cinnamon on it like he requested .    anyway ,  i am sure we will return !  our server ,  nikki ,  was fabulous .  she was extremely attentive ,  had a great attitude ,  and was knowledgeable !

    "text": "stopped here last week while in the area from burbank .  had read about it on trip advisor .  it is in a great location ,  quiet ,  peaceful and cool under the shade of the big old trees .  for its location and it being noon on a thursday we were surprised to find there was literally only one table open when we walked in .  food is served pretty quick though so it didn ' t seem anyone was really waiting .   based on reviews we had read ,  my hubby had the tri - tip sandwich .  i ordered the buffalo burger .  i have to say that was one of the best burgers i have ever had in my life .  as usual ,  we traded tastes of our orders .  my hubby was so jealous of my buffalo burger and i heard about it several more times throughout the day ,  that he should ' ve got the burger .  the tri - tip was quite dry ,  and it was literally just the meat on bread ,  big bread .   the horseradish sauce  ( served on the side )  was very tasty though .  for the tri - tip ,  i give a 3 ,  hubby gives a 4 .  we both give the buffalo burger a definite 5 +  +  .   either way ,  worth checking out if you want something with a unique atmosphere and that is away from town but not a long drive .  very peaceful .

    "text": "dearest reader ,   please allow me to hereby confirm the rumors :  village whiskey does ,  in fact ,  have the best burger in philadelphia .  and ,  i should note ,  some of the best bartenders .    as my wife and i sat at the bar waiting for our friends to arrive ,  i marveled at the infinite selection of whiskeys and bourbons .  i decided that this ,  self ,  is the day you will begin liking whiskey .  so i petitioned the bartender to  \" make me something awesome with whiskey in it .  \"   \" what kind of drink do you want ?  ,  \"  he inquired .   \" i have no idea ,  good sir .  you see ,  i am a neophyte ,  a tyro ,  and fledgling when it comes to spirits such as these .  \"   ( perhaps my banter wasn ' t quite at this level at the time ;  i was already a few drinks in from my visit to franklin mortgage ,  but this is how i remember it going .  )  so ,  he thought about it for a while and proceeded to mix up the craziest drink i had ever seen  -  -  it had whiskey ,  orange bitters ,  an egg white ,  portuguese red wine ,  and other stuff in it !  the verdict :  delicious .  i also had the  \" the commodore \"  off the drink menu ,  and it was very good ,  too .  the drinks are a little pricey here ,  and they will set you back around  $ 11 or  $ 12 each .   when our friends arrived ,  we were seated outside and i got to try to village burger and the short - rib and cheddar duck - fat fries .  the burger ,  which comes with an artfully restrained dollop of homemade thousand island dressing ,  was unbelievable .  the applewood bacon and the dressing served the elevate the already - incredible taste of the meat .  i can ' t wait to come back and order another one .  as for the fries ,  they were very good ,  but i think next time i will stick with the plain duck fat fries .  our friends ordered those ,  and they were super crispy and delicious .   warning :  this place gets insanely busy ,  so you might have to wait a pretty long time for a table .    all in all ,  the drinks were great ,  the food was delectable ,  and the staff was very knowledgeable and personable .  i would totally come back .   still dreaming of that burger ,  chris m .

    "text": "so our most recent visit earlier this month was very disappointing ,  however we received an email from the company ' s guest service ,  followed by a call from the hermitage o ' charley ' s manager chris who was very professional and apologetic about our experience and asked that we give his location another try on them .  so i convinced my husband to do so .  here ' s how this 2nd chance went :  :  absolutely wonderful .  chris asked that we let him know when we wanted to give the restaurant a second chance ,  but we decided not to .  we didn ' t want any special attention .  we wanted real unreviewed service .   we were seated in the bar because it was a very  busy night ,  regardless of that the server was very attentive and had a great personality .  our food came out in a timely manner ,  well prepared and delicious .  we have since then been back several times and service continues to remain great .

    "text": "if you are looking to be impressed by french - german dishes in new orleans ,  please go to luke restaurant ,  i know i was .    the restaurant is located in the central business district ,  next to the hilton and in the former masonic temple building ,  so there is that historic vibe to the restaurant .  the front room is a lot more grand than the back room  ( where we were seated )  ,  but that is offset by views of the open kitchen .    apparently they only want to seat people with reservations ,  so since we did not have one ,  we were refused seating until 9 : 15pm  ( it was 6 : 45pm )  but with a little back and forth ,  we ended up waiting only 15 minutes before we were seated .  however ,  as we walked through the restaurant to the back room ,  way too many tables were empty that it made no sense that they acted that way .  a lot of tables still remained empty throughout the meal .   i decided to start out my meal with a cocktail .  i originally wanted the mint julep but they were out so i had the riverbend  ( vodka ,  lemon juice ,  basil syrup ,  blueberries  &  ginger ale )  at the recommendation of the server .  it was a relatively sweet cocktail ,  with the ginger ale being the most powering flavor ,  but you could still taste the alcohol .   my friend choose a regular starter and ordered a cup of the crawfish bisque .  she ate all of it so i am assuming she liked it ,  but she did complain of a sour aftertaste .   my boyfriend skipped the appetizers and went straight for the entree .  he always seems to find the most basic item on the menu and order it .  he had the luke burger  ( bacon ,  caramelized onions ,  tomatoes ,  swiss cheese )  and was raving about it .  one thing i can tell you ,  it was a very good size .    my friend had the jumbo louisiana shrimp  \" en cocotte \"  with lump crab meat ,  roasted jalape\u00f1o cheese grits ,  andouille  &  green onion sausages .  she loved it .   i have an obsession with mussels so i had the classic moules et frites .  although only having two simply ingredients  ( garlic  &  thyme )  in the broth ,  the flavors stood out and the taste was a lot bolder than others i have had with a lot more ingredients .  the house - made fries were scrumptious .  these are the best kind .   even with all that food ,  we still made room for dessert .  we first had the bread pudding which was delicious but quite sweet .  i am also not a fan of over sauced foods .   one wasn ' t enough so we also ordered the bourbon vanilla bean creme brulee .  it was superb and not too sweet which is a plus for me .  the little cookies on top added nothing to the dessert and if anything could have been left off .   all that good food ,  i still have to give props to our server .  he was amazing and engaging .  the front desk soured the mood a little bit a first but he more than made up for it .  i couldn ' t have asked for anyone better .

    "text": "excellent food and bar .  slow service .   a friend and i stopped here during an evening of bar hopping in the cbd .  we were seated promptly and given our menus ,  which are half - french ,  half - english .  not a big deal for anyone who can read french and / or has been living in louisiana for a reasonable amount of time ,  but definitely something tourists should be wary of .  i didn ' t have any alcohol because i was the designated driver ,  but i can say that their drink menu is extensive ,  and the bar was packed from the moment we arrived until the moment we left .    this restaurant ' s biggest strength is it ' s food .  i tasted their crab bisque ,  and had poulet grand - m\u00e8re as my entr\u00e9e .  both were excellent .  the latter arrived in a wide cast - iron bowl ,  which i ' m sure has a more proper name ,  but was an interesting touch nonetheless .   the service was why i gave this restaurant 4 / 5 instead of 5 / 5 .  most of the wait staff seemed to be interns from culinary school .  the handful we dealt with were very friendly ,  but would do well to be a little more attentive .  for example ,  the server who brought us our desserts ran off before we could ask for spoons to eat the dessert with .    in summary ,  a good dining experience ,  but i think i would rather continue exploring new restaurants in the area before returning .

    "text": "came here for sunday brunch and walked away with a very full belly and a good buzz !    their brunch buffet includes tons of seafood ,  an omelet station ,  pasta bar ,  carving station ,  custom sushi rolls ,  fresh fruit ,  salads ,  and the usually breakfast foods you ' d expect at a buffet .  i almost forgot dessert .  .  . an entire side of the room is dedicated to a table full of desserts and a chocolate fountain .  the brunch price also include bottomless mimosas which were literally bottomless .  our server never let us empty our glasses and  the mimosas were very heavy on the champagne ,  so we all got a bit tipsy .  at least the alcohol let us forget how much weight we gained during this meal .   as if the buffet spread wasn ' t enough ,  they also have an a la carte menu with small dishes .  the choices included belgian waffles ,  french toast ,  blintzes ,  mahi ,  and a few other savory dishes .   you can order as many of these items as you want ,  as many times as you want .  our server was sure to remind us of this ,  she seemed to enjoy watching how gluttonous our table was !    unfortunately we were here during tropical storm debby ,  so we didn ' t get to enjoy a beautiful view of the bay ,  although ,  being here while the weather was so awful was very cozy with the fireplace and wood interior .  thanks to the weather it wasn ' t crowded either ,  so don ' t write this place off on account of bad weather .    at  $ 35 a person ,  the sunday brunch seems pricey ,  but if you have no qualms about overeating and overdrinking ,  you ' ll definitely get your money ' s worth .

    "text": "when giving friends from out of town a tour of the french quarter ,  one can only expect they want some classic new orleans dishes .  i ' ve been here a couple of times ,  but they were the ones that wanted to go ,  due to their lunch special .  it ' s a nice ,  well know restaurant that offers a 17 . 00 lunch special that includes a soup or salad ,  entree ,  and the option for a 4 . 00 bloody mary or martini .  i got the bloody mary and it was a great size for the price .  it was spicy and hit the spot .  they text message you when your table is ready ,  so were able to walk around the quarter while we waited .  thank god a lot of restaurants are getting rid of the those buzzers that make you feel like you are under house arrest .   we sat down to a beautiful table right by the open shutters .  the servers ,  were ok .  they were busy ,  but forgot a couple of things we asked for .  it was still a great experience though !  i got the pork chop with red beans and the turtle soup .  the turtle soup was one of the best i have had .  the pork chop was cooked to perfection and the read beans were seasoned very well .  it came with cornbread ,  but it was very dry .  after this lunch at noon ,  i didn ' t find myself hungry till it was basically time for bed .  it was a very generous portion and well worth the money .   muriel ' s is a great way to get a classic ,  good quality new orleans meal at a decent price .  the location is spectacular ,  and the history behind the restaurant made for great conversation at the table .  definitely check it out if you are in the quarter !

( ok ,  so i just glanced over at simon e .  ' s review of this same wawa and he says the vibe is upbeat ,  and that is def .  true !   friendly staff who seem happy to work there !   and getting a wave in the always packed parking lot is indeed a common occurrence .  )   gripes :   parking .   i never even try to park in the front lot anymore .   i either walk to wawa ,  or if i am driving ,  i park in the back lot .   yes ,  wawa has a second lot ,  behind the store .   almost always an open spot .   often times ,  there is 5 - 10 open spots back there .     gripes continued :   often there are panhandlers .   not really wawa ' s fault ,  i mean we are talking germantown ave ,  in philadelphia proper ,  it is a reality .   there have not been any aggressive panhandlers since 2014 ,  so this is not a concern really any longer .   major points for :     * seasonal specialties !   i look forward to autumn for the pumpkin cannoli dip and chips !   i also dig the apple cider donuts and to a lesser degree the pumpkin donuts .     * prices !   everything is reasonable !   some stuff is cheap !   * selection !   good choice for candy ,  chips ,  snacks ,  healthy snacks / protein bars ,  drinks ,  etc .   * for the massive volume that the store does ,  the lines usually move very fast and efficiently ,  and 2nd registers open up lightning fast when they are needed !   * the store is clean from my point of view .   it is a busy ,  busy store ,  but i never see any mess on the floor or coffee station or food station .   i do not eat any of the hot food .   low quality ,  i steer clear .      for a convenience store that is open 24 hours ,  wawa is awesome !     does this one have a bathroom ?   i never used it ,  i never checked .  .  .  . but maybe there is no bathroom for customers there !   maybe it is around back ?   hmmm .   i would avoid using it anyway .    also ,  this wawa could never have gas pumps ,  traffic is already congested between allens lane and mt .  airy avenue along germantown ave .    ( between wawa and the bank of america on the corner .  )  overall :   this place is awesome based on the music selection and friendly staff working 24 / 7 .   this store does a lot right ! ",

( if you ' re flying in for a weekend ,  i really recommend renting a car -  i have no idea how we would have gotten around otherwise .  )    parking was outrageously expensive so we parked in some shopping center across the street and walked in .  it was maybe a 10 minute walk ,  but you ' re mostly walking through nicely manicured opryland foliage so it ' s a nice walk .   the hotel was a sight to behold -  huge glass ceilings ,  indoor river ,  many ,  many restaurants inside which had an  \" outdoor \"  feel because of the massive atrium .  we took a boat ride given by  \" delta river boat tours \"  which was a cute little boat on a track in their indoor river with a sweet southern tour guide letting us in on all the  \" fascinating \"  facts about the hotel .  she told everything as if it was the most amazing fact that had ever left her lips :   \" here we have the original interior wall of the hotel .  .  .  it was built in nineteen seventy seven !  \"   ( so old !  )  or ,  our favorite ,   \" here in the hotel we have an indoor swimming pool ,  so that you can swim all year round \"   ( you mean ,  inside the building ?  impossible !  )    anyway ,  it was hilarious .  seems like a nice place just to see / have a drink /  maybe dinner if prices aren ' t insane .  extra star for our tour guide who we still laugh about .

    "text": "i ' d heard the hype .  seen the ny times article .  nevertheless i was skeptical .  mainly because most people have at best ,  two reference points for donuts ,  dunkin donuts or krispy kreme .  neither of which really makes truly great donuts .   so after waiting for the crowds to die down a little ,  i traveled over to see for myself last saturday .   it ' s a small shop that blends into the surrounding neighborhood .  inside there are a couple of seats at the counter and a wide window well that two people could sit in .  i ordered my donuts .  i went with the indian cinnamon ,  the caramel banana ,  the pina colada ,  and the halva pistachio .  the ladies behind the counter worked as fast as they could given the decent sized collection of people waiting for orders and bopping in .  my order was processed quickly ,  and i got my coffee right after i ordered it .  the coffee was one of the only things that was a disappointment besides the lack of seating .    since there was no room to sit ,  much less stand i took my donuts and coffee out to a park just off of federal between 3rd and 4th st .  the donuts were truly transcendant .   each donut was a symphony of flavors on my tongue .   the indian cinnamon - very light on the cinnamon ,  coated with sugar .  hot ,  fresh ,  and so moist that it pinched in half when i started to eat it .   the caramel banana - a delicious meld of flavors with something added to the banana chips that made them more tasty than i \" d imagined .   the pina colada - the donut i though i ' d enjoy the least .  however it tasted like the rach 3 and beethoven ' s 9th all rolled up .  a complex mix of flavors that together was truly amazing .  and unlike the current generations ,  i don ' t use that term lightly .   the halva and pistachio - the final movement .  more subtle flavors that nevertheless worked well .  i ' d never had halva before ,  but i liked it .   believe the hype .  believe the ny times article .  federal donuts makes some of the best donuts i ' ve had .

    "text": "i frequent the rittenhouse square area often as an old friend runs a bar down the street ,  and have passed porcini ' s many times .  having had a date last saturday ,  i thought it would have been a good opportunity to try it out .   the layout of the restaurant left some to be desired ,  as the host stand is at the back ,  and the place is very small save for the upstairs ,  but they were able to sit us almost immediately in the upstairs dining room which was small ,  yet charming ,  and slightly more roomy .  a gentleman who i am guessing was the co - owner was very friendly and ensured our 8 : 00 reservation was filled and the wine poured .  the service wasn ' t slow ,  though awkward .  it seemed that our server was there when we didn ' t need her ,  yet not there when we did ,  though she had a very friendly demeanor and was not rushing us in the least .  the food was delicious ,  though a few things stood out to me as peculiar ,  hence the 4 stars instead of 5 .  this was a legit italian restaurant ,  yet they had ravioli as an antipasto .  anybody who knows italian knows this means  \" before \"  the pasta ,  not the pasta itself .  secondly ,  the bread ,  which was very good ,  came with butter ,  and not olive oil .  again ,  this was an italian restaurant ,  not an applebee ' s .   for our appetizer we ordered eggplant ,  which was okay .  was sliced a bit too thin ,  though this may have been personal preference ,  but in doing so was masked by the  ( delicious )  red gravy and  ( addictive )  mozzarella ,  which was very fresh ,  so while i may not have been tasting the eggplant ,  i was tasting some very delicious flavors .   our main courses came in due time afterwards ,  enough to let our eggplant digest ,  but not enough time to make us forget .  i ordered the special ,  linguine in a light vodka cream sauce with salmon and capers ,  my date ordered the canneloni .  both were inspired .  not the gigantic portions known to most frequent italian restaurant goers in philadelphia ,  but just enough .  the flavors were subtle ,  yet plentiful .   we did skip dessert in favor of coffee .  i ordered a double espresso ,  my date a cappucino  ( i know ,  but she was cute ,  so it ' s okay )  .  the waittress came out with a regular and double cappucino .  wasn ' t the end of the world ,  so i just enjoyed it ,  and it was good ,  but just speak up if you want an espresso .   overall i recommend this place ,  mainly for the main courses ,  but am willing to go back and give it another shot and give porcini ' s their 5th star .  i hope i can !
