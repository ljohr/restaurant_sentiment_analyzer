    "text": "summary :  terrible value ,  unreasonable wait times ,  extremely inattentive service staff ,  and perhaps worst of all ,  smooth jazz .    when i read some of the reviews on here ,  i feel like i must have gone to a different restaurant than everybody else .  my experience was not a positive one .  let me first say that my friends are now mad at me for bringing them here .  i thought it would be hard to go wrong with a 5 - star reviewed restaurant ,  but i was completely mistaken .   now ,  the few positives :  the jerk chicken was tasty ,  and the johnny cakes moreso .  the staff was courteous .  that ' s it .   the staff .  we got in at 8 ,  and they came for the drink order at 8 : 25 .  we ordered our food at the same time ,  because we didn ' t know when we ' d see them again .  twice in the next half hour ,  they came by twice to confirm our orders .  some mix - up .  we noticed this happening at other tables around us as well .   ( some of )  the food arrived at 9 : 30 .  we waited for more than an hour for our meals !  and two of our side orders were forgotten .  was the restaurant unusually busy ?  only 60 %  of the tables were occupied .  the other problem with the servers is that ,  like the menu ,  they didn ' t make clear what came with the meals .  if somebody is ordering something that already comes with the meal ,  the staff would think to tell them ,  right ?  no .  and if you order a beverage ,  expect it to be about 80 %  ice .  my friends finished theirs in a few sips .  so we had to ask for more beverages ,  and the staff did not bring any .  finally one friend had to go to their car to get some water .  a good 20 minutes later i was able to flag them down ,  and we finally got more to drink .  everyone was cordial ,  but ignored us for most of the night .  the word amateurish comes to mind .   the ambience ?  well ,  the dining room is nicely decorated ,  but too cramped .  the gentleman at the table behind me kept ramming into my chair .  there was just no room .  it also would have been nice if they weren ' t showing the walking dead on the big screen tv in front of me .  i don ' t really want to see stabbings and blood spurting while i ' m eating .  the biggest problem with the setting ,  though ,  was the music .  a never - ending procession of smooth jazz played at an uncomfortably high volume .  i want to know ,  who actually enjoys that music ?  my friend said it felt like being trapped in a dentist ' s waiting room .   the food .  my friend who ordered beef patties said that they were lousy .  and we all agreed that the rice and peas were completely flavorless .  it came in a  ' bowl '  the size of a tea cup .  as i mentioned ,  the jerk chicken was tasty ,  but the portion laughably small .  the large portion meal at yah mon is significantly smaller than the regular portion at jerk hut .  i understand that it ' s organic ,  but when you order the large portion ,  you shouldn ' t go home hungry .  and that ' s exactly what i did .    the only reason i ' m not giving 1 star is because some of the minuscule portions of food were tasty .   obviously ,  none of us are going back ,  and i couldn ' t recommend yah mon to anyone with whom i wanted to stay friends .

    "text": "i tried las cazuelas recently ,  after hearing pretty good things about the food and atmosphere .   the first day i went in the place was crowded but we were seated promptly and our order was taken right away .   the food came out fast for how many people were there .   however ,  it lacked any real flavor .   camarone tacos for me and a seitan dish for my friend .   the seitan was way too salty with no other flavour and the tacos were very bland .   still hungry ,  we got the ceviche .   this was the only good thing about our meal .   water glasses weren ' t filled at all during the meal ,  even after the restaurant emptied .   i decided to go back a few days later ,  to give it another chance .   we had a different server this time ,  who seemed very new to the business .   tables who sat after us had their order taken before .   however ,  again ,  the food came out fast .    ( wrong order first ,  but quickly fixed .  )   this time i got the veggie enchiladas and my friend got the camarone dish .   again ,  very disappointed .   salt and pepper seem to be their only seasonings .   the shrimp had no flavour ,  they were very much overcooked .   the sauce on the enchiladas was the same salsa put out on the tables as you are seated .   the veggies on the side of the shrimp meal were the exact same as the ones in the enchiladas .   there is no creativity or thought behind any of these meals .   i will not be going back .   i have had much better mexican off of the trucks in south philly .

    "text": "ok here ' s the deal  -  i really wanted to like this place ,  especially with all of the great reviews .   it ' s not close to me but i made the trip because it is supposedly great !   sadly it was underwhelming from the minute we walked in the door .   there were only a few customers ,  and the two waitresses were watching tv and barely acknowledged us .   one of them approached but didn ' t say anything ,  she just grabbed some menus and took us to a table .   she didn ' t ask for drink orders or anything ,  just brought us some waters without saying a word .     we selected several items from the sushi menu and waited for her to return .   and waited some more .   and some more .   finally after about 10 minutes i got her attention and she came back and took my order sheet ,  again without saying a word .   the miso soup came out pretty quickly but it just wasn ' t great .   when the sushi arrived ,  i noticed it was only about half of our order .   i wasn ' t too worried about it though ,  because there was only one sushi chef behind the bar and it ' s not uncommon for places to bring out parts of your order over time .   still ,  the service was just plain bad and i won ' t be back !

    "text": "living in woodstown ,  the only local grocery store is acme ,  so if you ' re in a hurry and don ' t have time to drive up to mullica hills shoprite ,  the acme is your only choice .  it ' s overly priced and doesn ' t have the best selection and employees are either rude or don ' t care .   their pharmacy on the other hand is the total opposite ,  don and brooke and their staff are the most caring people ever and are always on top of everything and will do whatever they can to help anyone who comes up to them .  recently though the store made a bunch of changes .  i usually stop on my way home from work late weekday afternoons .  you can always bet there ' s no baskets by the doors and need to go hunt one down in one of the checkout lanes .  shopping carts are always in the parking lot running around crashing into cars on windy days with a mind of their own .   during the summer months the tomatoes in the produce area are a fruit fly breeding ground .  they replaced their four self checkout lanes with four staffed express lanes ,  but they only open one lane during the weekday afternoon peak hours ,  making the wait four times longer than before .  if there was another place to get groceries between the delaware memorial bridge and woodstown i would surely shop there because anything else would be better than this acme ,  but there isn ' t any other choice .

    "text": "so i ' ve returned to muriels on a few trips with groups since my prior review ,  and it was fine ,  so no need to change for the better or worse .  .  . most recent visit ,  i ' m strongly tempted to leave 1 star as it was so frustrating ,  but given i haven ' t written any since 2010 for more positive  ( but not exceptional )  visits ,  it seems more fair to leave another 2 star one .   made the mistake of coming in for a drink on the balcony on what happened to be saint patricks day  -  albeit it was fairly vacant .   first time i ' ve gone to the bar to get a drink and there was no one else waiting ,  just 2 people sitting at the bar ,  already served .   the bartender upon our arrival says she ' ll be right back  -  given we were ordering a sauv blanc and an iced tea ,  could have easily given our order prior to her departure .   she then left for over 10 minutes  ( during which time a manager or some other employee came behind the bar but made no acknowledgement of us ,  or attempted to take our order )  .  .  . and then upon return ,  did not apologize ,  but asked if we ' ve decided what we want .  .  . well ,  i decided prior to you leaving ,  and i sure as hell hope within 10 minutes i ' d have decided on one drink !   she then took the other people who had accumulated ' s orders prior to serving our solitary glass of wine and one iced tea .  .  . and she asked if it was for here or to go ,  after taking out the glass .  i said  \" for the balcony ,  \"   ( aka not to go )  ,  and she switched it out with a plastic cup .  given  $ 9 . 50 for a house sauv is greater than nyc and london pricing  ( and the cocktails are actually less in most cases )  ,  i would say that it could warrant an actual glass ,  to remain on venue  -  which we mentioned .  . and she stated that they were short of glasses given it ' s  \" saint pattys \"  .  .  . well ,  i ' m sure you have a dishwashing machine .  regardless ,  she at no point said thank you ,  and was quite rude throughout ,  enough so that i truly regret my frequent visits ,  and one of us complained  ( about the cup ,  not the delay and rudeness )  to management  ( however ,  had i complained ,  the rudeness would have been my primary issue ,  not the cup )  .   to note ,  the balcony was 100 %  empty  -  for the first time i ' ve ever seen ,  so no ,  they were not busy ,  also evidenced by the lack of patrons at the bar .   even at the point we left ,  there were only 2 more couples ,  whose orders she took prior to serving us ,  so not exactly a complete rush for which she would be stressed .  .  . nor did she go tot the restroom ,  so not sure where she went for 10 +  minutes .     having been a server ,  and having brought many ,  many groups here over the years ,  and visiting multiple times every visit to nola ,  i found this pretty disappointing .     that said ,  i ' ll still return ,  if only for a drink on the balcony ,  and hope there is a different bartender .

    "text": "i stop here frequently since it is right off the hwy on my way home from work .  this is the best of the schnucks in the city itself ,  although i have to admit that the bar is pretty low right there .  the staff is pleasant compared to the staff at any other city schnucks ,  which again is not really that hard to accomplish .   the selection of merchandise could be much better ,  for instance good luck finding any of the store brand soda in diet ,  apparently the locals don ' t care if they are 300 +  lbs ,  as the managers tell me there is no demand for it .  the deli is borderline awful and they do a spectacular job of having all of the gristle and fat hidden in the pre - sliced lunchmeat ,  you figure that out when you get home and you have enough real meat to make a half a sandwich and enough byproduct to feed your cat for several days .  also be sure to check the expiration date on dairy before you buy as i have gotten milk and yogurt home several times to find it days or weeks out of date .   the weirdest part about this place is the cast of derelicts that loiter there daily yet are not escorted off the premises .  to the contrary ,  they seem welcomed ,  one even wears a schnucks jacket in the colder months as he panhandles ,  sifts half smoked cigarette butts out of the butt disposal out front and shuffles about the store looking creepy .  perhaps characters like this are considered quaint by the locals ,  but they illustrate why i left for south county back in the day .

    "text": "the good :  great food for a decent price .   we got the  $ 65 oyster platter which came with 12 huge and succulent oysters ,  about a dozen each of clams and mussels ,  10 - 12 tails of jumbo shrimp ,  about half of a huge king crab ,  2 small sauce cups of ceviche ,  and 3 different sauces including a malt vinegar ,  cocktail sauce ,  and a spicy mayonnaise dipping sauce ,  as well as multiple wedges of lemon .   the platter was huge and probably could have fed 3 - 4 people ,  though i was able to eat most of it with some help from the fiancee .   the oysters were fresh and delicious and were the star of the platter ,  while the crab was the not seasoned and somewhat bland compared to the rest of the platter .   of note ,  i liked the shrimp as they were steamed with a spicy cajun seasoning which was a nice louisiana touch .   we also ordered the fried oyster ,  bacon ,  romaine lettuce ,  and avocado salad which was decent .   the fried oysters on the salad were perfectly prepared ,  though the bacon was thick cut and a bit on the tough / chewy side  ( i prefer bacon in a salad to be crispy )  .   the bad :  service was horrible .   i think we got the worst server in the restaurant ;  here ' s the breakdown :  his appearance -  - his long hair made me think he should have been in an 80 ' s hair metal band instead of serving in a moderately upscale seafood restaurant .   his service -  - inattentive :  1 .  he never introduced himself before taking our order ,  2 .  he didn ' t allow us to finish our order as after we ordered our oyster platter he took our menus and walked away and i had to get another waiter / server to order a salad that we wanted to come with our oyster platter ,  3 .   he forgot our bread ,  and we didn ' t realize we were supposed to get bread until halfway through our meal when we saw other tables getting bread ,  4 .  we asked him for lemon with our water and he forgot after multiple queries ,  and we actually asked 3 different waiter / waitresses / servers for lemon and they all forgot ,  though our main waiter eventually remembered and brought the lemon to us in the middle of our meal .   the final straw in this terrible haystack was his apathy and rude demeanor at the end of our meal -  - after taking my credit card and charging for the meal ,  he walked by our table and threw the credit card / receipt pad so that it plopped on our table and said  \" here you go \"  and continued walking away like he didn ' t care .   overall ,  it seemed like he did not really care for his job and was there just going through the motions .   i was surprised that a restaurant of luke ' s stature hired a waiter like this ,  as with an appropriate waiter and appropriate service ,  this meal would have been phenomenal .   unfortuntely ,  the service left us in a sour mood despite the quality of the food .   if the service would have matched the food ,  luke would have deserved a 4 or 5 stars in my mind ,  but because of the poor service we received ,  i gave the restaurant 2 / 5 stars .

    "text": "the only reason i am giving this place 2 stars is because of the hostess !   now ,  i go to a lot of restaurants .  the hostess  ( petite black girl )  is extremely rude with an attitude .  as soon as we walked through the doors ,  she looked at us and said the wait would be 30mins  ( which wasn ' t the case because she sat another couple down 5 min after us )  .  someone needs to fire her !  she brought our menus over and just put them on the table ,  rolled her eyes and walked away .  no smile ,  nothing .  what a horrible start of our meal .  then the same thing happened to the couple who sat next to us where the couple said thank you for bringing the menus and she walked away without saying anything or smiling !    the bartenders and waiters are attentive and nice .   the burger here is wonderful !  it ' s big ,  juicy and full of flavor .  5 stars for a delicious burger !

'  '  as i looked behind him to mounds of extra paper containers .  wow ,  way to loose a customer buddy .    now on to relish :   $ 8 for chicken in waffles ,  yes people pieces of chicken were chopped up and  infused in the mini waffles ,  add a pat of maple syrup butter on top ,  yum yum .  sounds amazing right ?  ?  ?  yeah that ' s what i was thinking until i bit in to the waffle and my pallet was met by the disgusting taste of dark meat chicken .  my entire body quivered as i spit the waffle in to a napkin !   come on relish ,  you should disclose this as not everyone has the stomach for dark meat .  .  . in the trash it went .   i will not be returning to this night market !  i saw the reviews but i really tried to give this one the benefit of the doubt .  we were so disappointed we ended up driving to jim ' s steaks in west philly to satisfy our food cravings .  i will give the one in chinatown a try in the fall .  my suggestions to my foodies ,  avoid this one .  .  .

    "text": "i decided to give this place a try though my go to pizza place is angelos on larchmont .  well ,  the delivery was prompt and everything was hot thus the two stars .  i ordered the chicken cutlet sandwich on a seeded roll but asked for saut\u00e9ed spinach instead of broccoli rabe ,  which they gave me .  unfortunately ,  the saut\u00e9ed spinach had no taste and i didn ' t taste any sharp provolone cheese either  ( you would have surely tasted it )  .  i had to add garlic powder ,  red pepper flakes and grated parm cheese so it had some taste .  the seeded roll was the winner .  as a result of the good reviews of the rice balls i decided to order them .  gross  -  right in the trash .  to all of the new yorkers who ate here and said it was as good as new york italian food doesn ' t know good food from mediocre food .  back to angelos .  best food around !

    "text": "i had reservations for two at 6 : 30 and i was seated right away within two minutes .  the atmosphere of this place was nice but that ' s where most the good stops .    i honestly don ' t understand how this restaurant got such high reviews .  either people had low expectations or they entered here drunk from an adventure at bourbon st or frenchmen .   i ordered a river bend and it was made absolutely horrible .  it tasted like medicine or as if the vodka was randomly thrown in grape juice and ass .    i ordered a charcuterie board ,  little neck clams ,  oysters ,  brussel sprouts ,  and the shrimp grits .  the charcuterie board and brussel sprouts were amazing .  the brussel sprouts had a seared and sweet vinaigrette flavor .  even though i really prefer the charcuterie sampler at cochon butcher over the charcuterie here it was still good .  it came with a rabbit pate which was wonderful .   as we waited for our clams to come out ,  the server came to notify us that they were out of clams  ( thirty minutes later btw )  .  so we ordered a half dozen oysters instead .  those came out within five minutes .  however instead of getting a half dozen oysters ,  we ended up receiving only five oysters on our plate .  wtf ?  !  ?  !  we notified our server and he ended up bringing us two additional oysters which was nice ,  but seriously ?  !  how does a restaurant like this hire people that don ' t know the basics of counting ?  that right there made me question the quality of the restaurant and how overhyped this was due to john besh .  the oysters were shucked wonderfully but that ' s really all i can give them credit for .   anyways ,  we finished all of our appetizers and waited an incredibly long time for the shrimp and grits .  after waiting too long ,  we canceled our order with another waitress and our server finally came out to tell us that our order was ready but he wanted to wait for us to finish our appetizers to bring out the plate .  i don ' t know of any restaurant that would make you wait an hour for your entree but sure .  .  .  when the shrimp and grits came out i was honestly disappointed .    i ' m sorry to say but this restaurant may be nice but it absolutely does not deserve to be a four star restaurant .  if you want good prices ,  good taste ,  and service i would go to royal house instead .  otherwise ya no .  .  .  .  .  i would never go back here again nor recommend this place to someone else .  .  .  i am so sad that this place was such a disappointment .  thanks john besh .  left the place hungry .   :  ( ",

( funny enough ,  she was picking me up after my trip to miami ,  so cuban food was already on my mind .  )   the fricase de pollo  ( chicken fricassee )  was just okay .  it wasn ' t particularly flavorful ,  and the bed of rice it came on was soggy .    we also ordered a beef pastelito ,  but got chicken .  and while that ' s obviously not a terrible mistake ,  the pastelito itself was pretty bad .  much too sweet ,  and not in a good way .  it was a little like those cheap danishes that someone brought to your office a few days ago ,  and that have just been sitting around since then .    the cafecito that came with our meal was a nice touch ,  but ultimately ,  this also left us pining for miami .  the foamy top was exceptional ,  and it was beautifully presented in a shot glass that allowed us to watch the foam settle out .  but it just didn ' t have the richness that we were expecting .    it should also be said that the place was cute and the prices were reasonable .  we particularly liked the crocodile - themed wall painting over the front door .    underwhelming on a number of levels ,  and nowhere equal to the hype .    the cuban place on moller and 38th is far superior .

(  you get a  #  and take a sign to display at your table .   )  well 2 / 3 of the people got their food within 10 - 15 min .  one chicken bbq sandwich plate and one pork .  i was told that the amount of chicken in the sandwich was disappointing despite the yummy sauce .   the pork sandwich was on the dry side but ok .  my nachos arrived around 40 minutes later only after reminding one of the runners twice i never received my food .   the nachos were okay .  the pork bbq was kinda dry but the sauces available were good .   i plan to try this place again soon but so far i am less than impressed .  parking can be an issue also of note .
