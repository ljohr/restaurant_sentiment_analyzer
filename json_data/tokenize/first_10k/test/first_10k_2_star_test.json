    "text": "a group of six went to the block a little over five years ago and none of us enjoyed our meal .  the amount of salt ruined everything .  we knew we wouldn ' t be going back .  over the years ,  i was told by a number of people how much they liked this place .  my husband and i decided to try it again .  we thought maybe we had been there on a bad night or perhaps there was a new chef .  four of us went this past sunday .  the ale and smoked cheddar was good  -  a good melted cheese with house made pretzels .  i found the house - made bacon jam to be too salty ,  but the other three liked it .  our server said the pork chop ,  the pork and dumplings ,  and the white wine braised pork were the three most popular entrees .  i ,  fortunately ,  ordered the burger .  the burger was nothing special ,  but it was fine .  i couldn ' t eat the fries due to the amount of salt on them .  my fingers were literally covered in salt after picking up a few fries .  one person ordered the white wine braised pork and said it was a little too salty and just didn ' t taste good .  she did like the potatoes and carrots that came with the pork .  the other two ordered the pork and dumplings .  one ate about a quarter of it and the other a little less than half .  it was so salty they couldn ' t eat any more a person ,  who i believe may have been a manager ,  came by to see how everything was and we told her .  she said most of the spices they use contain salt .  she then offered to have different entrees made which we declined  -  we ' d already been there for a little while .  they did take one of the orders of pork and dumplings off the bill .  since there wasn ' t a lot of dinner consumed ,  we did order some ice cream which was just okay .  and the salted caramel was ,  you guessed it ,  too salty !  i honestly don ' t know how people can eat the food here .  it ' s truly the saltiest food i ' ve ever had .  that much salt can ' t be good for anybody !  we definitely won ' t be going back .

    "text": "so i ' ve returned to muriels on a few trips with groups since my prior review ,  and it was fine ,  so no need to change for the better or worse .  .  . most recent visit ,  i ' m strongly tempted to leave 1 star as it was so frustrating ,  but given i haven ' t written any since 2010 for more positive  ( but not exceptional )  visits ,  it seems more fair to leave another 2 star one .   made the mistake of coming in for a drink on the balcony on what happened to be saint patricks day  -  albeit it was fairly vacant .   first time i ' ve gone to the bar to get a drink and there was no one else waiting ,  just 2 people sitting at the bar ,  already served .   the bartender upon our arrival says she ' ll be right back  -  given we were ordering a sauv blanc and an iced tea ,  could have easily given our order prior to her departure .   she then left for over 10 minutes  ( during which time a manager or some other employee came behind the bar but made no acknowledgement of us ,  or attempted to take our order )  .  .  . and then upon return ,  did not apologize ,  but asked if we ' ve decided what we want .  .  . well ,  i decided prior to you leaving ,  and i sure as hell hope within 10 minutes i ' d have decided on one drink !   she then took the other people who had accumulated ' s orders prior to serving our solitary glass of wine and one iced tea .  .  . and she asked if it was for here or to go ,  after taking out the glass .  i said  \" for the balcony ,  \"   ( aka not to go )  ,  and she switched it out with a plastic cup .  given  $ 9 . 50 for a house sauv is greater than nyc and london pricing  ( and the cocktails are actually less in most cases )  ,  i would say that it could warrant an actual glass ,  to remain on venue  -  which we mentioned .  . and she stated that they were short of glasses given it ' s  \" saint pattys \"  .  .  . well ,  i ' m sure you have a dishwashing machine .  regardless ,  she at no point said thank you ,  and was quite rude throughout ,  enough so that i truly regret my frequent visits ,  and one of us complained  ( about the cup ,  not the delay and rudeness )  to management  ( however ,  had i complained ,  the rudeness would have been my primary issue ,  not the cup )  .   to note ,  the balcony was 100 %  empty  -  for the first time i ' ve ever seen ,  so no ,  they were not busy ,  also evidenced by the lack of patrons at the bar .   even at the point we left ,  there were only 2 more couples ,  whose orders she took prior to serving us ,  so not exactly a complete rush for which she would be stressed .  .  . nor did she go tot the restroom ,  so not sure where she went for 10 +  minutes .     having been a server ,  and having brought many ,  many groups here over the years ,  and visiting multiple times every visit to nola ,  i found this pretty disappointing .     that said ,  i ' ll still return ,  if only for a drink on the balcony ,  and hope there is a different bartender .

    "text": "it pains me to write this review since the previous dozen or so times i ' my boyfriend and i have been to tzin for date nights ,  it was always enjoyable ,  cozy and the servers really made us feel special ,  however ,  this past weekend ,  my boyfriend and i had our least favourite dining experience there and that really made us both question if we want to return in the near future .    it ' s true when they say customer service either makes or breaks an experience .  when we first started going to tzin about two years ago ,  we were blessed with two excellent servers  -  kerrie  &  mel .  .  .  they alone made us want to come back because they made us laugh and were so enthusiastic about the experience and the food .  however ,  about a year ago ,  mel left to pursue other endeavours ,  but we were left in the capable hands of kerrie  ( who is also the owner )  .  she has always been friendly ,  sweet and super pleasant .  re - hired was a former male server from the past .  the last few times we ' ve dined there we luckily had kerrie has our server so my boyfriend and i were happy about that .  however ,  this past saturday ,  upon arrival ,  we were surprised to see that kerrie was not there ,  and instead ,  there was the regular male server from previous times plus another gentleman serving the room .  we were greeted promptly and asked if we had reservations  ( which we did )  .  there were two free tables ,  for two ,  at the time  -  one right near the entrance ,  and the other in the middle of the room .  he immediately pointed to the table right near the entrance for us to sit .  we obviously preferred to sit closer inside since it was  - 30 outside and there isn ' t much of a barrier between the outside door and inside .  i therefore had to ask if we could sit at the other table instead .  instead of agreeing to it ,  we had to wait until the server asked the other gentleman for permission  ( which i thought weird since they were both tables for 2 )  .  anyways ,  that ' s fine .  we got our table in the middle and were seated promptly but missing a menu until my boyfriend had to ask for me .  it ' s around this point that i really started feeling like this date night wasn ' t going to be the same as others and my boyfriend said he was just thinking the same thing .  the server wasn ' t warm and genuine in his greeting ,  didn ' t even ask how we were doing ,  just wanted to see if we were ready to make our order .  throughout the night ,  i noticed the same lack of personal attentiveness  -  for instance ,  in the past with the girls ,  usually when the dish is placed on the table ,  it is described in delicious detail  -  this time nothing was described except for the three different sauces accompanying the chorizo .  also ,  our server never once checked up on us after the first few bites ,  to see how our food was .  incidentally ,  we ordered three of our favourite dishes and they are all usually very good ,  but this time round ,  the potato bravas was seriously lacking in depth  -  a certain smokiness that we ' ve tasted in the past was not there and all the flavours felt disconjointed like they didn ' t have time to meld together .  the bacon and the chorizo we ordered were very good .  all - in - all ,  my boyfriend and i commented on how cold and inpersonal it felt ,  even though the space is small and warm .  we actually finished our food and drink ,  didn ' t linger to have dessert like usual ,  because that ' s how disappointed we were with the night ' s experience .  in fact ,  our date lasted a grand total of 1 hour from start to finish .  so much for a lovely evening out .   please note ,  the price for food here is a steep ,  albeit good ,  compared to the portion sizes .  for instance ,  we ordered the  \" potato bravas \"  which was  $ 14 . 50 for literally two small handfuls of chopped potatoes with bits of bacon ,  covered in a tomato sauce and topped with green onion .  the  \" bacon \"  dish  was  $ 16 for 3 bite - size pieces of pork belly on crostini .  and the  \" grilled chorizo sausage \"  was  $ 15 for maybe a 20 cm long piece of sausage .

    "text": "i tried las cazuelas recently ,  after hearing pretty good things about the food and atmosphere .   the first day i went in the place was crowded but we were seated promptly and our order was taken right away .   the food came out fast for how many people were there .   however ,  it lacked any real flavor .   camarone tacos for me and a seitan dish for my friend .   the seitan was way too salty with no other flavour and the tacos were very bland .   still hungry ,  we got the ceviche .   this was the only good thing about our meal .   water glasses weren ' t filled at all during the meal ,  even after the restaurant emptied .   i decided to go back a few days later ,  to give it another chance .   we had a different server this time ,  who seemed very new to the business .   tables who sat after us had their order taken before .   however ,  again ,  the food came out fast .    ( wrong order first ,  but quickly fixed .  )   this time i got the veggie enchiladas and my friend got the camarone dish .   again ,  very disappointed .   salt and pepper seem to be their only seasonings .   the shrimp had no flavour ,  they were very much overcooked .   the sauce on the enchiladas was the same salsa put out on the tables as you are seated .   the veggies on the side of the shrimp meal were the exact same as the ones in the enchiladas .   there is no creativity or thought behind any of these meals .   i will not be going back .   i have had much better mexican off of the trucks in south philly .

    "text": "barone ' s has all the right ingredients for the possibility of a successful office party .   the restaurant is divided into several separate spaces ,  so we were able to get crazy with our annual re - gifting game without annoying the rest of the diners .   the pasta dishes were delicious .   they accommodated requests for gift and wine tables to be set up before we arrived .   unfortunately ,  there were far more cons than pros .   barone ' s seriously lacks organization and professionalism for large group planning .   when i called to ask about pricing packages ,  i was told that tax would be waived if we paid in cash .   this meant that the total cost per person fell within my budget goal ,  and so i went ahead and made a reservation .   a couple weeks later ,  when i stopped in to choose the menu ,  i was told that the person i spoke with on the phone was misinformed ,  and that we would be charged 5 %  tax rather than 7 %  .   since this would raise the cost per person by a dollar ,  and i was not going to go around asking everyone who had already rsvp ' d to give me another dollar ,  i had to go back the next day to speak with a manager .   i explained my concerns to the manager ,  hoping that he ' d lower the cost of the dinner so that the 5 %  increase in price wouldn ' t change my total cost per person .   my main concern was that since my total cost included a tip ,  the restaurant would take what they were owed ,  but the servers wouldn ' t receive their 20 %  cut .   the manager assured me that it would not be an issue because he would be the server the evening of our event ,  and since he understood the situation ,  he just wouldn ' t take tip .    \" seriously ,  don ' t worry about it ,  \"  i was assured .   so the night of the party came ,  and there were several red flags from the start .   first ,  the manager was nowhere to be seen .   it would have been nice to be greeted by someone who was familiar with all of my requests upon arrival ,  perhaps a review of the menu that had been chosen .   but when i got there ,  the hostess simply pointed me in the direction of the back room and i was on my own .   said room happened to be freezing .   i mentioned it to a worker ,  and was told that the heat was just turned on for that room .   the room never warmed to a comfortable temperature ,  and i actually had a few diners who ate their entire dinners with their winter coats on .   the bathroom that was at the back of our room was gross .   it looked like someone had given himself a haircut in there before we arrived ,  little snips of hair all over the sink ,  and a canister of hair pomade on the counter .   a friend had to wipe up the sink before the rest of the party arrived .   there were also no paper towels and the room was running low on toilet paper .   it took several requests before these changes were made .   the service itself was good .   from what i experienced at my own table ,  drinks and food arrived in a timely manner ,  and the servers were friendly .   aside from the pasta course ,  no one really seemed impressed by their food .   portions were huge ,  but taste was forgettable .   the manager finally showed up about halfway through our dinner to ask how we wanted our dessert served ,  cut up all the cakes for us ,  and then disappeared again .   more issues ,  or maybe the same issue ,  arrived when it was time to pay .   we were charged for an extra diner ;  i mistakenly said that we had 31 ,  and that is how many the manager put on our bill ,  despite the fact that i know he must have counted how many plates went out so that he ' d be able to tally up our dues later on .   he had to know i had miscounted .   oh ,  and hey ,  remember when i was told that gratuity would not be included and that the manager would be our server so we shouldn ' t worry about an inadequate tip ?   yeah ,  well gratuity was included ,  and we had not collected enough money to meet the total .   i had to ask the poor server  ( who was not the manager )  to remove the gratuity from the check so that we could afford the bill ,  and then i ended up throwing in some extra cash that i  ( luckily ,  and uncharacteristically )  had in my wallet to come closer to what the total should have been with a 20 %  tip .    * major guilt *   the manager made an appearance again as we were on our way out ,  and we pointed to a large bottle of wine that had been opened but not otherwise touched ,  offering it to him and his servers .    \" ugh ,  i don ' t drink wine .   that stuff is like grape juice ,  \"  he scoffed ,  as his cell phone rang with some trancey club beats .   sorry playa .   i ' ll leave you to your red bull and vodka and fist pump my way out the door .   and my coworkers and i will not be back for next year ' s winter soiree .

( funny enough ,  she was picking me up after my trip to miami ,  so cuban food was already on my mind .  )   the fricase de pollo  ( chicken fricassee )  was just okay .  it wasn ' t particularly flavorful ,  and the bed of rice it came on was soggy .    we also ordered a beef pastelito ,  but got chicken .  and while that ' s obviously not a terrible mistake ,  the pastelito itself was pretty bad .  much too sweet ,  and not in a good way .  it was a little like those cheap danishes that someone brought to your office a few days ago ,  and that have just been sitting around since then .    the cafecito that came with our meal was a nice touch ,  but ultimately ,  this also left us pining for miami .  the foamy top was exceptional ,  and it was beautifully presented in a shot glass that allowed us to watch the foam settle out .  but it just didn ' t have the richness that we were expecting .    it should also be said that the place was cute and the prices were reasonable .  we particularly liked the crocodile - themed wall painting over the front door .    underwhelming on a number of levels ,  and nowhere equal to the hype .    the cuban place on moller and 38th is far superior .

    "text": "let me start this off by saying that i ' ve been here in the past and had a very pleasant experience .  not this time ,  though ,  and i ' ll come to why shortly .   first of all ,  it was probably slightly busier than normal due to the winter classic .   okay ,  i get that .  but this entire visit was completely fumbled by the staff here ,  and i was ready to leave almost as soon as we sat down .   no one came by to take our drink order .  we sat in the direct path of every server in the place  ( the kitchen entrance was literally one table behind us ,  so they constantly whizzed by us as breakneck speed )  ,  yet waited over 10 minutes just for a coke and a beer sampler .    for the appetizer ,  we ordered the pale ale beer bread ,  which came with a blue cheese cream cheese and bacon jam .  yum .  my only complaint is that the bread was totally soaked in grease .  the cream cheese kinda slid off ,  but whatever .  i made it work .    the beer sampler was great ,  too .  we tried a variety of stouts ,  ales and ciders .  my wife loved the double bean ale ,  and their coffee stout is always on point .  for 5 small beers for  $ 10 ,  that ' s pretty much a steal .   the food ,  though .  .  .   i ordered the pulled pork sandwich with potato wedges .  notice that i said wedges ,  as in plural ?  well ,  i got five .  five wedges .  and one was so big ,  i held it in my hand and pretended to be on buffy the vampire slayer .   the sandwich was so cold ,  i didn ' t even eat it ,  and the fries were hotter than the surface of the sun .  i took the sandwich home ,  hoping to heat it up later .   my wife got the apple and bacon pizza ,  if you could call it that .  she asked for blue cheese on the side ,  not knowing that it wouldn ' t come with cheese otherwise .  you know ,  like a normal pizza .  and it didn ' t have some apple ,  it had ,  like ,  a whole apple .  like giant slices over a measly amount of bacon .  it was sad ,  and it made me sad .    i got my coke refilled once and that ' s only because mary pulled a staff member aside to ask her for it .  i felt bad because it wasn ' t her table ,  but our server was nowhere to be seen .    my hopes were high ,  but schlaflys dashed them .  i was planning on taking a dessert home ,  too ,  which makes me angriest of all !

    "text": "a group of yelpers and i were all appalled at the level of service we received at this establishment .  from the start this hovel of mediocrity fell on its face by not seating us at all ;  the hostess was not even at the door .  we seated ourselves .  once we were in ,  the bar - tending waitress ,  who seemed to be running the show upstairs ,  took our drink orders ,  all the while giving off the aura of disdain and employment - regret that could sear hair off .   we had to wait around for over 30 min for someone to take our actual orders and after i took it upon myself to express to the waitress that were getting antsy .  the forceful ok and stare i got back did tick me off but i decided i wouldn ' t make a huge deal of it .  i gave her a well - timed  \" alright ,  [pause] thank you \"  until she broke eye contact and went back to our table .  not a pleasant experience .  even after all of this ,  someone was sent to  \" confirm \"  our orders 10 min later .   when we finally received the food it didn ' t impress me terribly .  the fish and chips plate was plentiful but the fish itself was somewhat greasy and bland .  however ,  the humus platter was huge and pretty darn tasty  ( but nothing that can ' t be found elsewhere )  .  decent prices though .   the dcor of this place was as mediocre as was everything else about it .  wooden booths and low lighting define this place ,  as well as ever other pub everywhere else ;  the only distinction being the occasional framed picture of a sheep .    ( i must admit i did not get to see much of the lower floor and dined upstairs )   the upstairs had large windows that may open to take in some night air  -  but they were closed when we were there .   my advice ,  if you ' re in the neighborhood go to monk ' s just around the corner .  price point may differ but hell ,  so does quality !

    "text": "hubby and i ate here before years ago and was really impressed by the large portions and good food .  unfortunately we recently visited because of our prior visit and it wasn ' t the same .  first off the bloody mary my husband ordered was watered down and not flavorful .  you tasted the ice and tobassco more than anything .  the clam chowder was great that was only saving grace .  the lobster roll was nit what we expected becuae it was mostly filler than lobster not the big chunks of lobster and buttered roll you ' d expect especially for  $ 18 .  my meal was consisted of fried oysters ,  shrimp ,  calamari and scallops but it was super scarce and not bountiful as before where i had leftovers .  we definitely should have ordered a whole lobster or crab special to share than what we ordered .  it ' s always full and people love the view as we did but this time we were sorely disappointed",

    "text": "thouroughly disappointed by this one ;  i litterally starved myself up until 6pm to save every bit of room in my stomach for this night .  .  .  i stopped at 5 different food trucks only to be met by sup par food and astronomical prices .    my stops included samosa deb :   $ 10 for curry chicken with rice and samosa  -  horrible !  rice was overcooked to the point it was unrecognizable .  it was mush .  there was no curry .  it taste more like a bland indian dish which i have never had .  the spices were there but there was no salt .  the dosa was mushy .  it was disgusting !    next stop k - town korean fried chicken :   $ 8 for 4 chicken wings supposedly cooked korean style .  save your time and your money and go straight to cafe soho !  the wings were breaded and there was more breading than chicken .  what a let down .    then on to the cow and the curd :   $ 14 for glorifried cheese and a frozen lemonade .  it was a fancier version of a mozzarella stick .  sadly enough this is what i enjoyed the most .  what left the bitter tast in my mouth from the visit to this truck ?  i was with friends from atlanta who came to philly for the night market so i wanted to share .  i asked the owner for an extra dish to split the curds and his reply  \" no ,  we have no extra dishes .  try using a napkin .  '  '  as i looked behind him to mounds of extra paper containers .  wow ,  way to loose a customer buddy .    now on to relish :   $ 8 for chicken in waffles ,  yes people pieces of chicken were chopped up and  infused in the mini waffles ,  add a pat of maple syrup butter on top ,  yum yum .  sounds amazing right ?  ?  ?  yeah that ' s what i was thinking until i bit in to the waffle and my pallet was met by the disgusting taste of dark meat chicken .  my entire body quivered as i spit the waffle in to a napkin !   come on relish ,  you should disclose this as not everyone has the stomach for dark meat .  .  . in the trash it went .   i will not be returning to this night market !  i saw the reviews but i really tried to give this one the benefit of the doubt .  we were so disappointed we ended up driving to jim ' s steaks in west philly to satisfy our food cravings .  i will give the one in chinatown a try in the fall .  my suggestions to my foodies ,  avoid this one .  .  .

    "text": "summary :  terrible value ,  unreasonable wait times ,  extremely inattentive service staff ,  and perhaps worst of all ,  smooth jazz .    when i read some of the reviews on here ,  i feel like i must have gone to a different restaurant than everybody else .  my experience was not a positive one .  let me first say that my friends are now mad at me for bringing them here .  i thought it would be hard to go wrong with a 5 - star reviewed restaurant ,  but i was completely mistaken .   now ,  the few positives :  the jerk chicken was tasty ,  and the johnny cakes moreso .  the staff was courteous .  that ' s it .   the staff .  we got in at 8 ,  and they came for the drink order at 8 : 25 .  we ordered our food at the same time ,  because we didn ' t know when we ' d see them again .  twice in the next half hour ,  they came by twice to confirm our orders .  some mix - up .  we noticed this happening at other tables around us as well .   ( some of )  the food arrived at 9 : 30 .  we waited for more than an hour for our meals !  and two of our side orders were forgotten .  was the restaurant unusually busy ?  only 60 %  of the tables were occupied .  the other problem with the servers is that ,  like the menu ,  they didn ' t make clear what came with the meals .  if somebody is ordering something that already comes with the meal ,  the staff would think to tell them ,  right ?  no .  and if you order a beverage ,  expect it to be about 80 %  ice .  my friends finished theirs in a few sips .  so we had to ask for more beverages ,  and the staff did not bring any .  finally one friend had to go to their car to get some water .  a good 20 minutes later i was able to flag them down ,  and we finally got more to drink .  everyone was cordial ,  but ignored us for most of the night .  the word amateurish comes to mind .   the ambience ?  well ,  the dining room is nicely decorated ,  but too cramped .  the gentleman at the table behind me kept ramming into my chair .  there was just no room .  it also would have been nice if they weren ' t showing the walking dead on the big screen tv in front of me .  i don ' t really want to see stabbings and blood spurting while i ' m eating .  the biggest problem with the setting ,  though ,  was the music .  a never - ending procession of smooth jazz played at an uncomfortably high volume .  i want to know ,  who actually enjoys that music ?  my friend said it felt like being trapped in a dentist ' s waiting room .   the food .  my friend who ordered beef patties said that they were lousy .  and we all agreed that the rice and peas were completely flavorless .  it came in a  ' bowl '  the size of a tea cup .  as i mentioned ,  the jerk chicken was tasty ,  but the portion laughably small .  the large portion meal at yah mon is significantly smaller than the regular portion at jerk hut .  i understand that it ' s organic ,  but when you order the large portion ,  you shouldn ' t go home hungry .  and that ' s exactly what i did .    the only reason i ' m not giving 1 star is because some of the minuscule portions of food were tasty .   obviously ,  none of us are going back ,  and i couldn ' t recommend yah mon to anyone with whom i wanted to stay friends .

    "text": "it is with a heavy heart that i have to write this review .   i gave this place so many second chances because i used to work in the building it resides in ,  the indiana historical society ,  and was the closest option for lunch .   the complaint is with the service .   i could list the numerous times when an order i placed earlier in the day wasn ' t ready on time ,  but that is a special arrangement for ihs employees .  but in my last week ,  everything went downhill .  the first incident occurred when i ordered a salad with no dressing .  one of the cooks had to exclaim in the nearly empty cafe  \" no dressing ?  !  ?  who in their right mind doesn ' t eat dressing ?  !  \"  this is just out and out unnecessarily rude .  as a former food server ,  i ' ve ran across my fair share of bizarre food orders ,  and one doesn ' t say anything about it until the customer is gone or go somewhere  the customer can ' t hear you ,  and say it there .  i said something to the manager ,  which rendered dirty looks from the cooks and a retaliation .  the final time i ate there :  once again my early order for a grilled cheese was late .  i was made to wait 20 minutes of my 30 minute lunch break to cook a two cheese and tomato sandwich .  when i got it ,  the cheese was barely warm and not melted .  i complained ,  and was thrown attitude back from the manager for not ordering sooner .  ordering at 10 : 30 am for a 1 : 30pm pick up is not early enough ?  for a half - assed grilled cheese ?  !   the cook who criticized my food choice earlier in the week gave me a condescending smile from the kitchen .  the retaliation was complete .  and i was not given a refund .   final straw .  i wanted to forewarn everyone that the cooks  ( for now )  apparently have no respect for customers ,  and aren ' t afraid to show it .  management and the cooks are in a revolving door mode ,  so i have no doubt that they will be gone soon enough .  so i might recant this review in the future .   normally the food is fantastic and i can totally recommend the curry chicken salad sandwich ,  the french fries  ( crack fries as the employees call them )  ,  the quiches ,  and the grilled cheeses  -  when they are fully cooked .

    "text": "went for lunch today ( sunday )  and sat at the bar .   that was a big mistake since it was not that crowded and we could have sat at a table .   they had one bartender for a large bar and she was doing drink orders for the rest of the place also .   it took 25 minutes to get our food ,  which was cold by the time we got it .   i am not a big fan of cold fries .   all attempts to get the attention of the bartender prior to the eventual arrival of our foot were fruitless .     the food might have been good had we gotten it in a timely manner .   clearly they need two bartenders or else not serve food at the bar .

    "text": "let ' s preface with fact that i am a fan of mexican cuisine ,  it is pretty much a food group in our family .  i had heard red mesa was very good ,  so we made a 30 +  mile trip to visit .    2nd preface ,  it is really cold in fl this week ,  for us .     # 1 of three strikes  -  no heat in restaurant .  i don ' t mean poorly operating heat ,  i mean no heat .  no apology ,  no comp soup ,  no extra candle .  nada .     # 2 no liquor ,  they do have beer ,  wine ,  and wine margaritas .  suggestion ,  if the wine margarita is any good ,  offer a 1 . 5 oz portion with you chips as a sample    # 3 strike -  sides of rice and beans were cold ,  rice cooked to a consistency of wallpaper paste .    didn ' t stay for dessert ,  too cold .  my wife never had both her gloves off during dinner .    ok the good ,  yes there was good .  the crab and shrimp stuffed grouper with poblano cream sauce was excellent .    chips and salsa were above average .  negro modelo on draft excellent and served in a stylish gold rimmed glass -  nice touch .    the pork verde was average .    dear owner / manager ,  i tried to find you on saturday 1 / 9 to tell you how i felt ,  but the staff couldn ' t find you ,  i did leave you my name and  #  on my cc receipt .

    "text": "ramen is good .  it ' s expensive ,   $ 11 -  $ 14 a bowl .  tucson tends to be more expensive ,  but i ' m from la and i ' m used to  $ 6 - 9 a bowl .   service is eh .  waiting system is stupid you have to wait in line ,  not just write a name down .  super fun in the tucson heat .  there are also signs all around insisting that the waiting system isn ' t stupid .  which makes it feel even more so .  i ' ve eaten here several times ,  and getting a check is very hard as well .  every single time .  so is getting change for your check .  the waiting system would make more sense if they had quicker service ,  but considering i usually wait for my check about 10 minutes after i finish eating ,  they should let you write you name and sit around the corner .  i hope they listen to the feedback insisting that the customers are wrong .  the customers will keep you open !  if there ' s a wait ,  i always leave .  if there ' s no wait i consider eating here .
