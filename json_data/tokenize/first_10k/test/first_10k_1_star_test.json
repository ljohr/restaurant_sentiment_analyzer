    "text": "i took an 8 year old and a 14 year old for the lunch special pizza .   we have done this on several occasions ,  and the kids love that they each get their own personal pizza ,  made the way they like .    they both ordered their pizza with 2 items and wanted bbq sauce as the base instead of tomato sauce .    ( this is the only way they enjoy pizza )  .    i was told that they could only get tomato sauce ,  not bbq sauce .    i explained that we have gotten it this way several times before .    we were told that they don ' t offer it this way any more .    i see that some of the pizzas offer bbq sauce and pointed it out ,  but again was told that it couldn ' t be made this way for them .    i asked if i could pay additional to have it made with bbq sauce ,  but once again told it was not possible .    sadly ,  we left the restaurant and chose a different nearby restaurant for lunch .   i ' m sorry to say i won ' t be able to take the kids here anymore .

    "text": "the beer selection really is fabulous ,  but with drafting room up the road and victory a few miles away ,  you have to have good food and equally good service to win over those competitors .   after several visits ,  today was easily the most appalling service out family has ever received from any establishment ,  ever !  from the level of irritation of us walking in as the staff was just setting up  ( we walked in at 10 : 45am ,  the restaurant opens at 10 : 30am as posted on the website )  ,  for brunch ,  to the series of unreal circumstances that took place over the next hour ,  i am still in a state of shock .  we were ignored for the first ten minutes ,  despite my asking if we had somehow arrived  \" too early \"  and getting a simple  \" you ' re fine \"  in response ,  no eye contact ,  and no attempt to counter the whispering in each other ' s ears and rolling their eyes at us .   fast forward to the meal ,  we received our appetizers of tater tots and then our waitress ,  katie ,  went back to drinking beer at the bar with the other servers while we sat in search of ketchup .  i finally got up and went to the bar to ask the gentleman bartender for ketchup .  katie then retrieved two sides of ketchup for us .  when i said thank you ,  her response was  \" sure \"  .   ( also ,  i can look past the blond hair that was inside our tots but it was adding insult to injury at this point .  )  our breakfast came ,  the food was indeed good but the service was soooo bad .  my two boys eventually went to sit on the leather couch and play together ,  clearly disturbing the on - shift wait staff eating at the bar and chatting .  when my boys walked back to the table they were saturated with the smell of body odor from the couch .  i mentioned to one of the male members of the wait staff ,  that the leather sofa smelled and that they might want to wipe them down when the day was through .  he said  \" oh ,  really ,  i can ' t tell ,  my sense of smell isn ' t all that good \"  and then  \" we ' ll make katie take care of it \"  as he walked over to katie and another female to openly mock me for making a comment on the couch .  all of this in front of my children ,  the oldest of which was completely confused by why his mom was being made fun of .  not the example we set for our children .   we will never ,  ever ,  ever be back to wob exton and i will recommend skipping this establishment to every person who will listen .

    "text": "ok food .  .  .  horrible customer service !  one weekend i ordered 4 extra large pizzas  ( totaling  $ 65 with a coupon )  and when we received our order it was completely wrong .   i called to report the issue and adam  ( who claimed that he was a manager )  said that he would  \" take care \"  of my order next time .   he also asked me to take pictures of my pizzas  ( which i did )  .   the following week i called pizza guys to place my order .   prior to placing my order ,  i informed the girl of my arrangement with adam .   she responded with  \" hmmm .  .  .  hold on and let me figure that out \"  .   adam came to the phone and when i reminded him of our arrangement ,  he took my order  ( which was the exact same order as the one they messed up on )  ,  he told me that the total was  $ 88 !   when i reminded him again of our agreement ,  he then stated that he can  \" discount my order significantly \"  bringing it down to  $ 60 .   i told him that i was not satisfied with that .   if i had them correct the order the first time ,  i would not have paid for their error then ,  so why should i pay for it this time ?   adam told me that was the best he can do .  .  .  even as a manager !   i asked who his boss was and he stated that she was standing right next to him .   i asked to speak with her .  he placed me on hold for about five minutes only to return and say that she sent him back to the phone and tell me that the best she can do was to bring the cost down to  $ 55 .  come to find out that this was the owner !  she did not even have the decency nor respect to come to the phone and talk to me .   instead of trying to correct their error ,  they acted as if i was just trying to get some free food !  i have never been so insulted nor experienced such poor customer service !   i will never order from this location ever again !   i even spoke with director of operations regarding the issue and although he apologized and asked for another chance ,  i told him that i would not feel comfortable nor would i put it past that staff to put something in my food !   in my opinion ,  customer service is just as important as the quality of food i am purchasing .   again  -  i will never order from this location again ,  and if you think that customer service is just as important as i do ,  then you won ' t order from them either !

    "text": "the food here is amazing but is completely tarnished by the terrible waitress .  if 0 stars was an option i would have selected that considering that the waitress attempted to murder my friend .  the orders began as normal with myself and my friends informing the waitress that someone in our group is severely allergic to cucumber and that none of our dishes can contain cucumber .  she said  \" okay ,  the beef dish contains cucumber so do you want it taken out ?  \"  we said  \" yes \"  .  the first order of dishes came out without cucumber and all was fine .  the second order of dishes did not go well as cucumber was included on the dish .  we asked the bus boy to take the dish back and he said he would have to get the waitress who came back and yelled at us that we did not inform her of a food allergy .  she continuously yelled stating  \" you ordered it like this \"  ,   \" i only brought what you ordered \"  ,   \" you get what you asked for \"  and proceeded to get closer to my friend and yell in her face while my friend calmly tried to explain that we said we cannot have any cucumber on the table .  she took the plate and then had the bus boy bring it back without cucumber .  given the severity of the allergy ,  we moved the plate to the opposite of our friend .  we were unsure if the plate was taken back and just replated without cucumbers and felt that anaphylaxis wasn ' t worth it .  after yelling ,  she refused to come back to our table the rest of the night and sent bus boys to take our requests .  if you or anyone here has any food allergy ,  it ' s not worth the risk because even normal forewarning is useless here and if you try to clear up any misunderstanding the waitress may yell at you like they are from wwe .  the busboys deserve all the credit for making the night salvageable as they were attentive ,  courteous ,  and on top of it .
