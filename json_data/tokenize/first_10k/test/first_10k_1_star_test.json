    "text": "went here based on the high ratings and raves from people .   the entire experience was underwhelming from start to finish .   their website which is fairly useless if you want to figure out the menu before going ,  you have to pick your location choice out of 3 locations and then drill down to the bottom to see the weak descriptions of their menu offering ,  no explanations and no price ,  just this      roast beef     roast beef combo     roast pork     roast pork combo     baked ham     baked ham combo     roast turkey     roast turkey combo     broccoli rabe     broccoli rabe combo   no explanation of whats in a combo  ( its just where they add cheese by the way )   the table placecard  ( instead of menu )  had a more detailed description than the website .     when i walked in ,  its more bar than restaurant ,  no big deal ,  but there were tables .   since i couldnt decide and the sandwiches werent too expensive at  $ 6 . 85 ,  i got the roast beef and roast port combos .   i got my two sandwiches fast enough ,  but the roast beef was cold and the roast pork was hot .   not sure how a cook  ( for lack of a better word )  could serve 2 things at the same time with such a temperature differential ,  one was obviously sitting for awhile .   i asked the waitress to reheat the roast beef while i finished the roast pork ,  and supposedly it was reheated ,  since it was warmer ,  but it was still cold - ish compared to my roast pork i had just finished .   the waitress did offer to replace it when she inquired ,  but i was in a hurry and didnt really care for a hot version of this sandwich .   the sandwiches were very skimpy on meat ,  but they  \" made up for it \"  by adding too much gravy to make it overly messy and the bread was disintegrating .   the menu place card mentions the  \" wet meat \"  option where you get less gravy ,  i strongly recommend you get it that style ,  especially if the gravy overpower the meat and structural integrity of the sandwich .

    "text": "wow !   i just wrote a scathing review about el patron pizza in tampa for leaving unwanted and unwelcome fliers under the door of unsuspecting tourist here in tampa .   i was going to use a lot of the same issues for this review of new york pizza grill ,  but now i ' m not sure what to say ,  only to say it carefully .   i knew there was something not quite right about the greasy looking punk that was meandering in the hallway of the 4 star hotel where i am currently residing .   as soon as i saw the flier i grabbed my room key and went looking for this person .   in hindsight that was not smart ,  as soon as i got a look at the guy ,  i ran for the elevator .   now ,  i am no shrinking violet ,  but this guy looked like he ' s slap his own mother .   after reading the other reviews on here ,  i guess i should be happy that this employee didn ' t turn around and attack !   my biggest issue with this business is that they litter the halls and rooms with these fliers .   they sneak into hotels ,  a place where you feel safe and after this ,  i don ' t .   it doesn ' t seem to matter where it is a 5 star hotel chain or a family run business .   i did call every one of the pizza place that do this ,  because i felt bad about complaining to the staff at the hotel ,  but after yesterdays run in with greasy guy for new york pizza grill ,  i had it .   i do not feel safe and i told management that ,  and the did call the police .   so ,  for the employee of new york pizza grill ,  if you get caught stuffing fliers under doors where you are not invited and do not belong ,  you are more than likely going to be arrested .   so when you are out and about making not enough to keep your car running ,  ask yourself if your boss will bail you out of jail .   i doubt it ,  they ' ll probably just get another less than intelligent person to litter ,  trespass ,  annoy and sometimes terrify ,  hotel staff and their guests .   there are numerous reasons not to eat at new york pizza grill ,  but i ' m just tossing out a good reason not to work for them .

    "text": "do not eat here .  my husband ,  two friends and i went out for restaurant week to marmont steakhouse on saturday ,  january 26 ,  2013 ;  our experience was horrific .   the four of us ordered the crab bisque soup for our first course ,  it was cold and we sent it back to be reheated .   my second course was the calamari it was bland ,  fried too hard and rubbery .   finally two ppl from our party ordered the lobster ravioli for an entree .   it was not lobster ravioli but beef .  i asked our waiter and one other waiter to please double check with the chef because this is not lobster ,  i expressed that i have not eaten beef or pork since 1994 ,  and that it would make me ill .  they both came back separately and argued that it was in fact lobster .  another party of maybe 6 ppl ordered the lobster ravioli ,  they had the same problem and sent their dishes back to the kitchen too .   the server finally came over after i ' d eaten two of the ravioli to apologize for the kitchens error and telling us that was in fact beef .   i have been in the bathroom all day with diarrhea from the beef ravioli !  the staff was very nonchalant about it and offered an insincere apology .

    "text": "this hotel was so terrible and i can narrow it down to 4 things :   1 .  the price :  expect to pay a lot of money from the second you arrive .  they charge  $ 35 per person for a round trip shuttle ride to the airport .  our room was roughly  $ 275 a night .  it ' s an incredibly large hotel that offers a nail salon ,  a godiva chocolate store ,  about 9 restaurants and a few bars .  but you ' ll pay dearly for any of those things  -  like  $ 2 . 50 for a small bottle of soda .  the hotel is designed to keep you in there and they charge you  $ 15 for a round trip shuttle ride to the downtown nashville area .    2 .  the service :  we called the front desk and were on hold for 20 minutes .  we went to the front desk and waited in line for an hour .  we waited around to ask the concierge questions .  and each time we got ,   \" i don ' t know \"  as the usual response .  the cleaning staff was extraordinarily loud and they actually shouted as they went down the hall at 6 : 30 a . m .   3 .  the name :  they call this place a resort but that is ,  by far ,  a misnomer .  this place is a convention hotel ,  period .  it ' s horrifically loud at all hours of the day because they host about 3 conventions at one time .  our windows faced one of the courtyards and there is music pumping there 24 hours a day .  the walls are thin and you can hear  * everything *  happening in the neighboring rooms .   ( eww !  )  if you want to relax at a resort ,  don ' t stay here because with all those convention people ,  loud cleaning staff ,  24 hour music and thin walls you will only end up with more stress .   4 .  the size :  it ' s no joke that you will get lost in this hotel .  it ' s inexplicably large .  and when it hits noon ,  you should already be in one of the few restaurants because they fill up fast .  with several conventions happening at one time ,  getting a  \" quick bite \"  is not possible here .  and there ' s not really any place close by ,  either .  you can walk over to the mall for some fast food but plan enough time for your walk  -  getting out of the hotel takes at least 5 minutes .   i ' m sure glad i was there for a convention and didn ' t pay out of my own pocket for this ridiculous hotel .

( paraphrasing )  .  the bartender says  \" sure !  \"  and proceed to service this group ,  one - by - one ,  as they order drinks .  ok ,  fine technically ,  i was looking at the menu when this started .  but still ,  he walked back and forth ,  right in front of me ,  for about 10 - 12 minutes .  not once did he say ,   \" hey ,  just shout and i will get you something \"  ,  or  \" hey man ,  just give me a few minutes and i will be right with you \"  .  nothing !   it was obvious it was a big group ,  but i mean ,  he gave no acknowledgement to the fact that i was sitting there waiting !    long story short  -  after this 10 - 12 minutes of waiting ,  i just walked out and went somewhere else .  now this place has about 4\\5 stars with around 500 reviews .  so ,  i guess people like it .  but their bartenders are as unfriendly as i have ever encountered .   maybe if you get a table it ' s different .

    "text": "i have been to the blind tiger on multiple occasions for everything from business meetings to pleasure like this morning .  it has a great atmosphere inside and is in a convenient location .  and after this mornings experience ,  along with multiple subpar visits ,  i had to write a review .  the staff ' s attitude is always hit or miss on whether or not they are having a good day .  i walked in this morning about 30 minutes after opening .  it was quiet inside because it is an early sunday morning .  i said good morning to the girl who looked like she was mad at the world .  okay ,  we all have bad days and this wasn ' t the first time experiencing this there so i blew it off .  i stated that i wanted my order to go and order two drinks .  i asked about a pastry which was told it was a guava and cheese  ( one of my favorites )  so i ordered one of those too .  i sitting outside and walked back in after a few minutes to check on my order .  i saw that the pastry was boxed up  ( which i appreciate the personal touch of their logo on the box )  and then was told my first drink was ready .  it wasn ' t in a to go cup so it had to be fixed .  instead of the barista handing it to me at the counter where i grabbed the pastry and was waiting ,  maybe three feet from the barista ,  she made me walk down to her to grab the cup instead of her walking to me .  i walked back outside to wait on my second order ,  came back in a few minutes later to my next drink just being finished .  i told the barista that the drink looked beautiful from the design she made on top and got zero response .  and no have a good day ,  thank you ,  nothing .  instead the ladies were talking about what food they wanted to eat .  again ,  i was the only one who they were waiting on because it was a sunday morning .  i left and began drinking my coffee and it wasn ' t hot and my boyfriend ' s wasn ' t either ,  but it wasn ' t worth going back after all of that .  and to top it all off ,  when i got home to eat the pastry ,  it didn ' t have any cheese in it and barely any guava and i threw part of it away .  what blows my mind even more is that they hold training classes for those who want to learn more about coffee .  they should focus more on making sure their staff is performing up to expectations as today they failed in almost every way possible .

    "text": "my husband and i stopped here for lunch on a saturday afternoon around 2 - ish .   the restaurant was completely empty .   we inquired if they were even open and a nice lady said they were and proceeded to seat us .    their menu did not offer as many options of meat types or dishes as most mexican restaurants do here in indianapolis .   my husband ordered a margarita and the special of the day ,  chilaquilles con salsa verde y pollo at  $ 6 . 99 and i ordered a carne asada burrito at  $ 7 . 99 and water to drink .  chips and salsa were brought to the table .   chips were  fried there ,  and while i like that style of chip  ( thin ,  often bubbles into thin layers )  but were cold and very greasy .   salsa was sweet but had some heat in the finish .   it was easy to eat a lot of those !  when our meals came to the table ,  frankly ,  they were underwhelming .   my burrito tortilla looked / felt like it was not heated at all and cutting into my burrito was disappointing .   there was lots of lettuce and tomato ,  a scoop of a white rice  ( not spanish rice )  and there was supposed to be mozzarella cheese in it but couldn ' t taste or see it .   the carne asada was thinner than a strip of bacon .   unfortunately ,  i would be generous in saying there was maybe 2 ounces of beef .   in all honesty ,  there was no more meat in it than two strips of bacon ,  diced .   my husband mentioned it to the person  ( owner )  with a quick  \" sorry \"  muttered and no offer to do anything .    while the combination of ingredients was not improperly prepared ,  there are 100 other mexican restaurants in town i can spend  $ 8 . 00 on a burrito and it would be generously filled with meat .  as for my husband ' s chilaquilles ,  i order this all the time from biscuits in broad ripple and this was another disappointment .   this was chips ,  salsa verde ,  one fried egg and a very thin boneless piece of grilled chicken .   my husband felt as i did .   not poorly prepared but completely lacking any substance .   during the time we spent in this restaurant ,  there was not one other customer coming or going .   with the lack of substance to the food ,  i suspect most people will feel as i did and would not waste their time coming back here .   there is no way this restaurant can survive when prices are the same as other mexican restaurants but quality is far less .   sadly ,  i was even mad that we spent  $ 25 . 00 at this place and left just to drive to a fast food restaurant so we could get some quick ,  cheap protein .    i will chalk this up to a learning experience .   folks ,  save your money and go to rosita ' s or margaritas u . s .  31 ,  leonardo ' s or even el meson .

    "text": "quite disappointed  -  not in the chain ,  but certainly in this location .  this is the third time in a row we ' ve had problems with our meal .  the last caused us not to come back for over a year  -  and we should have stayed away .   on this sunday evening ,  the restaurant was busy ,  but not jammed .  there were five in our party ,  and we continually had to remind our server about things we were missing before our meals even arrived  -  butter ,  silverware sets ,  refills on beverages .  .  .    i ordered a 13oz ribeye ,  rare ,  with only squash from the mixed vegetables .  when it arrived 20 minutes later ,  the uneven piece of meat was medium rare on the thick end ,  and medium to well the rest of the cut  -  and i had a full serving of mixed vegetables with only one piece of squash .  the manager took it to recook the order  -  and brought back a piece of meat so rare it was cold in the center and tough .  i was hungry ,  so i chomped my way through .   another steak was over - cooked ,  a third plate was missing sour cream and butter for a potato ,  cold shrimp on a fourth ,  and almost raw  ( crunchy )  vegetables on the fifth .   the manager  ( cody )  apologized when he took my plate ,  but never checked back to see if my issue was resolved and for us to tell him about the other problems at the table .  when the check arrived  -  full price .  no offer of a dessert for the issues ,  nothing off the bill .   we will not be back .  jesse ' s is just a bit up the road ,  and the quality of both the food and the service are head and shoulders above this outback .   one shout - out  -  kate was great in helping to resolve issues ,  but she was tied up training someone else and we didn ' t see her again .

    "text": "we have loved schlafly for many years as we lived just blocks away and love their beer and food .  so ,  when we had guests in town ,  we decided to drive a bit and take them to bottleworks on a nice fall day to enjoy a few drinks before dinner at our place .  what in the heck happened to this place ?  saturday afternoon ,  the patio was about 2 / 3 full ,  but we got a 30 - 45 minute wait for 15 people including a few babes .  on top of that ,  we were told we had to order food if we sat on the patio .  fine ,  we will order a few appetizers .  nope ,  it had to be entrees .  after promising to make it up to the server and tip well ,  we were given a pager .  waited 45 minutes to be seated as we watched tables sit empty .  once seated ,  some of our group ordered entrees because the server made them feel bad ,  so that made the meal i already had prepared completely worthless .  the topper was when we got our checks ,  the server told us we were not as bad as she expected and to come back again when we got babysitters for the babies .  so is there some new trend in hospitality to treat your guests like this that should make them want more ?   i do hold a special place in my heart for this place as we used to walk there with our kids all the time and even hit up their markets and other events ,  but i was so embarrassed for talking this place up the way i did and actually driving more than a mile to go here .  surely ,  schlafly realizes that there is another great brewery right down the street that has a much better vibe and appreciation for their guests .  live and learn .

    "text": "beware that this place charges  $ 18 per day for parking and a  \" resort fee \"  of  $ 15 for internet access ,  2 bottles of water a day and on line access to a newspaper site .  i reserved our room on line ,  and only found out about these fees when looking at the reviews on yelp when trying to find if any of the restaurants in the resort were worth trying .  i called and spoke to a manager on duty about these fees and she refused to refund the fees since i checked the terms and conditions box on the reservations page .  i informed the mod that i had neglected to read all of the terms and conditions ,  therefore she refused to help .  after returning home i looked at the terms and conditions on the reservations page ,  where the check box appears and indeed it does tell of the  $ 15 resort fee ,  but fails to mention the  $ 18 parking fee .    this room was  $ 250 per night before taxes .  the room was nothing special .  i ' ve stayed in la quinta inns and other places that were just as nice ,  if not better ,  for far less .    i also was left wondering what happened to the southern hospitality that us southerners are supposed to be so well known for .   when i pay  $ 250 a night for a room ,  i don ' t expect to be charged exorbitant fees for things i get for free at far less expensive hotels .

( should be  $ 4 .  )   instead of giving him his change back ,  they tell him it is  $ 20  -   $ 16 for the platter and  $ 4 for the side .    ( sudden price increase ?  !  ?  !  )   my friend argues with them briefly and tells him that isn ' t what they agreed to before and he just wants the change .   the guy refuses so my friend leaves ,  having paid an extra  $ 4 .   bottom line :  don ' t eat here !   they ' re dishonest and completely rude .   oh ,  and on top of that ,  the food was bland .   spent  $ 20 for bland food .   shame .    ( no ,  my opinion about the food wasn ' t biased by his experience .   he told me after we ate so i would still enjoy my food and not go out and tear them a new one .  ) ",

    "text": "one of the worst service experience .  i ordered egg roll and the pho .  egg rolls came out covered with burn crumbles all over and very drak color of the shell and you could the content pretty much black color as if it was almost burned or at the least fried in the last drop of over used burned oil and i could not posssibly put it in my mouth .  when i was explaining that im concerned things are too burned ,  the owner lady walked up and snatched the plate away from me without saying anything .  i did not know if they ate bringing another one or not .  only after i grabbed my waiter later he said they are not making another one ans would take it off my check .   absolutely rude ,  not communicating ,  disrespectful of their customers .  .   the only reason i came was because the neighboring miss saigoin restaurant was flooded but i think it ' s worth a wait compared to this place if i want to spend any money for pho and walk out feeling happy  :  ( ",

    "text": "ok had sunday lunch with my mother and grandmother here and it was just terrible .  our server didn ' t even tell us his name and took forever for him to take our drink order .  we asked for sweet and low with one of our unsweet teas and didn ' t receive it .  had to ask for it again to then receive the sweet and low .  we ordered the bloomin onion and the chesse fries .  the bloomin onion was not the onion the restaurant usually uses because it was on the spicy side .  the chesse fires when on the ok side since they did not put much chesse or bacon on the appetizer .  so in all reality we ordered a plate of fires with a little chesse and bacon .  my grandmother ordered the 6oz steak and it was also on the spicy side .  i however ordered the same thing but i ordered mine medium rare but when i got my steak it was rare instead of medium rare and also was really spicy .   we then had to ask for a bottle of steak sauce because if you ask for steak sauce for a party of three you will only get one tiny cup full of steak sauce for the whole table .  had to order a to go order for my father couldn ' t make it to lunch and our waiter said he would put it in after we had finished our meal .  when we finished our food and the waiter gave us our check we still haven ' t received our to go order .  had to sit and extra five to ten minutes to get that said order .  lets just say we gave a bad tip .  be caution to this place not worth a hundred dollar bill for a spicy mouth and bad experience !

( or maybe fries were over - cooked and dry from sitting under the warmer for 5 minutes as i stared at it .  )  turkey blt was subpar and the kids chicken fingers were over - cooked too .    i ' m surprised the server came by later and asked how our meals were  ( albeit robotic )  but not surprised that when we said i got the wrong cheese ,  she said  \" sorry \"  without any suggestions or offers to make good on her mistake .    we were ready to pay and eager to leave .  .  . we waved down another server who said she couldn ' t take our payment as our assigned server had to do it .  we said  \" can you let her know ?  \"  and she said  \" i can ' t ,  she ' s with another table \"  and walked away .  we were in disbelief that this experience just got worse .    the only good memorable moment was when i said under my breath  \" this place is terrible ,  \"  and my young son repeated me .    advice :  hire people who are actually friendly or shut it down .  this is an embarrassment .  will never go there again and probably never go to another friendly ' s ever .

    "text": "i had a friday night business dinner scheduled elsewhere ,  but we couldn ' t get a table until after 9 : 30pm so we decided to try timpano .  had no problem getting in  &  now i know why .  we had one of the worst meals  &  i spent almost  $ 180 . 00 .  we sat outside ,  which was charming ,  except  we felt  lucky when the waiter showed up at our table .  he was rushed  &  apologized for the lack of wine choices .  the bread was wonderful .  .  .  the osso buco was hard ,  dry  &  so salty it was inedible .  sent that back ,  the waiter was nice about it ,  brought back the scallop dish which was still oversalted  &   really bad .   the side of grilled ,  burnt ,  slimy asparagus was also salty  &  over cooked .  and i truly wanted to send it back because it was horrible .  .  .  . did i mention cold ?  but we were starting to get in a hurry to leave so we could wash out the bad taste in our mouth .   my chicken dish was better than a microwave one from big lots ,  but the chicken was chewy ,  rubbery ,  4 sure not organic ,  farm raised .  .  .  must be steroid chicken  ,  no taste ,  and i cannot remember the name of the dish ,  i believe it had a few morsels of pasta with it .   ughh .  .  .   the 1 star is for our waiter  ,  he was ok ,  but i am so over egoist ,  affected ,  waiters telling me about their view on wine ,  when they obviously have no clue .  i mention a gaja barberesco  &  he suggests the amarone .  and he continued with a soliloquy on all the names of top italian wines he knew  &  10 minutes go by  &   guess what ,  they did not offer 1 of the them on their wine list !   so he wastes time trying to show me he knows wine ' s names ,  but timpanodoes not carry them .   the beat thing i orderes was the cocktail i had in the beginning with elderflower liquor ,  a splash of soda muddled mint  &   cucumber .  that was so refreshing .   my associate polished most of the wine choice off her self .  which was good and was priced ok ,  i think the bottle was around  $ 40 . 00 .   their wine list is minimal .   we expected an italian restaurant but it was more a new york steak house . the food was ordinary ,  over salty ,  waaay over priced .  and don ' t get me started on the duo they booked 4 entertainment .  .  .  bottom line ,  that area of hyde parkis in construction  &  renovation so stay away .  wait 4 goody goody 2 open !  that is something that i hear will be worth the parking hassle !

( i think all customers would have appreciated knowing upfront that these items and services were unavailable .  )   service disappointments :  while our initial interaction with our waitress was seemingly standard and friendly ,  i can ' t provide any additional positive feedback about her because we barely saw her again . the waiter who brought us our beverages informed us of their lack of diet coke and forgot 2 / 3 waters .  we spent over 35 minutes trying to make eye contact with our waitress to get her attention  -  and although we made eye contact ,  she never came over .   we spent 45 minutes waiting for refills on water and coffee  ( and of course our food )  ,  while other customers who had been seated after us and were simply sitting closer to the kitchen enjoyed their food .  at this point i stood up and walked over towards the kitchen to request refills ,  and a different waitress said she would be right with us .  ten minutes later our waitress came over with refills and said our food shouldn ' t be much longer .    this is now 55 minutes into our breakfast .   ( just to be clear we all ordered eggs and the restaurant was not full .  )  while she was at our table we requested a set of utensils  ( since only 2 / 3 of our party was given a set of utensils when we were seated )  .  in addition we requested salt and ketchup  -  because at this point we had high hopes our food would be arriving soon and our table was not prepared with these items unlike the other tables near us .   finally over an hour after being seated our food arrived with unmelted cheese on the eggs and 2 packets of ketchup for our table of 3 .  when the waitress walked away we took the bottle of ketchup from an empty table nearby and ate our breakfast .    this was a disappointing visit to say the least .  i recommend you do not visit this establishment under any circumstances .

    "text": "stay away .  my husband and i stopped here this afternoon to use a gift card given to us a long time ago .  we do not normally buy cold stone ice cream ,  and we ' re pretty easy to please .  all we were looking for was a nice cold treat on a hot day -  what we got was a small ice cream that was way too sweet  ( yes ,  even for ice cream !  )  ,  and a chocolate shake that was not good ,  for about  $ 11 .  my husband took one sip of his shake and pushed it away .  i took a taste and agreed that something was not right .  it had a distinctly sour ,  bitter aftertaste .  while i finished my ice cream ,  he debated about whether he wanted something else instead .  since the ingredients seemed to be the problem ,  he decided did not want something else ,  even though my ice cream seemed fine .  when i took the shake back to the register and explained the problem ,  we were told we could not receive a refund ,  only a replacement .  both of us had an upset stomach for about two hours afterwards ,  and neither of us had more than a sip or two .  poor customer service ,  bad ingredients .  food poisoning is not worth  $ 11 ,  so we simply left .   poor customer service is my biggest pet peeve -  as someone who has worked in customer service and international sales for four years ,  i promise you -  it ' s really not that difficult of a task to make sure your customer is happy ,  even if there is a language / geographical barrier  ( today ,  there was neither )  .  while i realize that the employee i spoke to is probably a minimum wage high school student ,  store policies that young woman has to follow are set by real adults .  whoever set the policies for this store clearly is not doing their job !   shame on you ,  coldstone ,  for trying to give my  ( active - duty  &  a veteran )  husband food poisoning on memorial day ,  and refusing to make any real attempt to make amends .  don ' t worry ,  you sure as hell won ' t see us again ,  ever .  fool me once .  .  .  .

    "text": "so incredibly disappointed in this restaurant .   we were so excited to try this new location of herbie ' s and it did not live up to expectations .   the food was not to the quality of the prices that they charged on the menu .   the hostess sat us and the older manager was visibly not happy with where we were seated in the restaurant .   the french onion soup lacked flavor and could have used salt and pepper .   it lacked the beefy / wine flavoring that a good french onion soup should have in it .   the beef wellington ,  although beautifully presented was disappointing .   it lacked flavor and had no seasoning in it .   the mushrooms / spinach / red pepper medley that it was paired with had canned red peppers in it .  seriously ,  a  $ 25 . 00 + plus dish with canned / jarred red peppers ?  it was like baby food .   the flank steak had no seasoning to it and the sauce that it was served with it also lacked flavor and tasted like mayo .   the chicken with shaved brussels sprouts salad was underwhelming .   the  \" 1 / 2 chicken \"  was the size of a cornish hen .  the server sold us on their  \" amazing \"  red velvet donuts for dessert .   that was a mistake .  the donuts were hard and not warm ,  the  \" white chocolate \"  icing was hard as well and there was stale broken up donuts sprinkled around the plate with the chocolate .   the coffee was also luke warm .   we will not be back .   herbie ' s needs to revisit their seasoning in the kitchen stat and rework their menu .
