    "text": "before i even start this review i have to thank my fellow yelpers .  there is no way i ,  or anyone for that matter ,  would have found this place if it weren ' t for someone just like you doing a review .  thanks guys !   tucked away in a strip shopping center ,  albeit a cute shopping center ,  is this little non descript  restaurant .  since it was early in the day ,  we really weren ' t worried about a reservation although i did call as a just in case measure .   we wanted to sit outside since the back looks so pretty but were told it was closed but were led instead to an enclosed patio .  still nice .    nicer still was when our server brought us bread ,  olive oil and a plate of marinated cannelloni beans with yellow and green squash .  wow !  the squash were just a tad bland and needed salt but the beans were really flavorful .   my husband ordered the squash blossoms stuffed with ricotta and mozzarella cheese and i the beef carpaccio .  although i did miss capers on the beef and there was too much salad ,  both the dishes were really good .   now ,  our server gave us the list of specials and mentioned that two of them were served with langostines .  i had seen these on one of the cooking shows but didn ' t know exactly what they were .  my husband ordered the carbonarra and i got the langostines with a blush sauce served with lump crab and fresh tomato .   my dish was pricey ,  yes it was but incredibly worth it .  imagine a cross between a lobster ,  a shrimp and butter .  really .  the langostines simply melt in your mouth leaving happiness behind .  the carbonarra with panchetta instead of bacon my husband ordered is the best i ' ve ever ordered or even tried to make .    as i ' ve said ,  we were really early so we got to watch the prep of the restaurant between the the lunch and the dinner service .  it was truly a privilege .  these servers went through the place with precision ,  dusting ,  wiping ,  washing and primping every aspect of the restaurant .    if you go ,  and you should ,  bring a nice bottle of wine ,  order the langostines and the tiramisu .  enjoy !

( although the butter cake starts getting stale within hours so eat it fast )  they are always so nice ;  gave a cookie to my daughter today while we waited in line .  most importantly ,  i just leaned they make breakfast sandwiches on fridays ,  saturdays and sundays .  they are excellent and come with western potatoes and a croissant .  you can see one half of a breakfast sandwich in my picture .  all of this for just  $ 6 . 99 .  a very good value considering their normal bakery items are a bit expensive  -  but worth it .
