    "text": "we were a bit weary about trying the shellfish company on the wharf as more often than not ,  many places like these  ( see cannery row ,  monterey )  feast on a captive audience and provide sub - standard fare at high prices .   however ,  emboldened by the perennial good reviews on yelp ,  we suppressed our initial observations and went ahead with the trying it out .  the place is small ,  so definitely plan ahead .  you will have to wait ,  so either you know ,  just do so ,  or perhaps try to visit outside of peak hours .  luckily ,  our wait was only about 20 minutes as the dinner rush was just leveling off .   the special was the local rock crab  -   $ 25 for 3 lbs of california rock crab ,  salad ,  and your choice of soup / chowder .  after taking a look at a few trays of rock crab being served out ,  the wife and i both opted for it ,  as it looked awesome .     the salad / chowder combo was great as you actually received hearty portions of each ,  so it was a good start .  as much as i liked the chowder however ,  the shrimp bisque the wife ordered was amazing ,  so i would recommend that going forward .    but enough of prattling on about side dishes :  the rock crab tasted just as glorious as it looked .  juicy ,  buttery chunks of white crab meat await you ,  just a few cracks away .  while the rock crab shells are pretty thick ,  once cracked ,  they splinter and separate easily ,  a good sign they are cooked to perfection .  the rock crabs provided a great amount of meat for what i felt to be the least amount of work you ' re going to do for crab ,  king or otherwise .    we were thoroughly satisfied with our meal and along with the special being an overall great value ,  devouring the rock crab at sbsc turned out to be one of the favorite meals on the trip .  i think ordering crab here is a safe proposition indeed .

    "text": "my friend and i visited tampa for a concert ,  and about ten minutes away from the atlanta airport he realized that he had purchased tickets for the wrong day .  we had already made hotel reservations and bought the concert tickets ,  so he just had to pay same - day price for airfare :  all in all about  $ 800 more .   \" it was totally worth it ,  \"  he later told me ,   \" because i got to have the best sandwich of my entire life .  \"   all because we randomly picked the bricks of ybor from yelp .  i can ' t vouch for the peanut butter or meatless menu ,  but the meat sandwiches that we bought were absolutely phenomenal .  i had the pulled pork ,  which was flavored with ponzu and served on hawaiian sweet bread .  it was one of the best meals i ' ve had in a long time .  we spent a few hours hanging out and drinking ,  during which time brian ,  the owner ,  came out and talked to us ,  comped us a drink ,  let us try new appetizers he was developing  ( all for free )  and generally made us feel really welcome .    i kept my eyes open to the kind of crowd that came in and out of the restaurant .  it seemed to draw everything from hipsters to geriatrics and strait - laced families with young kids .  i think it speaks to both the diversity of the menu and the pleasant environment .  we went back for drinks before and after the concert .  it got very crowded but we still received excellent food ,  drinks and service .  i give this restaurant my strongest recommendation ,  and it ' s the first place i ' m going when i next visit tampa .

( the other options were caesar salad and clam chowder )  .  they topped off the crab with a couple of onion rings and cups of cocktail sauce and drawn butter .  yum !   we also got the fried platter of shrimp ,  oysters ,  calamari and scallops for  $ 12 . 95 .  it came with cole slaw ,  onion rings ,  tartar sauce and cocktail sauce .  as greasy of a meal as this made ,  it was one of the better fried platters i ' ve had anywhere .  the seafood was just really fresh including the sometimes - feared fried oyster .   :  )   the ice in our iced teas melted away in the sun .  our waitress was so cool and brought us lots of extra ice and an extra iced tea in case we needed it  ( we did because it was hot out !  )  .  she was just friendly and good at her job  -  five stars for her !   by the time we left at about 6 ,  there were so many people waiting .  make sure you sign up for a seat on the clipboard right when you get there .  the restaurant is the last one at the very end of the pier .  parking on the pier is free for 90 minutes but it looks like a drive that will upset tires .  i parked in the large lot south of the pier and walked 15 minutes up and onto the pier .  it was free on a monday late afternoon .

    "text": "if you ' re looking for a great brunch place in new orleans ,  definitely come here !   my boyfriend and i had brunch here on sunday ,  and we loved it !  we both started with the brandy milk punch ,  which was divine .   if you are of age ,  order this drink !   it is an alcoholic milkshake ,  and i could literally go here just to drink that because it is so good .     they bring out fresh bread and butter ,  and then my boyfriend and i ordered the trio of appetizers .   the trio is quite small ,  but it includes a duck springroll ,  fried chicken livers and a fried oyster .   the duck springroll came with a wonderful tangy sauce ,  which i greatly enjoyed .   my boyfriend enjoyed the fried chicken livers and the fried oyster ,  but those are not two of my favorite things .   for my entree ,  i ordered the shrimp and grits .   oh my goodness .  .  .  so good !  the shrimp are bacon - wrapped ,  and the grits are true southern grits .   i will definitely order this dish again when i get the chance to return .   my boyfriend ordered the fish of the day ,  which was blackened mahi mahi ,  and he loved it .     definitely go to mr .  b ' s !

    "text": "first of all ,  i think this might be my first yelp review about  \" fast food .  \"  it ' s not a genre i ever eat unless i ' m forced to on a road trip .   however ,  i am from buffalo ,  ny ,  and am a chicken - finger connoisseur ,  so i decided to give this place a chance .   additionally ,  it was on a road trip of sorts .   we had been at the beach all day and were halfway back home to central tampa .   the service is amazing !   i have never seen fast - food workers who take so much pride in their jobs .   these people were drinking the zaxby ' s cool - aid !   they seemed more like disney employees than fast - food workers .   both a female counter gal and a male  ( possible the manager / franchisee )  went out of their way to make sure we liked everything .     the food was a solid 4 stars ,  but my review overall is rounded up for the above mentioned points .   we had the chicken finger sandwiches on texas toast .   while the chicken fingers themselves were super juicy and moist ,  the texas toast was too greasy to eat them on .   i love sauce and enjoyed the variety .   we tried the zax ,  hot honey mustard ,  insane hot and ranch .   what is missing from the sauce variety ,  for me ,  is a spicy bbq and blue cheese .   serving ranch with hot sauce is an insult to the folks in buffalo that created the cuisine .   aside from the bread and sauce small issues ,  i really enjoyed our meal .   additionally ,  it was so cheap !  !    $ 12 and change for 2 meals with drinks .     i am a fan !   this place doesn ' t quite hit all the marks of buffalo - inspired food ,  but it does a pretty good job of putting a southern twist on chicken fingers !

    "text": "after a long hiatus from reviewing i have awaken from my 6 mouth yelp hibernation and my tummies a grumbles with an insatiable hunger for the cacophonous symphony of flavor that is indian food .  like an all too familiar pattern ,  i go back to mohammad butt ,  my main man for marsala .  but whats this ?   there are whispers that he no longer cooks for  \" best taste of asia ,  \"  that he is gone ,  never to return ;  some sort of falling out .   no .  no ,  it can ' t be !   i need to score  -  one  .  .  final  .  .  hit .  .   life ceases to have meaning ,  existential murmurings dog the mind .  who am i ?  why am i here ?  what is cheeze wiz ?  its done ,  over ,  a round falls into the chamber and just as i prepare to end it all and pull the trigger -  steps in zaika .   zaika  -  meaning the art of taste  -   stays to to its name .  this is a place where the paneer  ( cheese )  is made fresh in house ,  resulting in a cheese that ' s silky in texture .  especially when in contrast to the prepackaged rubbery bone - white lego blocks most small indo - pak places purchase from indian grocers in attempts to reduce prep - times .  while at zaika such shortcuts are not taken ,   the chef takes the extra steps needed to ensure a dish comes together as a whole .  for example ,  the chicken makhani uses smokey tandoori chicken ,  which i have never seen done before but it certainly aids the chicken to cut though the rich buttery tomato sauce and elevates the dish as a whole .  even entr\u00e9es like dall fray or  palak paneer  have so much flavor that they will leave you not missing animal protein in the least should you choose to go the vegetarian route .    zaika  ' s appetizers ,  like the veggie samosa and aloo tikki ,   ( spiced potato patties )  are generally large ,  peppery and well spiced  -  the latter of which remind me of something my own mother would make .  though i must warn others to avoid the items that occasionally pop - up as specials like the potato stuffed chili peppers ,  unless they have a iron stomach or are a gluten for punishment .  these peppers are spicy ,  not deveined or even seeded .  further ,  i find the fish pakora to be far too fishy .    i ' ve become rather taken by zaikia .  even the simply things such as the naan are good there .  just right in elasticity ,  the bread does not have too much give and yet isn ' t too soft .  it ' s nothing elaborate ,  just properly risen with a light texture and  no egg or yeast flavor .  the only complaint being that it lacked that signature faint sweetness naan has .  but hey ,  i use it mostly for mopping up the other good stuff on the plate anyway and the sweetness gets lost in the mix ,  so i don ' t mind at all .   the menu has nearly 120 different items ,  all numbered to order by ,  making take - out phone orders convenient and should eliminate any fears anyone should have of a language barrier problem .  furthermore ,  it has short descriptions of each dish  -  something all ethnic places like this should have .  though some items like lassie  ( a frothy yogurt drink )  do not appear on the menu ,  that too is offered  -  both a salty and sweet mango verities .   the head chef speaks english quite well and should be easy to deal with should you want to inquire more or want to setup large orders .   i have already noticed parties negotiating catering for ramadan as i anxiously awaited my own order .   the bottom line here is this ,  mohammad butt has expanded on the menu he once created for  \" best taste of asia ,  \"  and taken an all halal meat approach .    only good things can come of this ,  only good things .   p . s .  zaika is right behind nifty fifties on grant ave .  ,  so you are all set for dessert should you want a milkshake .   however ,  i would suggest getting the ras malai if available .  these riccotta cheese dumplings flouting in soaked in sweetened ,  thickened milk are delicately flavored with cardamom ,  a very some amount of rose water and then garnished with pistachios .  they are ungodly good .

( and if for some reason at the end you didn ' t  finish your bottle they will cork it back up for you to take .  )  then select your cheese platter .  lots of yummy stinky cheese to select  from and prosciutto .  i wish they had more cured meats but it ' s all yummy anyway .  you pay for the wine and cheese there .  which in a large group one or two people can take care of this  part .    then going to get a seat can be difficult but just be patient .  there ' s outdoor seating that ' s very nice and always a live band playing .  inside upstairs is nice as well .  once you ' re all set with your wine and group it ' s time to order .  go to the window and play your order .  definite things you must get .  .  .  .  the bacon wrapped dates stuffed with chorizo and the goat cheese and mushroom dish .  .  .  . amazing !  although everything i ' ve ever had here is great .    then just wait for your cheese platter ,  food and enjoy !
