    "text": "Read Catherine L.'s review - and my sentiments are echoed.\n\nA close friend and I came here  for dinner.  When we had trouble finding the place (we were at the \"A Full Plate\" end of Liberties walk, we called on the phone and a nice man came out to get us and walked us over.  This, alas, was the best part of the meal.  Things got progressively worse and worse.\n\nFirst we were seated (inside - at our request) and our drink order was taken by a clearly overworked, spread-too-thin male server (who was very nice and tried his best - 3 stars for him).\n\nAfter taking our meal order we waited, and waited, and waited...\n\nAnd waited some more...\n\nAnd finally asked harried server to please bring our chips and salsa (as he had just brought some to another table nearby).  We were starvin'!\n\nThe smoky salsa and salsa verde arrive - in hot bowls \"fresh from the d/w\" and thus we had warm salsa.  Yech.  And the salty chips were \"chipettes\" (or to be mean - crumbs.)  smashed to smithereens.\n\nOK, things aren't so great - but we await our entrees.\nWow - Impressive looking - I order a single beef shortrib and feel like Fred Flintstone.  This thing is HUGE.   Gi-normous!  Like a brontosaurus rib.  Alas - there is no sauce.  My friend orders an \"OK\" pair of Chicken burritos that are no better than Qdoba.  \n\nSo here's the kicker...  About 3/4 through the entrees, frantic server appears again with a six-pack of sauce.  He gives me a bottle of HOT and a bottle of SWEET.  I pour out a bit of the sweet onto my plate (disregarding the crust around the rim of the squeez bottle) and dip my meat in.  UGH!!!  Racidity Central.\n\nThe HOT sauce is not rancid - and has a nice flavor but it just to hot for me.\n\nMy appetite is now officially GONE.\n\nAnd shortly thereafter, so were we.  I will not return.\n\nSuch a disappointment.",

Also, this is now the 2nd time the salmon tasted \"fishy\".  Fresh raw salmon should not taste this way.\n\nUnfortunately for me, my 8 year old ADORES the place - especially the tasty shrimp shumai (served with a saffron cream sauce and fresh sweet corn kernels) and california rolls.\n\nWe'll be back - and pray you won't take it out on us, but food and beverage quality needs to improve.\n\nThe female manager is very sweet.\nI think the guy hates me.  (He might really hate me now.)  \n\n:(",

    "text": "Meh.\nYou get what you pay for and they do go crazy with the Kewpie Mayo here - so either avoid rolls with mayo or ask for sauces on the side.\n\nI had seen the place (walked by) and read the other yelp reviews - but for $8 (2 maki - you can get 3 for $12) I figured I'd give it a shot.\n\nService was icy-cold at first (one lady was kinda mean - she was prepping a table for a large party that was not there yet and clearly did not want to stop to help another table) but then my \"real\" server showed up and was very sweet. Vibe is kinda icy too - with colored LEDlights that change color and rock-hard banquettes that are straight up & down and not that comfortable to sit at.  Water was brought instantly (YAY!) and green tea (which I had to ask for) was free.\n\nI ordered a yellowtail scallion roll (had decent yellowtail but hardly any scallion in it) and a roll with salmon and grilled onions (loaded with mayo blobs on top which I scraped off - seriously, at least 3-4 tsp. of mayo.  Eew).  It was also supposed to have masago but there was NOE in there - and when I asked the (sweet) girl about it she said they don;t include masago on the lunch special.\n\nThese people are certainly cost consious - as the lettuce & dressing salad indicated (no tomato, no nothin').\n\nI am in absolutely NO HURRY to come back here - yet - oddly enough - I ran into a friend here with another aquaintance and the LOVE it here.\n\nMeh. Meh. Meeeeeeh.\n\nSorry.\n\nDoma and Vics cost more - but are sooooo much better.\n\nNope.",

I have also been told that when they screw up, they screw up in a big way.  Well they screwed up today.\n\n I am rating Sabrina's on the abysmal way in which I was treated this morning at 9:40 AM.  Yes - on Saturday AM's the place gets slammed - but I was BY MYSELF - solo - and could have easily been greeted and asked to sit at the counter which had 4 open stools.  Since it was before 10 (don't even think about coming at 11 on a weekend) there were even 2 tables open (where the 2 other parties got seated.)\n\nNevertheless the host ignored me and proceeded to seat the party before (natch) and after me and NEVER GREETED me.  \n\nI pulled a menu off of the pile on the host/hostess stand and read it for a few minutes (sounded good- medium to high prices).  Still nothing.\n\nI just said \"screw it\" and left.\n\nI hope to actually get a chance to eat here in the future.  I guess singles aren't too welcome here.  Next time I'll bring my adorable 4 year old.  I bet we'll get seated.",

I had a so-so shrimp scampi (angel hair here is a definite AVOID - ads it is always overcooked and mushy.) and it was $16.95.\n\nThe unlimited iceberg & white-bread (Oh, sorry, I meant salad & grease-sticks) are a big turn on to college kids and cheap in-laws alike.\n\nFor my time & money - there are FAR better places to go (even in the spectra of Faux-talian chains.)

Mediocre - kinda dry.\nMozz. Sticks - cold\nScaliop pieces (or was in a shrimp, or a piece of cheap fish) wrapped in flabby bacon - ICKY.\nFried Gyoza/Potstickers - clearly frozen but at least edible.\nAnd one other item I forget - as I clearly did not eat it.\n\nNot a fan.\n\nGross food.",

DD had a meatball sub (my meatballs are better - these were bready and tasteless), DH had a cheesesteak which he hated and I actually like my (Kronos pre-packed, obviously frozen) Gyro sandwich on Pita.\n\nThe gents behind the counter were friendly and very nice.\nI was leaning toward 3 stars until I tasted DD's sub.  Blech!\n\nBathroom was clean and decent.\n\nThe place needs a facelift for the dining room and a re-vamp of the \"classic\" Greek-owned Pizzeria menu.\n\nI wish I could have liked it better - but we will NOT be back.",

We found yogurt that was 2 weeks past it's date.

(I mean, once you've been spoiled by Peregrine it's hard to turn back)  It's better than Charbucks - and cheaper.\n\nI have also tried the regular and white hot chocolates.  They are mixed from powders and come shooting out of a dispenser.  The white hot chocolate is like drinking a cup of sugary fat.  It's sickening.  The \"regular\" hot cocoa - while also sugar laden is at least drinkable.\n\nThe donuts are not baked on premises and thus sometimes are not too fresh.  \n\nI guess I'm just not a DD gal. America may run on Dunkin - but I'll be running away.  Oh - my 5 year old LOVES DD - especially munchkins - but she's 5 and will eat anything sweet.",

After purchasing $10.00 worth of tokens it was off to the filthy, sticky, germ-laden \"rides\" and games. \n\nI could feel myself contracting a rhinovirus by the minute.\nOh - and when I put a token in the mini carousel (my kid was the only one on it) about 5 little kids sensed \"free ride\" and pushed their way on board freaking her (and me) right out.  NO PARENTAL supervision of these kids.  Ugh.\n\nWe also played some \"ski-ball\" and then the little one fed the tickets into the \"ticket muncher\" to have them counted which took about 23 minutes.  The 103 tickets got her a cheap plastic ring, stickers and some small plastic object that I still don;t know what it is.\n\nAnd we still have about 8 tokens left over for next time.\n\nNext time?\n\nOh dear g-d please don;t make me come back here.",
