    "text": "You'd think for a place called \"Brodo\" that you'd be able to get a decent cup of soup.  Well, you'd be wrong.  I stopped in today after trying to get into Nom Nom (which was mobbed and they don't offer take out.  WTH?  But that's another review...)\n\nBrodo looks very sleek, new and nice.  Prices seem low enough - but it ends there.\nI got a 1/2 sandwich (Veggie) and a cup of soup (their version of Italian Wedding).  I asked if I could substitute cheddar for the American Cheese (which is a waste of tasteless fat/calories) and was told they only have shredded cheddar - but i could get swiss or provolone.  So I opted for no cheese.\n\nMeanhwile, I start to eat it back at the office and there is a weird horse-radish taste to the mayo.  I think they goofed and put horseradish mayo on it.  Weird - but not bad.\n\nThe soup was salt-laden and NOT even close to being delicious.\n\nNot goin' back.\nSorry.\n\nI spent $8.40 for the combo (no drink).\nOh, and the line waas not bad when I went - but if there is a long line, don't wait in it.  NOT worth it.\n\nSo sad, because it looks very nice.  I sure do miss the Naked Chocolate Cafe though.",

    "text": "Read Catherine L.'s review - and my sentiments are echoed.\n\nA close friend and I came here  for dinner.  When we had trouble finding the place (we were at the \"A Full Plate\" end of Liberties walk, we called on the phone and a nice man came out to get us and walked us over.  This, alas, was the best part of the meal.  Things got progressively worse and worse.\n\nFirst we were seated (inside - at our request) and our drink order was taken by a clearly overworked, spread-too-thin male server (who was very nice and tried his best - 3 stars for him).\n\nAfter taking our meal order we waited, and waited, and waited...\n\nAnd waited some more...\n\nAnd finally asked harried server to please bring our chips and salsa (as he had just brought some to another table nearby).  We were starvin'!\n\nThe smoky salsa and salsa verde arrive - in hot bowls \"fresh from the d/w\" and thus we had warm salsa.  Yech.  And the salty chips were \"chipettes\" (or to be mean - crumbs.)  smashed to smithereens.\n\nOK, things aren't so great - but we await our entrees.\nWow - Impressive looking - I order a single beef shortrib and feel like Fred Flintstone.  This thing is HUGE.   Gi-normous!  Like a brontosaurus rib.  Alas - there is no sauce.  My friend orders an \"OK\" pair of Chicken burritos that are no better than Qdoba.  \n\nSo here's the kicker...  About 3/4 through the entrees, frantic server appears again with a six-pack of sauce.  He gives me a bottle of HOT and a bottle of SWEET.  I pour out a bit of the sweet onto my plate (disregarding the crust around the rim of the squeez bottle) and dip my meat in.  UGH!!!  Racidity Central.\n\nThe HOT sauce is not rancid - and has a nice flavor but it just to hot for me.\n\nMy appetite is now officially GONE.\n\nAnd shortly thereafter, so were we.  I will not return.\n\nSuch a disappointment.",

Also, this is now the 2nd time the salmon tasted \"fishy\".

Water was brought instantly (YAY!) and green tea (which I had to ask for) was free.\n\nI ordered a yellowtail scallion roll (had decent yellowtail but hardly any scallion in it) and a roll with salmon and grilled onions (loaded with mayo blobs on top which I scraped off - seriously, at least 3-4 tsp. of mayo.  Eew).  It was also supposed to have masago but there was NOE in there - and when I asked the (sweet) girl about it she said they don;t include masago on the lunch special.\n\nThese people are certainly cost consious - as the lettuce & dressing salad indicated (no tomato, no nothin').\n\nI am in absolutely NO HURRY to come back here - yet - oddly enough - I ran into a friend here with another aquaintance and the LOVE it here.\n\nMeh.

Once corrected the fresh tomatoes were rotten and tasted so bad that I could not eat the salade.\n\n3.  The prices are INSANE for the quality.  My Lemon & Sugar crepe was $6.75 - which is OBSCENE.  The rotten tomato salade was $12.  That's over $20 when you add tip & tax for a salade and a dessert crepe - no beverage.\n\n4.  The restaurant was dead-empty except for our large party of 8 from when we arrived at 7:00 until after 9:30 when we left.  (This could be viewed as a pro and con in one.)  I think there is a REASON people are not coming here.\n\nYes the quality is better than \"crepe maker\" in 30th Street station - but the crepes at Profi's in Reading Terminal Market as just as good, way cheaper and (if you can deal with crowds 7 stools) possibly just as comfortable of an atmosphere.\n\nMy next stop with be Beau Monde (who's prices are even HIGHER) for true Breton crepes.  I pray I am not disappointed.\n\nSorry La Creperie, but ya let me down.\n\nSave for Christine.  She's been there 3 years - one night a week - and she is terrific.  She even adjusted my bill for the inedible salade.  (I feel so very French spelling salad with an \"e\").",

A few minutes later a man chucked a menu at me and muttered something about another person coming (no, just me) and a $15.00 minimum.\n\nI just got really turned off and walked out.  I felt bad about walking out - but he really weireded me out.\n\nSo I never got to eat here and now I know I will never go back there alone.  Maybe if a friend wants to go.  I could use some good Kalbi and Mandoo.\n\nThey treat me nicer at Miran.",

I was dragged along for a family birthday celebration - and the person who's birthday it was is on Atkins and can only eat big hunks of meat.\n\nSo here we go - we had a party of 7 - and were seated right away because we can at 4:40 PM - otherwise I can only image how long a wait would have been on a busy Saturday night.\n\nService was absolutely fine - but the ladies room was HORRIBLE.  I told a guy in the bar area about the trash on the floor and they cleaned it up right away.\n\nAs for the \"formulaic\" food - it was edible.  Not good but not inedible.\nI had a rib-eye steak (asked for it without the salt-lick seasoning they usually use - I have learned my lesson from past salt-lick-steak experiences). Added a grilled lobster tail for $11.95.  Seriously?  This this was barely 2.5 ounce.  I could have had a bunch of shrimp for a fraction of the cost.\n\nAnyhow - I also got a naked sweet potato as a side (not brown sugar - and the giant lump of butter came along side.)\n\nOur 11 year old got a salad topped with grilled shrimp (again sans seasoning - as it is just too salty for our family's tastes).  She said - and I quote she felt, \"unsatisfied\".\n\nUnsatisfied - that is just about the perfect way to describe our experience.\n\nBlargh!",

    "text": "It is tempting for me to give a scathing review and few stars to Adsum, but I will preface this review by saying that I ate at Adsum as part of a large group event with a set meal (you can't please everybody).\n\nThat said, even with the limited (and Kosher-style) menu choices, Adsum really needs to ADD SOME (Some food, maybe?) to their restaurant.\n\nI will also qualify my review by saying that the chef is very talented and was so gracious in speaking with our group.  (Why did you give a bunch of pork, clam and sausage (Lamb Merguez) based recipes to a JEWISH group??? Weird.) He really knows his stuff, though.  The service was also good (save for our new - 3 weeks only - server - who made a few bumbles along the way.)\n\nWe started with a choice of soup or salad.  I chose the 100% butter (or is it Bibb?) lettuce salad (absolutely no crunch, kinda limp feeling) with delicious asian pears and honey/cayenne candied nuts.  Crumbled of Maytag Bleu cheese on top and a delicious dressing (Sweet) with black sesame seeds. (This is where our server said they were peppercorns.  Sorry, not true.)\nThe salad - while good in concept was really boring and unsatisfying to eat.   Salade Ennuis.\n\nNow I am hungry.\n\nThe entree was sized like a large app.  3 ricotta filled \"gnuddi\" (Think Gnocchi crossed with ravioli) were delicious sitting atop a zesty lemony-cream.  But the 6 small bites (about 2 per gnocchi) were not enough.  There was also (5 star!) one - just one - fried green tomato presented with an olive oil powder on top.  I got tons of the powder, while my friend next to me had a light dusting.  I think because my tomato had so much powder I could detect a slight \"chemical aftertaste\" from it.  (The \"top note - was great - a dry, green olive oil.)\n\nI would have bet money that somehow liquid nitrogen was involved. I'd have lost money.  They make the Olive oil powder by centrifuging the Olive oil with a malto-dexttin aggregate or something. Maybe that accounts for the chemical aftertaste?\n\nI am getting over the whole \"molecular gastronomy\" fad very quickly.\nI am also not a big lover of sous-vide (so much of it is done poorly), but that is the subject for another review.\n\nThe other entree choice was a single (JUST ONE) deep-fried cod fritter.  Not my bag, baby.\n\nDelicious gnuddi - just not enough food.\n\nNow I am STARVING...\n\nSo dessert comes, and it is GINORMOUS.  (Nice salad, tiny entree, huge hunk of chocolate cake) and so dense and cold and rich you can barely eat it with a spoon. My friend wanted a knife - as did I.)\n\nSo I ate 2 bites of the chocolate cake, and felt my blood sugar spike almost instantly.\n\nNot fun.  I boxed up the rest for my 6 year old to enjoy later.\n\nFor $46 per person??  I guess that's fair - if you had eaten an actual entree. (Salad, app, huge dessert.)\n\nI literally had to eat a bowl of strawberries at 11:30 PM when I got home. I hate eating late at night but I was absolutely famished.\n\nI am very, very disappointed with Adsum.\nThat said - the regular menu (Foie gras poutine?  The SUPER Poutine is like a platter of pure fat in many forms.) doesn't really do it for me either.\n\nSorry Adsum.\n\nFAIL. The 3 stars is so you won't hate me.  I am so tempted to give only 2.",

Well, sometimes you get what you pay for...\n\nIn this case my experience sucked before it even began.  In the parking lot.  I walked up to get a cart and you need to put a Quarter in to release a cart.  Feh.  I had no quarters.  So I figured I'd \"wing it\" and only buy what I could carry (which was about  5 items). There are no shopping baskets inside the store, either.  What is this? Grays Ferry?\n\nSo I browse and I shop, and yes the prices are super low, but - BUT - no-name brands or brands I have NEVER heard of and no sourcing info.  (Fresh grated Parmesan-type cheese for $1.99 - distributed by ALDI in IL but WHERE is it from?  US?  Italy (no way)?)  Too scared to buy meat here. Bought my kid a cookies & cream type candy bar from Germany (interesting).\n\nI approach the checkout line and there is ONE lady working (everyone else has scattered) who desperately wants to go on break.  The lady ahead of me is being served and I remarked (out loud - my BIG mistake) Oh, they have no plastic bags?  And the eco-conscious lady ahead of me gave me a HUGE earful about how all stores should do this and how \"You need to bring your own bags\" and how it's better for the environment and on and on.  And, honestly, she is correct - but her snappy, bitchy-toned delivery needed much improvement.\n\nShe left and I paid for my $11 worth of stuff (which would have cost about $15 at Giant) and hand-carried it out to my car.  (Admittedly, I looked around in the parking lot to make sure that lady was gone.  She was really pissed off for some reason.) \n\nNext time I will remember to bring a quarter and my own bags.\n\nIf there is a next time.\n\nI am in absolutely no rush to ever return to ALDI.",

Frankly, I can't believe they are still here.  \n\nBut yes, you can stock up on toys and party favors here - and other \"naughty bits\".\n\nAnd yes, it is in the BASEMENT - and theirs just something psychological for me about going DOWN into a sex shop.  (Ba dum, bump!)",

    "text": "Pretty darned awful.  We were cajoled into coming here by our 5 year old after dining at the illiustrious IHOP next door.  After purchasing $10.00 worth of tokens it was off to the filthy, sticky, germ-laden \"rides\" and games. \n\nI could feel myself contracting a rhinovirus by the minute.\nOh - and when I put a token in the mini carousel (my kid was the only one on it) about 5 little kids sensed \"free ride\" and pushed their way on board freaking her (and me) right out.  NO PARENTAL supervision of these kids.  Ugh.\n\nWe also played some \"ski-ball\" and then the little one fed the tickets into the \"ticket muncher\" to have them counted which took about 23 minutes.  The 103 tickets got her a cheap plastic ring, stickers and some small plastic object that I still don;t know what it is.\n\nAnd we still have about 8 tokens left over for next time.\n\nNext time?\n\nOh dear g-d please don;t make me come back here.",

    "text": "We were greeted in a very friendly manner and offered free chocolates.  After being seated though, we just had to leave.  This is not an appropriate venue for a business lunch.  Loud, distracting decor and a predominantly chocolate menu made it hard to choose from the over priced snacky-type lunch menu.\n\nSave this place for a date or (if you're rich) bring the kids who are sure to be entertained here.\n\nThis place will fail if they don;t offer some sensible lunch choices (Salads were $13.95) or lunch specials.",
