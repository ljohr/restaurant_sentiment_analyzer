    "text": "Wow - I coulda sworn i reviewed Susanna Foo a looooong time ago, but I guess not.  Anyhow - went there again (3rd time) last night and sat putside - which I usually never do.  It was a surprising lovely evening.  I had been here twice before for lunch - which was good but maybe only 3 or 4 stars.  \n\nLast nite's meal solidified the 4 stars.  Service was wonderful and attentive (maybe because they are slow in the summer??).  We stated with virgin Golden Pineapple Mojitos which were truly delish.  FRESH pineapple juice and mint - perfectly balanced.\n\nMy dining companion was a close friend from out of town who walked by and wanted to go here.  She is very health conscious and ordered the salmon in a light (not too salty) black bean sauce over a crsip tender bed of TERRIFIC baby bok choi.  It was accompanied by a Cocunt \"polenta\" that was so silken it tased and felt like coconut flan.  Almost dessert like.\n\nI had a started of an Ahi Tuna Sampler (which I have ordered before and I just love it.).  At $17 it is small and expensive - but the quality of the tuna tartare and the fabulous accompaniments make it somehow worth every delicious teeny morsel.\n\nInstead of an entree I had the COMPOSED  $12 salad with golden beets, candied Walnuts, sliced yellow tomatoes, microgreens in a delectable, sweet but not cloying , light vinagrette.  The salad came with 5 small goat-cheese wontons - that looked like over-stuffed tortellni.\n\nI ate 3 and gave 2 to my partner.  They really didn't do much for me.  The goat cheese inside was almost like a bleu?  Goat gorgonzola maybe?  Too strong.\n\nBut the salad and all the other compnents was terrific.\n\nIf you think Foo is past her prime or somehow not \"all that\" anymore - I urge you to give it another try.  At dinner.  (It was way better than the 2 lunches I had previously.)",

It's homey vibe and decidedly 2-3 star service (not bad - but weird service - a bit inattentive and spacey - hard to get a check - hard to ask questions) knock me down to a solid 4 stars.\n\nBright, homey decor and even the bathrooms feel clean and light.  Owner is very nice and has gorgeous eyes.  (Waiter was pretty hot, too.)\n\nMy good (lacto-ovo-vegetarian) friend and I had a delicious lunch there today.  I have 2 yummy glasses of the Lemonada (1/2 mint iced tea mixed with 1/2 lemonade - the PERFECT summer refresher.  My friend had Greek Coffee - made the traditional way.\n\nFor our lunch he had Shouksouka (delicious) - great for a breakfast or brunch, too.  Very rich and filling.  I had the Kanella platter and for $12 it was the perfect way to sample alot of offerings.  For me the best part were the Dolmades (stuffed grape leaves).  Now, I realize that everybody and everybody's grandma makes 'em dirrefently and Kanella's are distinctively sweet with currants and luscious Pine Nuts.  The falafel, Zucchinni fritter and yogurt were all good too.  The only thing I could not eat was the spicy tomato salad (next time I will order it made mild - if they can do that).  It was soooooo peppery with a \"harrissa-like\" taste to it.\n\nBaklava was served with syrupy orange slices and was chock-full-o-nuts.  Very good for $3.50!\n\nWe plan to return.  But - please - beef uf your staff and service.",

    "text": "I returned to Kanella last night with a good friend and we had a lovely evening.  We shared everything.\n\nWe started with the Horiatiki Salad - chopped tomatoes, cucumber, radishes, red onions, parsley and a PERFECTLY light olive oil vinaigrette that literally \"sang\" in the mouth.  Just the right amount of salt & pepper - fresh, balanced, crisp and light for summer.\n\nWe them shared the Boureka (Phyllo pastry stuffed with savory cheese) topped with a drizzle of sweet, floral honey.  The sweet 'n savory combo was perfectly showcased by the beet salad (fresh, red beet chunks and herbs) along side.  It was like dessert for an app.  Swwet and luscious.\n\nThing just got better & better.\n\nJohn, our server brought the main entree ($28) a Whole Dorrado fileted tableside (albeit a bit clumsily).  Wrapped in Grapeleaves, drizzled with a fruity Olive Oil and lemon, it was cooked perfectly and we each ate every last bit.  (My friend did discover a few scales on her fish - but I did not.)\n\nEqually wonderful was the side of steaming-hot kale, tomato and onion.  That is just my kinda food!\n\nWe shared a dessert sampler (Small $8, Large would have been $12) which came with nutty, crispy baklava, a honey-drenched semolina cake (reminiscent of my Aunt's honey cake).  Both great.  It also came with a shortbread stuffed with a date paste - not so great.\n\nBut most facinating perhaps, was the center piece on the dessert plate - a whole blanched fig that we still can't quite figure out how it was prepared.  But, boy was it tasty.  I love fresh figs.\n\nI wish they would add a fresh fig plate or a fruit plate of some sort to the summer desserts.\n\nWe brought our own Prosecco, beer & cider and had a lovely summer evening meal.\n\nSUPER!  A hair's bredth away from 5 stars - but certain aspects of service and prep are still 4 star.\n\nKanella is a place to try - and re-visit.  They are on the move - and it's all delish!",

I ordered the sushi/sashimi \"pick 3\" - and had Salmon sashimi (very good), Yellowtail nigiri (Good - but not orgasmic) and Ikura.\n\nI am VERY picky about Ikura (- it has to be \"poppin' fresh) and this was very, very fresh and good. BUT - I get the feeling not too many people order it.\n\nI also reprised the fair Eggplant Lady (appetixer) and she deserves a starring role.  Jay accomodated me with very light on the sauce (both in the shrimp mixture and on top) and 2 lusciously crispy eggplant slices.\n\nIt was raining so the place was not crowded, but the delivery was HOPPIN'. (Yes, they deliver, thank goodness!)\n\nAlso Jay showed me several goreous salt-molds he makes to serve on the sushi platters.  (Kinda like ice sculpture - but made with molded salt.)\n\nMartin was there, too.\n\nNice guys at the bar.\n\nI can't wait to take my 5 year old and husband here.  They will love it.\n\nOh - and did I mention the pick 3 sahimi/sushi was $8.50?  What a deal - the items I ordered would have cost $15 a la carte!",

    "text": "OK, the hot Aussie bartender is still there (Big plus.) but a few things have changed.  3 of us had dinner at Xochitl on sunday night.\nWe were made to wait until about 7:20 (at the crowded bar) for our 7 PM reservation.  Not a huge deal, since I was intent on ordering Dona Florindas.\n\nWell, they changed the way they make them and now they use apricot infused tequila instead of pineapple infused tquila - but hot bartender made me one old school.  TERRIFIC.\n\nThe 3 of us each ordered the Sunday Special - 3 courses plus Guac for the table for $35.00.  It was a ton of food - and a good value.\n\nThe table-side guac was top of the line, as usual.  So delicious.  Once we ate it and had our apps (I had a fresh and sublime shrimp cocktail with jicama and mango) we were too full for the entrees.  I enjoyed my skirt steak with unique \"Avocado fries\".  My friend special ordered a mixed grill and did not like it.  I felt bad for her.\n\nMeanwhile, DH had the pork and enjoyed it.  I never eat pork, but it looked well prepared.\n\nSince I was so full - I ate about 3 bites (yummy, tender, succulent bites) of the steak and had it boxed to go.  We still had dessert coming and I was jonsin' for churros.  Well, they came out burnt.  Such a shame - as we had eaten them twice before.  DH had the chocolate cake which was rich and delectable and came with a Cajeta ice cream.\n\nAll 3 of us had the Mexican Hot chocolate - and I like Xochitl's version even  better than the Aztec one at the Naked Chocolate Cafe.  (Nakeds is too spicey for me.)\n\nSo it wasn't quite the 5 star experience that we had on the 2 prior visits - but it was still very, very good.  It just kinda feels like (maybe its the economy, maybe it's just a factor of restaurant age) service and food quality are slipping a little.\n\nDon't get sloppy, Xochitl.  We're counting on you for a 5 star visit when we return.\n\nAnd I will return (not sure about my friend though.).",

I ordered the sushi/sashimi \"pick 3\" - and had Salmon sashimi (very good), Yellowtail nigiri (Good - but not orgasmic) and Ikura.\n\nI am VERY picky about Ikura (- it has to be \"poppin' fresh) and this was very, very fresh and good. BUT - I get the feeling not too many people order it.\n\nI also reprised the fair Eggplant Lady (appetixer) and she deserves a starring role.  Jay accomodated me with very light on the sauce (both in the shrimp mixture and on top) and 2 lusciously crispy eggplant slices.\n\nIt was raining so the place was not crowded, but the delivery was HOPPIN'. (Yes, they deliver, thank goodness!)\n\nAlso Jay showed me several goreous salt-molds he makes to serve on the sushi platters.  (Kinda like ice sculpture - but made with molded salt.)\n\nMartin was there, too.\n\nNice guys at the bar.\n\nI can't wait to take my 5 year old and husband here.  They will love it.\n\nOh - and did I mention the pick 3 sahimi/sushi was $8.50?  What a deal - the items I ordered would have cost $15 a la carte!",

Seriously - great, great service.\n\nThe food - as always - is solid but mabe just a few tweaks could up the game even more.

They have the BEST doctors in the UNIVERSE who are specifically trained in rare illnesses and conditions of children.\n\nI pray we don't have to go here often - but we already have had one harrowing experience which involved taking our daughter (then 4) to the CHOP ER after she fell from a shopping cart in Superfresh.  She was bleeding from her nose - but did not hit her head.\n\nWE were seen in triage within 3 minutes and then waiting about 10 minutes to be put into an ER room.  Then the real waiting began.  The Nurse saw us right away - but we had to wait 40 minutes to see the doctor.  By then the bleeding had stopped and she was pronounced OK - and she was acting her \"normal\" self again.\n\nMeanwhile we REALLY had to wait for the billing information to be processed.  That was a drag because now it was after 10 PM   (we arrived at 7:30 or so initially) and our tuckered out 4 yo just wanted to go home.  (and so did we.) \n\nAnd they spelled her name wrong - more waiting to correct that.\n\nSo 5 stars for great doctors and state-of-the art facilities (the give you a pager prior to triage) and 2-3 for lousy administrative skills.",

Many of the crazy (and a bit over-sauced - get your sauce on the side - problem solved), calorie-laden specialty rolls are just like Vic's but sub lobster for crab and have different names.\n\nMy first visit (a few minutes ago) I ordered 2 things - tuna dumplings (divine) - and the eggplant lady.\n\nBoth are apps. - but that was just perfect for little ole me.\n\nThe $7.50 order of 2 hand-flattened tuna pouches came bursting with a slightly sweet, slightly spicy mixture of lobster (real) and crab (fake) salad with masago and avocado.  Creamy, fattening, non-traditional goodness.\n\nThe $4.25 eggplant lady (I will re-order this for sure) had 2crispy-thin tempura slices of purple japanese eggplant.  The eggplant was luscious, crisp slice was topped with chopped shrimp and (fake) crab salad (more avocado, masago, kewpie - like my hips needed THAT!), topped with sliver-sliced avo and eel sauce.\n\n(Next time - no sauce.)\n\nThis is NOT a place to get traditional nigiri.  (The tamago is frozen, and there's no way that Inari is home made)  It is a place for \"fun-food\" rolls as a treat.  Purists won't like it, but Phat-Philly types should LOVE it here.\n\nThe service was Excellent - but Jay is new and eager to please.  I anticipate visiting againsoon - and I'd bet money on it that the 6-seat sushi bar (and tables for about 14 more - It's bigger than Vic's - andthey actually serve you your drinks) will be MUCH more crowded.\n\nSo in summary:  Sushi-newbie?  Great place for you.  Fresh-fish, sashimi purist?  Probably not.\n\nFor me - there is a time and place for everything.  Tonight was my time for the 2 month old Jay's.\n\nI sure hope the quality doesn't deteriorate in 6 months.",

    "text": "A strong 4 stars for Village Whiskey from me!\nA good friend and fellow yelper squeaked into the bar at around 8:45 PM on a snowy Tuesday.  There just happened to be 2 great seats waiting for us.  (I don't know if this place is worth a long wait)\n\nService from Sasha was excellent and she is so friendly and helpful.\nWe started off with an order of fried pickles and shared the DELICIOUS pickled artichokes.  (These are the best thing I tasted that night and worth a re-order)\n\nMy companion had a delectable veggie burger topped with a fried egg (Wowza!) and guacamole.  The lady next to us had a beef burger topped with an egg as well and they sure know how to fry an egg here!\n(Incidentally the couple next to us also shared the duckfat fries topped with shortribs and cheese sauce - looked so heavy - like a heart attach on a plate.  I bet it ROCKED!\n\nAnyhow, we continued with an order of \"tater tots' that were so rrefined they'd put Ore-Ida to shame.\n\nAnd an order of pickled golden and red beets that I wound up barely touching and had packed up to go.\n\nThe best thing to me?  The delicious lemon oil-scented whipped ricotta that accompaied the pickled dishes.  Also a tasty tapenade and fresh, thin slices of baguette.  Nice!\n\nI will definitely come back here.\n\nWhat a cute (albeit small) \"retro\" feeling place.",

    "text": "Even with the mixed reviews I had been wanting to try Spasso for over a year.\nLast night - a slow-as-heck Monday night was the night to do it.\n\nWhile this may be a truly 3 star place, I am giving them a 4 for the excellent service we got (along with $4 cape-codders) at the bar.  The caprese salad was not the best - it was served with iceberg lettuce (who does that??) and was swimming in low-grade olive oil. For $5 on happy hour it was fine.  Normally it's $8.50 and I would not order it again. (Which is a shame because I love a good caprese.)\nBartender was cute and very personable also.\n\nDinner was better - we were seated right away (dining room was only about 1/4 full) and our (young, pretty) server was perfectly fine.\n\nFood was actually great - veal with spinach and crab-meat served with al dente fettuccine.  Large portion so I took 1/2 home.  My friend had veal parm - which looked average.  (Veal was deep fried underneath the sauce and cheese. Chocolate mousse cake was OK for dessert but the cappuccino was Excellent.\n\nI can certainly understand why some don't like it here as there are many unprofessional chinks in the Spasso armor.  The dining room below the chair rail MUST be re-painted.  It is a deep brown color and everywhere a chair has bumped there is a white chip out of the paint (looks bad).  Also the female servers and hostesses tend to collect in a gaggle at the hostess stand or by the kitchen and chat (they were bored and it was slow ) - or out back for a smoke.\n\nNot truly a 4 star place - morel like 3, 3.5 but we had a great night and I am feeling generous.\n\nI'll be back for happy hour for sure.",

I am so happy they now have a Mexican option in the Comcast Center.  \n\nWhile I am not a huge fan of the sit-down branches of Mexican Post (we have often been to the Cherry street location, which is near our home.), the Express offers a less expensive option and is great for lunch.\n\nThey also participated in the Yelp Spring Festival and had muy delicioso Spinach Flauta.  I hope they'll add it to their every day menu.  (But somehow I doubt that.)\n\nSo, muchas gracias to Mexican Post Express for offering the hungry lunch crowd a quick and tasty burrito, taco or enchilada.",

    "text": "Oh, this is a conflicted 4 star review - and brace yourself - it may be a long one.  My husband and a close (vegetarian) friend of ours finally took the plunge and went to Chifa for dinner on Halloween night.\n\nDecor is 5 star - and gorgeous.  Everything from the restroom to the blue & white tiles on the walls, and tons of flickering votive candles at night.\n\nI do have to say that the service was EXCELLENT - from the hostess and our server, Melissa, right down to the ceviche chef.  Everyone was friendly and accomodating to our various requests and questions.\n\nFrom reading these reviews, I am sure by now you know that Chifa serves small plates (perfect for sharing) and that some are smaller than others.  You may also have read about the hot, cheesey bread balls served with a spicy guava butter.  They are, indeed, AWESOME and I scarfed down 2 of them without even realizing it.\n\nWe started our meal with a round of delicious - if overpriced ($12 a pop) - cocktails.  The guys had glorified Shandies - Ginger liqueur, fresh lime juice and beer.  I had a virgin Pineapple Ginger concoction that was made w/ REAL, fresh golden pineapple.  It was so tasty & refreshing.\n\nThen came the famous buns.  The BBQ tofu bun (we subbed tofu for pork belly) was so terrific - possibly the best bite of the night.  The tofu was crisp and blissfully glazed in a hoisin BBQ sauce.  A dash of spicy mayo on the white steamed bun.  Yum.  The Pork belly was (likely sous-vided - they have gone sous-vide CRAZY here.) very fatty - but hey - it's pork BELLY.  Belly as alot of fat, right?  Well, I preferred the tofu.\n\nAnyhow - we progress onward - out came the egg mcmuffins - no really, I can't remember the name, but they were corn arepas topped with Oxtail, a PERFETLY done egg (a bit runny but not slimy), crisp bacon and (here's where Chifa loses major points) tons of gloppy peppery sauce.  Thankfully, and thanks to YELP, I knew to order my food with \"sauce on the side\" or \"Light on the sauce\" - and this was my mantra for the evening.\n\nMy veggie friend had the Chinese Broccoli, and as others have said, it was way too oily.  Literally swimming in a sesame oil sauce.    He also had a vegetarian version of the Chaufa rice.  I tasted a bite and it was complex and delicious - if a little heavy on the (surprise) salt.\n\nYes, folks, it's true.  Chifa has potential to be a real, true 5 star joint, but they are too heavy handed with the salt, oily, sauces and seasonings.  The ingredients they use are top-quality and need to be able to \"sing\" for themselves.  I am not saying to under season them, just please don't OVER season them.\n\nNext came the (much, much anticipated) Lobster noodles.  I knew to ask for this \"light on the sauce\" and it was still swimming in a rich, creamy, slightly red-peppery sauce.  Succulent and buttery-sweet hunks of lobster and fresh, green peas.  The noodles were perfectly cooked.  I would totally order this again (and the tofu buns, man they rocked).  But next time I'd go even LIGHTER on the sauce - I can't imagine how over-sauced it would have been had I not asked for light sauce.  \n\nOk.  Whatever.  You get the point.\n\nAnyhow - we're not done (Oh, and by now I CANCELLED our order of $38 wagyu steak - as I knew I'd be too full to eat it.) - Out came the curried goat (get it  for one - it's more than enough).  This is a unique dish - and not my fave - but hubby liked it.  Served with freshly sliced bananas and more of those light fluffy buns along side.  Plus a weird crispy lentil cake.\n\nAnd next came the (yes, they are greasy) scallion pancakes.  Not the best I've ever had - but the cauliflower sauce (yes, really) was super tasty.\n\nOh - and Chifa is really weird about \"coursing out\" the meals - the served us a single bowl of broccolli after the buns and before anything else.  If we return, I will try to tell them what we want first (Like, the Waygu!!!)\n\nBy now we are all pretty stuffed, but we just had to have some Chai tea and Banana-Pumpkin funnel cake (too greasy for me - but somehow, I ate it!  Ha!).  The banana ice cream quenelle along side it was home made and PERFECT.   The odd honey-anise tuile?  Not so hot.  Thankfully, once again, I asked for the strange spicy peanut sauce ON THE SIDE.\n\nGarces must be commended for his creative menu, but I fear there is just a little TOO MUCH going on in each dish.  Too much salt, too much sauce, too much fat, etc.\n\nAlso they sure are getting full usage out of their brand new sous-vide machine.  Nearly all the meats are sous-vided (and yes, they are tender to a fault) - but what about some good ole pan-searing?\n\nOK, I am a spoiled, jaded, ex-Manhattan brat - but I really did enjoy our 2.5 hour meal here and WOULD return - especially now that I know what to get and what NOT to get.\n\nChifa, you are sooooo close to 5 star - but some of the dishes were really 2-3 star.  (Brocolli, Scallion pancakes, Desserts need work.)\n\nWe'll drop in for buns 'n beer",

It was tasty - but I detected little to no truffle - I was like dipping in pure sour cream.  OK - but just OK.  (Fat City!)\n\nA few people ordered some small plates of food and everything looked nice, but I did not try any.\n\nPearl (now AKOYA) has re-vamped its look to be more of a club/bar and less of a fine dining place.\n\nMany of the menu items remain, but the menu is more streamlined and focuses on muchies with an Asian flair.\n\nNot bad.  \n\nOh - and the bartender was a hottie and VERY attentive to all of us.

The owner, Chris, is terrific and the Duck Deli catered a \"Backyard BBQ Bash\" I threw for my husband's surprise 30th birthday in 2007.\n\nThe mac 'n cheese, pulled Pork, Beef Brisket and smoked BBQ chicken are terrific.

It was lightly and PERFECTLY dressed with a basil infused oil and a sweet balsamic (decent quality - not the cheap stuff, but not the 17 year old either).  It sang on the palate.\n\nI am hankeing to try the meatball and risotto app - next time.   (And there WILL be a next time.)\n\nNext we split a pizza.  Let me preface this by saying that I am not (shocking, I know) a pizza lover.  I am a pasta lover, but never really \"get off\" on pizza.  \n\nStella's pizza is very, very good.  (My friend says it's better than Osteria - but the pie she had as Osteria was burnt.)  Thin crust - but not ridiculously thin.  (I dislike \"pizza on a cracker\")  Thin in the middle and medium rise (with some puffiness) on the edges.  We had #11 - Spinach.  It was a white pie with a healthy hit of garlic, toasted pine nuts (Oh, yeah, baby!!), the ideal amount of fresh, bright green, sauteed spinach, and a few heavy handed spinkles (globs?) of a sundried tomato/oil puree.  Definitely tasty - and worth a try for those of you who like spinach.\n\nOne negative?  No substitutions on pie.  They make 'em how they make 'em.\n\nOne positive?  GREAT service by our your server (can not remember her name - but she was really nice and attentive.)\n\nAnother thing... only gelatos for dessert.  We skipped dessert here and opted to get some home-made cakes at \"More than Just Ice Cream\".  But I bet their gelato is good.  (However, Capogiro is not too far, ya know...)\n\nAnyhow - Starr strikes again with a good (and not overly decorated - thank goodnees) spot.\n\nNote to the hard-working pie men (and gals):  Please keep the pies crispy on the bottom - nobody likes a soggy pie.\n\nJOB WELL DONE.\n\nOh - another thing - we really wish you'd take reservations.  Thankfully at 5:30 on a May Sunday we (2 people) did not need one and were seated quickly.  Hooray!",

The salt crystals are nice.\n\nThey also have a real Rassul (mud) room and a Steamed Hay treatment (not my thing).\n\nFor an everyday massage - I would not waste the money here - it is soooooo expensive, but for aspecial treat - or a party with friends (that Brine room can seat 6 people easily) it's fine.\n\nThey also throw in a complimentary foot soak (lavender or peppermint in a copper bowl of water.

I had the short rib torta and it was BIG (Huge, and messy - definitely NOT a date night food.), but more importantly it was Excellente!\n\nThe braised beef shortrib was tender, yet charred (they do this at the end for presentation) and tasted so flavorful and succulent with just the right amout of fat to taste great but not too fatty.\n\nThe sauce - made of guajillo (sp??) peppers and tomato, really tasted like tomato sauce to me - but what do I know?  The best part?  A FRESH - I mean uber-fresh - baked roll - almost like a mexican \"fat\" baquette with a crunchy crust and a white, airy inside.  (Yes, I know trop carbs, but who cares when the Bread is shipped in from Parc!!!)\n\nThey even re-did the back bar as a swanky faux speak-easy.\n\nYes, it's pricey - but I bet if you order the right things you can have a 4 star night easily at El Rey.\n\nOh - and even though the place is blaringly-loud - it's still less noisy than Distrito - but I gotta say - Distrito's food still ROCKS my world.\n\nI shall return.

The signature app. - thinly sliced smoked salmon wrapped around a panko-crusted poached egg topped with a razor-thin crispy potato \"chip\", microgreens in a tangy vanaigrette and a bitt of maldon salt.  WOW.  (And for $14 it better be!).\n\nDH had the pork belly with came with a delicious jus and a golden raisin puree (which on paper grosses me out - but actually tasted ok.) and topped with a quarter-sized \"slice\" of mustard gelee (eew. sorry - gelee is also not a big hit for me.)\n\nDH also had the trout entree which was perfection on a plate - sided with creamy pureed cauliflower.  I opted for foie gras app in lieu of an entree - which made me feel like I needed gall bladder surgery.  Wow - so fattening - I literally only ate half. (It was a scoop of foie with a \"liquid center\" of cherries.)  The brioche toast to spread it on was heavenly as well.\n\nAfter all that fat we just couldn't handle dessert - but the table behind us had fresh begneits which looked amazing.\n\nWe brought our own wine and the bill was still nearly $100 (and I had 2 apps - no entree).  Wow that's kinda steep for a BYO.\n\nService was top-notch - especially Jackie our server who catered to our every whim.\n\nA few things make it so I just can't give them 5 stars - namely the price for what you get.\n\nThey have Manhattan prices in Coshohocken. Imagine!\nMeanwhile the place was packed, and the decor and service are great - if you can handle the crowded digs and the noise.\n\nI would definitely go back, but I would not RUSH back.  \nIt is worth ONE trip out from Center City to see if you like it.\nAfter that - judge for yourself.\n\nOh - and they cater - but man am I scared to imagine that bill.",

Now they are just a few doors down Main where the old Fagin & Fagin grocery store (now THAT's a blast from the past) used to be.\n\nHerb's is a D-town instituion and a great go-to spot for crafters who don't feel like driving out to AC Moore or Michaels.  They have all sorts of crating supplies, balsa wood, glue, floral arranging supllies, DIY kits - you name it.\n\nWhen I was 8-11 this place was like wonderland.\n\nGlad they're still around.",

The pale green avo-jalapeno crema was terrific over top of it.  Rich and decadent.\n\nSo close to 5 stars - why not?  Hubby did not care for the braised beef enchiladas - he said the shortribs last time were better.

For me and 2 other to go up and back to NYC was under $60.00.  The tickets ranged from $7 to $13 one way.  I did not get the $1 fare yet.\n\nAlso - there is a 50 cent surcharge for each transaction - so kep that in mind when you book.\n\nI am kinda hoping this stays a secret because the busses are getting more & more crowded each time we go.\n\nI also agree that the seats are very stiff and not comfy - but the busses are new and CLEAN (not like Chinatown hell, I mean, bus).  I did not use the wifi - but others did.  There are plenty of outlets (pugs) and also sometimes they'll play a movie.\n\nMUCH cheaper than Amtrak.

I had a Cucumber Gin/White Cranberry concoction and it was refreshing and enjoyable.\n\nThe food was just OK.\nThe highlight for me were the $4.75 brussels sprouts - I got them sans bacon and they were perfectly roasted and wonderful.  \n\nThe salad I chose was where things fell short.  I ordered the heirloom tomato and mozzarella salad (a dish I have had at many places, prepared in many different ways).  The \"herb crust\" on the mozz just ruined it.  (And I could tell is was good, quality mozz underneath.)  Also the tomatoes.  The small, mulit-colored tomoatoes were fine - but the thickly sliced green tomato (the \"meat\" of the dish\") was over ripe and mushy.\n\nIck.\n\nMy friend got (what I was thinking of getting and should have gotten) the veggie sampler for $15.50.  Next time (if it is still available) I will get that.

We made due a few feet apart.\n\nAlso the new male server is a little abrasive.  It's \"his way or the highway\".  I kinda miss the nice ladies at lunch time - but I guess they no longer work the dinner shift.\n\nAlso - do NOT come here for Dining Under the Stars (aka Chaos out in the Heat).  Service is way, way slow - and we know they are doing their best - but it's not working.  Demand is too high for supply.\n\nRan out of chips, ran out of mild salsa (made more).  \n\nIn the mean time, the pitchers of Mango and Lemon/Lime margarita mix are terrific and after a few shots of tequila none of us cared.\n\nFood was excellent - Chicken Enchiladas, Veggie Enchiladas, Fish Tacos and of course the AMAZING surf & turf fajitas.\n\nOne more small gripe:  We were changed a $2.95 sharing charge, but the platter was not split for us.  Basically we were charged for the server to give us 2 bread plates.  Wha?????  I don't mind paying a small sharing charge if it means the platter will, indeed, be split to share.  Ours wasn't.\n\nSorry to come off harshly - we still love you guys - but there are some areas for improvement.\n\nLunch?  Come here.\nDinner (not on a Wednesday)?  Come here.\nCatering?  Come here.\nLarge Group?  Don't come here.\nDining out in the Chaos?  Do NOT come here.",

    "text": "Well, my husband & I finally tried this place - we've driven by a bunch of times but never went.  And we would consider returning (although Shiroi Hana is more convenient for us - and lately I've been really into Vic's.)\n\nThe place was nearly empty at 5:30 on a Friday.  The hostess asked if we had a reservation and we told her that we did not.  She made a negative face so I asked her if that was a problem (The place was empty except for one male couple lingering - and they were there before we got there AND after we left.).  She said no and seated us.\n\nI stopped by the sushi bar to bow to the chef and take a peek at the fish.  Looked good.  Chef recommended the Red Snapper and O-Toro.  \n\nWe started with an order ($3.00) of Pork Wasabi Shumai.  - 2 large shumai.  Tasty and very wasabi-ish.\n\nMy husband ordered a bowl of udon (very tasty dashi broth) a spicy tuna roll which he loved, and a negi-hamachi roll which was just OK.\n\nI got a special roll (Jay roll?) with rice \"pops\" on it - good but I did not care for the spicye-level of the tuna filling.  It was too hot for me.  (And I had asked for it mild.)  I bet if you are a spicy lover you'd like the rolls here.\n\nTuna was fresh - but not the yellowtail.  Also my $6.00 piece of O-Toro was gristley and GROSS.  What a shame.  Toro should be a mouth-gasm and this was not.\n\nThe best sushi I got was the Inari stuffed with chopped tuna (spicy tuna - this time WAS made mild) and garnished with chunks of avocado and a few pine nuts.  The pine nuts really made it so special.  I would DEFINITELY get that again.\n\nFor dessert we had the green-tea icecrem filled mochi which was very good.\n\nOh - and they do NOT make their own tamago - it's frozen - so we did not order any.",

I savored a delectable negi-hamachi hand roll, a salmon lover's roll (very good but a bit steep at $13.50), a succulent solitary piece of (of all things) foie gras nigiri (Yum and fat-city), 2 HOUSE_MAD tamago sashimi (excellent).\n\nThe only negative?  The ikura sushi piece was not quite as \"poppin' fresh\" as i would have liked.\n\nMeanwhile - Yama makes his OWN inari (what a rarity that can be in the sushi world).  And at $7.00 a pop, I think I will wait till next time to try the Chu-toro (which I actually prefer to the fattier and pricier O-toro).\n\nMy faith has been restored.  I disagree with Victoria - the fish was all fresh (save for the ikura which was fresh but not \"peak\").  Service was very nice,and i can't wait to return.\n\nDinner for one (just me - no beverages) was $45 including tip.",

My dish (at least to me) was the best - a special of Langostino, split and grilled and sauced with a yummy tequila, garlic and pepper sauce.  Flavorful - but not too hot & spicey.\n\nTequila's makes one of the BEST Caesar salads EVER,  It can run heavy on the dressing, so i always ask for it lightly dressed and last night's was up to par and delicious.\n\nOur female server (her name escapes me) was lovely and attentive.\n\nThe BEST 5 star part of the meal was the Tres Leche cake (which the 3 of us split - we were stuffed).\n\nThe worst - which made me downgrade from 5 to 4 stars - was the queso fundito.  Just tooo heavy and greasy.  A big crock of melted cheese.  (I didn't order it - I never would have in a million years.)\n\nBring back the FRESH lime margaritas and I'll quickly re-up you to 5 stars.  Tequila's is a great restaurant.  I recommend it to out of town guests often.\n\nOh - and please start taking reservations.  (Right now they'll only reserve for parties of 6 or more.)",

We will definitely come back one more time - soon - to see the rest.\n\nWe straight away headed to the submarine (creepy & cramped) and ship that are docked nearby.  This took about 35 minutes.\n\nThen we started in on the exhibits - and did not get all the way through.  We spent a long time in the boat shop.  I had no idea they actually build, replicate and restore boats for museums all over the east coast.  While we were there, one of the head builders stopped sanding long enough to tell us about a design they are working on for the Seaport Museum at Mystic, CT.  Neat-o!!!\n\nThe lights were dimmed at 4:45 - so we headed to the gift shop.  Whew - narrowly escaped that one.\n\nWe'll be back soon.  I enjoyed this a heck of alot more than I thought I would - on the surface it seems like a real snooze fest.  But with the 6 year old in tow - it was much better.\n\nOh and it was great to come on a random Monday in April than say - July 4th when tourist central swoops in.",

The owner is the cousin of the man who owned Pamir (which, alas, has since closed in NYC.).\n\nThe menus are nearly identical and oh, how I love the fried pumpkin turnovers (Buranee Kadu).  In fact, anything with pumpkin is a yummy choice here.  The service is good - very friendly but they can seem aloof - so if you WANT more water/sauce/napkins - you need to be pro-active (some may see this as a bad thing.).\n\nIt was also a great place to have an un-crowded experience.  The place is rarely crowded.  (Possibly because it is a bit old and grungy looking.)  Don't let the crummy decor dissueade you - TRY THE FOOD - terrifc Chalau (stews) and Pallaus (Pilafs/Rice dishes).\n\nI love Afghan food and I love the food at Kabul.\nAnd it is a GREAT value for very little money.\n\nMaybe they'll re-decorate some day?

Monsu is BYOB, so we brought many bottles of wine - red, white and otherwise.\n\nAppetizers were brought by our terrific wait staff, including mussels in a spicy tomato, oregano and white wine broth. Next, came octopus (Polpo) salad with green olives and crunchy wild fennel.  Piping hot, crispy \"arrancia\" - Sicilian Rice Balls, quickly disappeared. They were filled with luscious saffron rice, gooey mozzarella cheese and savory mushrooms. For the vegetarians of the group a crisp bruschetta with a bright green fava and mint puree appeared, topped with a variety of heirloom tomatoes. The balsamic drizzled on the plate was finger-lickin' good!\n\nNext, we were treated to several pasta primi (first courses). Plates of pillowy-soft ricotta gnocchi were sauced in a bright lemony-tomato cream, studded with chunks of sweet crabmeat.  A spicy (some thought too spicy) rigatoni with tuna as well as house-made taglietelle with a variety of roasted mushrooms and baby artichokes were quickly devoured. \n\nBelieve it or not - there was more!!  Next plates of Bisteck - a fried beef steak topped with fried egg, prosciutto and provolone in a savory sauce arrived.  A bit too salty for my taste, but certainly enjoyable. They run heavy on the salt here - so keep that in mind and if your are sensitive to sodium TELL THEM before you order.\n\nFor the non-meat eaters, there was Mackerel served over faro salad with roasted red peppers and (more) fennel.  Next came heaping bowls of fall-off-the-bone-tender pork osso bucco (folks ate all of it including the marrow).  An innovative accompaniment to the osso bucco were sweet chestnut pancakes.  Really super!\n\nOur vegetarian friends enjoyed a smokey, freshly baked eggplant parmesan.  Delightful!\n\nFinally, small dessert trays were passed among the tables.  A sweet vanilla panna cotta was topped with a rich strawberry/balsamic mix.  Gooey, rich, flourless chocolate \"brownie\" cake was enrobed in a thick salted caramel sauce.  A lemon bar, drizzled with raspberry sauce was topped with crunchy coconut shreds.  (By now many of us were too full to eat dessert - but somehow we managed!)\n\nKudos to Marguerite and Tyree - two of the 5 or 6 servers who helped our lively group.  They kept the water glasses filled and the plates cleared efficiently.  Such outstanding service!\n\n5 star service - and nearly 5 star food - a few dishes were found by some to be overly salted or spicy - but in a group of 30 tastes can vary widely.\n\nI can't wait to go back - and I will surely try the new Delco spot.",

The food is Italian influenced American and all of us had veal dishes.\n\nThe iceberg lettuce salads were blah and overly dressed in a vinegary-balsamic vinaigrette.  This was made up for by the delicious Veal (or chicken) Irene - with crabmeat and pencil-thin asparagus.  \nMy mom had a veal picatta which she enjoyed.  DH had veal parm whic he said tasted freezer burnt.\n\nWe intend to return again to give them another shot (service was good, by the way - friendly and attentive without being pushy) but if things don't go well that'll be it.\n\nSeems like it'd be a fun bar to go hang out in, though.  Happy Hour (4-6 PM Mon - Thurs) offers $2 beers and $5 house wine.",

I am hoping to get a favorable reply.\n\nCustomer service has been excellent.

It was $28 and used pure shea butter, sea salt and cruished cucumbers (they put it in a food processor).\n\nVery cooling and wonderful for summer.\n\nJustin - Karina's fiance was there - and he is a very nice guy and runs things well.\n\nIt's a beautiful (pricey) spa.  I am fearful the polish will yellow or chip. (I told them about my previous experience with yellowing - and they said NO SUNSCREEN or bug spray.  Turns out I had, indeed, applied sunscreen after my services a year ago - MY BAD!)\n\nI still wish we could bring our own polish - and I kinda thing it's ridiculous that for the MONEY we are paying (I dropped $100 even today including tip) we can't use our OPI or CND products for fear of destrying her air quality.  That still seems a bit wrong, but anyway - If I can get a decent wear out of her products (all water based polishes), I will come back again.\n\nDefinitely for pedis - not sure if I can justify a $28 mani every week - or even every 2.\n\nTierra Mia - you are a beatiful, unique place.  I am sure you will be very successful.",

The even have a deal they will do with schools for fundraising.\n\nThe wheels are turning...  Perhaps a Panda Feast (for $30 you get 3 large entress and 2 large sides - enough for 4 (easily) to 7 (tiny eaters) people.  A big pan entree $36 - $48 if you pick shrimp feeds about 8 people.\n\nThey also have a small catering package for $96 that easily feeds 16.\n\nI am planning a prty soon and will update my review with the results - but so far I am shockingly pleased with Panda Express.",

(Some how we managed (wink-wink).)\n\nThe kiddo loved her black bean and BACON (she asked for it special and they made it for her) quesadilla.  Fan-frikkin-tastic!\n\nCan't wait to return.  We were treated like royalty.\n\nWe can't thank you enough!!!",

(Luckily no car exhaust fumes and no weirdness - plus the aforementioned PERFECT balmy, non-humid, sunny spring day made for a perfect 2 PM reservation.\n\nMy 6 year old chowed down on the (boring coled) bread basket right away and ate about a third of her ENOURMOUS (same size as the grown ups) $7.50 kids meal of spaghetti with marinara sauce.\n\nMy mom had an antipasta salad which was chock-full of goodies including fresh mozz., marinated artichoke hearts and marinated mushrooms (I ate her 'shrooms - and found then a tad too vinegary for my liking), but my mom loved it.\n\nDad had liguine al vongole (white) with small tender clams (in shell) and strangely enough - very LIGHT on the garlic.  (usualy liguini with clam sauce is garlic city - but not here.)  He ate every bite and the sauce was perfectly clammy and olive-oil without being a puddle of oil.  NICE!\n\nI loved every bite of my Fettucini with Eggplant (the little one has decide now that she's tried Spaghetti, Liguine and Fettucine all at one meal that she likes fettucine now - so she at a few twirls of mine).  The pastas were all perfectly cooked.  Al dente.  not mushy, not undercooked either.  YUM.\n\nToo full for dessert.  Not super expensive.\n\nI sure hope the renovate soon.

Why not 5?  The space is just too small for all the equipment they have crammed in there.  And the studio for mat classes, while adequate for 5 or fewer students (which is usually the case) is way too packed for the 10 people max they will except.\n\nI also wish you could get a package of 5 Privates or 5 Semi-Privates instead of 10.  Even with a price break $700 is just too much to shell out at once - for me anyway.\n\nKaren Pecarsky, the owner, runs a good business and has good client service skills.  Her instructors, especially Danielle and Lucia (Lucia's Tower classes will kick your a$$) are terrific.  The online reservation system is a little problematic, but so far I have purchased 2 packages from here.  (Thanks for giving my friend her free mat class for refering me!)\n\nI will buy another package, barring no unfortunate occurences.\n\nSo far I am liking it here.  Alot.  Wish Jeff Prall taught here.  He is my favorite Philly Pilates instructor.\n\nOh - and did I mention that I am so glad to find a Power Pilates (brand) studiio?  That's the kind I took from Allisa Stein and Susan Moran when I lived in NYC.  To me Power Pilates is a strong, solid modaility.\n\nLucia, girl - in my mind you are the mini-Romana.

The Sangria, to me, was the tastiest of the 3.  \n\n$6 apps included sliders in 3 varieties (any combination you choose), cheeseburger, mini crab cake (great) or buffalo chicken.  We also tied the waffle fries and lettuce wraps (from the regular menu) and carrot cake for dessert.\n\nWe had a great time socializing and listening to the (loud) 80's and 90's background music. \n\nShout out to MELVIN for top-tier service.",

The facialist Elina was excellent.  the facial itself was also very good - and the home-made vegetable based (cucumbers and parsley) mask was the best part of the \"Seasonal Phacial\" that I got.\n\nThey are running a deal thru 5/2/09 where you can get one of 4 different PHacials (cute - huh?) for $60 - instead of the list price of $110 - which nobody pays.  I say that because she also has a discounted series price and cut me a deal to get a series of 3 more phacials - so I did.\n\nIf you are a client of UrbanFront Pilates - next door - she will definitely work with you.\n\nFor $60 I had a great facial and Elina did an extensive arm, neck and back massage, too.  The products are all cheap private label - sorry - but they are.  The just have Ursula's label on them.  The cleanser and toner were good - but very standard.  I am a product junkie and didn't buy any products.  Thankfully, neither Ursula nor Elina tried to push any on me - they were both sweet as sugar.\n\nI can't wait to go back for my $50 back treatment nerxt week.\n\nSo for $60 it's a 5 star facial - but for $110 - no way - maybe 3 stars.\n\nI will compromise and give them 4.  They are definitely worth checking out.  Also Ursula charges a very, very high price for lash application.  I'll be doing them myself.\n\nOh well.\n\nOh, and they offer REAL sugaring (not wax mixed with a little sugar, sugaring.).\n\nElina is really the star of the show, so I hope Ursula treats her well.  She is a good facialist and I know one when I feel one!",

I have only been here twice and both times (with my parents, of course - who LOVE the fresh mozzarella salad and prime-rib (or is it filet) beef sandwiches.\n\nThe first time we went my daughter was a wee 6 or 7 months old and I was in a post-partum haze.  The experience was a drag from soup to nuts.  (Nevermind that we did not order any soup nor nuts).  Mom ordered and raved about her fresh (and milky white) mozzarella and tomato salad.  Dad was in red-meat heaven.\n\nStrangely enough we never actually get any beer here.  (The 'rents don't drink it.)\n\nThen little angel-pie decided to pee in her diaper.  So I had to change her diaper.  And things got ugly.  There was NO WHERE - and I mean no where to change her.  The ladies room was a one-person operation with NO changing tabel and no area.  The floow in there seems icky.\n\nSo I whipped out my portable changing pad (waterproof) and tried to subtley and quickly change her on a tabletop in the back hallway.\n\nI was immediately yelled at by a (male) manager to stop.  I basically ignored him - as I was nearly done anyway) and finished wiping the babies butt, threw the dirty things in a plastic baggie, threw the baggie backinto my diaper bag and went back to the table.\n\nI was so ticked off.  I mean, what was I supppsoed to do - there was NO WHERE to change this kid.  A 6 month old baby.\n\nWhatever.\n\nSo anhow - thety have great food and a terrific selection of salads - but don't bring a non-potty trained kid here.  (In our case an infant.)\n\nRant over.",

At $2.50 a slice this is a good way to get pizza by the slice - they have a ton of choices including \"square\" Sicilian, tomato pie, Hawaiian and many more.\n\nAnd the garlic knots are, indeed, yummy.",

    "text": "It was my first time at Zama and I dined alone and sat at the sushi bar.\nI had completely forgotten that it was restaurant week - and while the set menu looked fetching, I opted for a few a la carte items.\n\nI started off with a trio of handrolls.  The fish was fresh and excellent - but the lovely server, Roxanne - who explained so very many things to me - forgot to tell me that they come wrapped in soy paper.  Had I known I would have requested nori.  (I like the crunch of nori with a hand roll - espescially with the salmon one.)  No matter - they were so perfect.\n\nI also had a side order of ohitashi (spinach) - which I love.  The portion was very small - and it was a side - so I ordered something else.  \n\nSomething heavy.\nSomething decadent.\nI so should not have order this - but I did and I loved it, too.\n\nThe braised short rib app over crispy larmen.\n\nOh.  Boy.\n\nThe bill including 1 non-alcoholic drink (a refreshing limeade) and tax 'n tip was $40.\n\nNot bad.\n\nDecor is gorgeous - a giant paper koi on the ceining and great light woods and textures throughout.\n\nZama - I am infatuated and will return soon.  Can you win me over from Doma? You are nearly 5 stars.\n\nWe shall see.",

I went again today and again had to buy a $1.80 bottle of Fiji.\n\nVic offers a great roll cominbation special and also serves some creative and (fattening - too much rich sauce) non-traditional rolls.\nOrder the sauce on the side and problem is solved!\n\nOne item worth getting though is the \"tuna dumplings\".  This is really a sashimi type appetizer.  Thinnly sliced raw tuna is filled with a creamy avocado mixture (again - fat-city) and molded into a dumpling shape.  Worth a try if you are into avocado.\n\nAlso try the Sansom Roll. It is a meal in itself.\n\nRecently I also tried (and now have dreams about) the Ocean brother roll - a huge roll stuffed with shrimp tempura and avocado,  and outside has a delicious mildly-spiced CRAB SALAD (real crab) and wasabi tobiko.  It is usually drowned in eel sauce, so again - I get mine with brown rice, sauce on the side.  (I know, I'm a picky pain in the ass.)\n\nI prefer to go to Vic at Lunch time as it is not a dinner place.  Way too small - only 8 seats at the bar and NO TABLES.\n\nNote:  As of July '08 prices have gone up and there are no more 2 roll lunch combos - you must now get 3 rolls for $11.95 - which is still a good deal.

Since it was a lovely evening, I decided to have a drink on the terrace, and selected a table out in the open air.  I put down my water bottle and asked the (very pregnant) hostess where the ladies room is.  She explained that I needed to go down 1 flight on the elevator.  Great.  Fine.  \n\nWhen I get back there is some guy sitting at \"my\" table and my water bottle is gone.\n\nSo I move to another outdoor table - and the host (not the hostess) brings me a bottle of water (huge 27 oz. bottle of fancy-schmancy water from Norway - which - by the way - was damned tasty water.) to replace it.  I order a virgin Mexican Mojito - which was perfect, by the by, - a refreshing libation of club soda, fresh lime juice and basil-infused (you really could smell it) simple syrup.  Limeaid with a twist.  FAB-U!\n\nSo I drink my mocktail and quite happily sit and chill until way, way past 6 PM.  At 6:15 or so I call my g.f. - guess what???  She's seated in the dining room and has been there for half an hour.  Nobody came to get me.  Nobody told her I was there.  No nothin'.\n\nSo I ask to move to the table, and we chat and order.\n\nDecor:  5 stars.  The dining room with it's pussy willow & pearl theme and MARVELOUS rotunda is so breathtaking. \n\nService: 2 (Chuck gets a 4 or 5 - he was great), everyone else was snotty and/or pre-occupied).  VERY SNOTTY.\n\nFood - varies - 3-4 - here's why:\n\nWe started with salads.  I splurged and ordered the lump crabmeat salad which was truly delicious and lightly dressed in an orange-champagne vinaigrette.   The tomatoes were red, ripe and actually tasted like tomatoes.  The small chunks of avocado were smooth and buttery.  The bibb lettuce was right on!  For $15 bucks (whoa-momma!( that was my kinda salad.  For $15 bucks you could put a little more crab - though I must say the crab that was there was sweet and PURE lumbo lump meat.  Nary a shell!\n\nWe both had the(only vegetarian) tagliatelle entree.  The pasta was hand-crimped, and light and luscious.  It was bathed in a lemony (very sharp, but I got used to it) buttery sauce and LOADED with various hoity-toity mushrooms including morels, hen-of-the-woods, oyster and others.  If you don't like shrooms - do NOT order this.  Quite frankly I was mushroomed-out by the end of it and left (no joke!) over 1/2 cup of these precious morsels - I ate all the morels - plate side).  I also chased down all of the succulent beans (small fava - large lima - something else??)  and fresh sp[ring peas.  Oh - and there were ramps and FIDDLEHEADS.  A nice spring dish.  High-end veg for sure. But quite alot of mushrooms.\n\nFor dessert had a kickin' strong cup of Illy cappucino.  Good - but somehow not as good as the cap at Davio's.  A bit bitter.  Wesplit ahome-made waffle with nutella & berry compote.  The waffle itself was great.  I would have preferred less \"glop\" on top of it,but my friend preferred the sauces to the waffle. She digs nutella.  Oh - and they put a little green candle in the scoop of (homemade??) vanilla ice cream on top of the waffle.\n\nThankfully nobody sang!\n \nSince someone else paid, It was a 4 star time, but honestly?  Forthe money there are much. much better places to eat - and drink - not only in Philly - but in Philly high-end hotels.\n\nThat said - the private dining room is nice- and I would definitely do a business lunch or dinner here.\n\nBut for my own life?  I doubt if I'd run back here.",

This was quickly corrected and we were on our way except - no ketchup.\n\nThey forgot ketchup packets.  Oops.

We come back to the JAI (where we were married on 06/07/08) every year on our anniversary for dinner.  the past 2 years we brought our DD and both sets of parents.\n\nThis year it was just us and our DD who is now 6.\nShe had a delicious lobster mac 'n cheese with smoked Gouda.\nShe also ate one of my 4 lamb rib chops which were divine.\nShe also had 3 bites of my husbands salmon which was perfectly cooked.  (All that stuff was 5 star).\n\nHere's the bad part - HIGH salt content for sides and sauces.  My sauteed mushrooms were so salty I had to say something and send them back.  Inedible.  They promptly cooked another (only slightly less salty) batch which I took home - and may toss.\n\nDH's salmon was on a bed of soba noodles drowning in a sweet/salty sauce that, too, was over-salted.\n\nWhat a shame.\n\nMeanwhile the apps wre AWESOME - some of the best sweet potato fries we've ever tried (and we try them at lots of places) .  Served with a warm marshmallow \"fluff-like\" dip.  HEAVENLY.\n\nThe smoked duck tostada was great, too.  (If a bit on the smokey side.  Yes, it is very smokey indeed.)\n\nDessert coffees at $8.50 are a delcious indulgence - topped with a cloud of REAL whipped cream.  Chocolate covered strawberries (call ahead to speacil order these) are LARGE, plump, red, sweet and juicy coated in luscious chocolate.\n\nWe love it here - and got to watch the end of a Saturday wedding and the rehearsal for a Sunday wedding.  Lots of weddings, showers and events are held here - and we know why - it's a GREAT venue for events.  (And now they can accomodate a larger wedding in the expanded ballroom.)\n\nWe love ya, Tegue & Neil!  Best regards to Wendy, too.  See you in June 2012.",

All of a sudden our table was ready!  (So great - because we were hungry by then - and the wait was only about 8 minutes!)  In future I would recommend reservations for Friday or Saturday nights here - the summer Gay Street scene is pretty hoppin'.\n\nThe tables are pretty close together (we sat outside on a lovely night) so we got to know a couple from Atlanta next to us.  Everything they ordered and everything we ordered looked amazing. We enjoyed our drinks - I had an $8 Kir Royale and DH had a Belgium Raspberry lambic that smelled and tasted so sweet and fruity (you better like fruit!) that even I could have easily drank it.\n\nOur proscuitto and melon app - at $13 - was 5 star perfection.  The large ball of creamy fresh Mozzarella (di Buffala!!!) was divine.  It was served with 2 slices of panini-pressed bread that was good for dipping into the lemon-noted olive oil on the plate.\n\nDH & I both ordered pasta as our main dish - mine was a special of pappardelle (house made - and a little on the thick side but perfectly cut and cooked to a toothsome al dente) with shrimp (5 medium sized ones) and lumps of crab meat (sweet, shell-less and delectable).  DH had the penne a la vodka and I did not taste it but it looked great, too.\n\nWe shared a delicious creme brulee (the top was stll warm from being blow-torched) for $8.\n\nCappuccino (at $5 - ouch!) was a let down.  Extremely bitter tasting and I fear the beans were burnt.  I could only drink a few \n\nThey are sooooo close to 5 stars on food - but there are a few areas for improvement that are holding me out on the 5th star. (Fix your ladies room stall doors and the lights on the stars, please!)  Food snobs from NYC or Philly may shun the 'burbs - but Teca was a big winner for me last night.\n\nWe'll be back - hopefully soon - to see if they can keep it up.\n\nOh - and I wanna buy a bottle of that olive oil that is supposedly pressed at the owner's place in Italy. Good stuff!",

My 12-year-old scarfed down a traditional lamb/beef gyro, and I had the pork souvlaki (tender and juicy - so good.)\n\nAvgolemono soup is one of my favorites ($4.95 for a nice large bowl of it) but this one was only fair.\n\nEverything comes with fries - costs more to have a greek salad instead.  (The salad is on romaine and is very fresh and tasty.\n\nDecor is brand-spankin' new and clean looking.\nThey really gutted this place and it shows.  WELL DONE.\n\nWe wish you the very best - and I will be headed back in soon for some Dolmades and Baklava (have not tried them yet.).",

Served with 2 eggs and CRISPY long bacon strips.  It was the picture of perfection and - according to my friend - tasted great as well.\n\nMy unique dish was the crab-cakes benedict.  (luckily I asked for the sauce on the side - as I did not need the extra glop/calories).\n\nThe 2 crab cakes (one atop each english muffin half) were VERY good.  Lots of crab and not too much filler.  I was even able to get broccoli in lieu of home fries.\n\nWe each ordered soft drinks which were served in large \"vats\" (free refills) and Fran got us to-go cups, which was a nice extra touch.\n\nWe'll return for sure!

You get the idea...\n\nBut we all can agree on Wegman's.  It is a pleasure to shop here and the selection is great.  If you are a comparisson shopper (and in our family - you are!), you can also nab some good bargains here.\n\nWe got some terrific imported cheeses and yummy prepared foods here and made a gourmet picnic for a fraction of the cost of having it catered.\n\nWegman's also does a fairly good job of appetizing/catering of their own - but we prefer to just buy the componenets and assemble them ourselves on trays.\n\nWegman's is great.  Wish there was one in Center City Philly!",

Not my fave. \n\nMeanwhile, we went here last night and had very good service and EXCELLENT food.\nAnd the best part?  One of the tastiest French 75 cocktails ($10) made to perfection.\n\nThe only food downer?  The French Onion Soup which had way. way toomuch rosemary - as in sticks 'n twigs of it.  (Not salty though - and served in a Big bowl for $8).\nThe best part?  Both entrees- mine and DH's.  He had the Duck confit crepe - which I tasted and we both loved.  I had the duck with raspberry sauce - cooked to perfection (I like my duck with plenty of quack still left in it).  The haricot vert and fluffy (buttery-chivey) mashed potatoes were also divine.\n\nI shall return. And I will bring our 9 year old - she loves duck,\nVery pleased!!!\n\nNice place for a date night,too.  Much smaller inside than I had imagined.",

She is the best part of this ME location.\n\nThe massage therapists come and go and come and go and frankly, I have not yet had one (since Hudson - who left and I knew he would) that I can say is excellent.  They are fine.  Not bad and not awesome but fine.  Alot of the therapists are fresh out of school or looking to establish or re-establish a following and then they leave.  I have only had one truly BAD massage here and the therapist was let go shortly thereafter (She was a true \"space case\").  I have also had some GREAT massages here and then the therapists have left (Hudson [who was reverse commuting in from Philly] and Sam - who had personality problems).  Mindy and Mary seem to be good.  Mindy has treated my kid and my kid LOVES her so I am praying she will stay. Please STAY for a while, Mindy!!!!\n\nMeanwhile, the front desk staff (also a bit of a revolving door - I hope they keep Celeste as she is terrific!!) is quite good and the owner seems to really know her stuff. Go, Celeste!\n\nAs a former spa owner, I am truly picky about who(m) I let touch my face - and Billie Joe is a gifted esthetician (formerly was at Toppers, I believe).\n\nSo like I said - try out Billie Joe for a facial (I like the Vitamin C one) .\n\nOh - and if you get a good massage therapist - I hope you will encourage them to STAY.\nI really miss Hudson.  He was great.  I am hopeful who(m)ever I get next will be a \"keeper\".\nBillie Joe and Celeste are keepers. Please do right by them!\n\nOh - and the facility itself is gorgeous and clean and well-maintained.  Love it!",

In the summer-  the gazpacho is a refreshing and tasty choice.\n\nThe specials of the sday - often fish and omelettes are also really, really great.  They often sell out of the fish special - so come early for your lunch.  They don't do dinners - although last summer they briefly toyed with a \"dessert cafe\" concept which I wish had fared better.\n\nAnyhow - it's a great place to grab a safe, reliable lunch.",

Took my parents there, too and they enjoyed the meat dishes and tasty salads.\n\nThere are several dining rooms, but I love the bar which is canopied by green plants and flowers.  (There are 2 bar areas - maybe 3.)\n\nFrom the outside RTC looks kinda like a biker bar - and it always looks closed.  It's not.\n\nInside - wherever you sit - you'll get great food and lots of drink options.\nWe really love the desserts.  White Chocolate 7 Strawberry bread pudding was a delicious special one night.  Really.  Try the desserts.\nSometimes I just get an appetizer and a dessert and I am FINE with that.\n\nCan't wait to go back.",

(Sorry, Miran.)\n\nI got a Galbi for dinner and upgraded (for $1.00) to the multigrain rice - which I am so glad I did.  The rice and grains were so healthy-tasty.  The Galbi was \"textbook perfect\" with a delicious BBQ flavor and just the right amount of fat. (Not greasy - but tasty and beefy.)\n\nThe side dishes of Kimchi and Sweet Yellow Soy beans were also \"textbook perfect\".  The Gabli and rice came with a mixed green salad dressed lightly in a soy dressing - fresh and good.  Also steamed carrots - naturally sweet and a few YUMMY edamame.\n\nWhat a great meal.\n\nCan't wait to come back again.  (Wanna get a Dolsot Bibimbop next time.)\n\nOh, and the man behind the counter (who I am guessing is the manager and possibly the owner) was very nice.  It's counter service, but he was so friendly to me. (It was not busy when I came.)\n\nAlso the clean bathrooms have really cool tiles.  BONUS!",

It is really high-priced for faux-pub - but I gotta say they do a few things there really, really well.\n\nFor instance, one of my dining companions is from England and ordered a Bomdardier which he said was well poured and not \"too fizzy\".  It was however, served much cooler than you'd get back home.\n\nMy entree of Hake was delicious served in a buttery lemon caper sauce over a small bed-ette (to small to call it a bed) of kale.  Not dry - in fact it leaned toward the underdone side - and thus was tender and large-flaky.\nI also enjoyed the cold poached shrimp (5 for $14 - large ones) with lemon mayo & cocktail sauce.  Simple - but so tasty!\n\nDesserts are not a strong suit save for the hot chocolate pot. (worth the 15 minute wait - order this with dinner if you are in a rush). Skip the Eton Mess unless you like TART fruit.\n\nMy decaf cappucino (not listed on the menu - but ask and ye shall receive) was EXCELLENT.  Try a Pimms Deluxe (or a classic Pimms cup) for a refreshing treat. Oh - and they have (for $5.50 each - OUCH) fancy-schmancy organic bottled sodas from the UK - I had a Luscombe's Sicilian Lemonade that was great and worth the 134 calories of sugar-water.  (THat's ORGANIC sugar water to you!).  And they carry Ribena (a blast from the past!).\n\nI may be back - but for the price point, I'll be waiting a while.\nOh - and I won't be missing Mantra!",

Service was fine - our male server (Mike??) was on point with drink refills and bringing the check (it was quite busy on a rainy Thursday from 12:15 - 1:30 ish). Restroom was clean and comfortable.  Decor is very nice.\n\nMy only complaint?  The chicken tostada was fried - as in battered and fried and dripping in grease.  Next time (if I get that item) I will ask if they can do it with grilled chicken.\n\nSteamed spinach (by request) was perfect and I am glad I asked because one colleague's meal came with sauteed spinach which he said was loaded with salt and oil.\n\nPlease folks, ease up on the fatty foods and we will return much more quickly.\n\nThanks!",

She got an Orange/Vanilla Hi-C - talk about a sugar high!\n\nFriendly young gals running the counter. Very good service. Especially Amanda - she is so kind to us and even gave my kid a plush toy when my kid did not win one from \"Tha Claw\" machine.\n\nWe'll be back - way better burger than Zac's!\nNext time I will skip the sweet potato fries (but maybe I'll try a milkshake).",

The breaded Olives - which we loved, the Riceballs - were Good but not WOW and a truly terrific tomato, fresh fior-de-latte mozzarella and grill artichoke salad.\n\nIt was so great.\n\nThen the entrees came.

Lamb chops and skewers of  Chicken and home-cured sausage.  Both entrees came with roasted potatoes.\n\nWe had no alcohol - just soft drinks.  Oh yeah, my husband did have a beer - a good one - and orange-blossom scented pale ale.  Nice.\n\nFor dessert the chef - who was kind enough to chat with us, comped us a platter of 3 desserts.  A traditional cassata-like cake (good - not great), a silky panna cotta (YUM) and the best - LIMONCELLO-soaked tiramisu.\n\nThat would be worth the usual $7 for-a-dessert charge.\n\nI really, really like this place and would welcome the chance to go back.\nThe patio in summer is nice, although we sat inside.\n\nIt was a lovely time.",

She loved the mango sorbet and vanilla ice cream, of course. \n\nThey had a \"special\" somewhat limited and pricey NYEve menu. I had the mushroom ravioli which was absolutely delicious. My friend had the Chilean Sea Bass and LOVED it. We are **this close** to giving it 5 stars, but my husbands fillet mignon (came with lobster) was overcooked. \n\nThe appetizer of HUGE bacon-wrapped, vegetable stuffed jumbo shrimp was divine - served over 2 sauces: rich horseradish cream and raspberry coulis - swirled together on the plate. At first I thought $15 for 2 shrimp seems INSANE - but they were, indeed, HUGE. \n\nThe desserts were, of course, the BEST part - and on New Year's eve they were each garnished with gold-leafed chocolates that said \"Happy New Year\" on them. (My 4 year old gobbled down the chocolates with glee.) The Black & White creme brulee was perfectly prepare with a hot crispy top and cool creamy sweetness beneath (My husband & I shared it). My friend got the espresso chocolate torte - which really was overkill. Just a bit too-too if you know what I mean - but if you are a chocolate/espresso lover you could catch a wicked buzz off of that! (Served with 3 chocolate covered espresso beans - which alone would make me buzz.) \n\nOur server was friendly and attentive - although i think she secretly was not thrilled about us bringing our young child in. \n\nOh - and I had 3 Arnold Palmers - you know what a big drinker I am. \nThey were terrifically refreshing. \n\nThe chefs are great guys who can really \"throw down\". I just love the rose tattoo. They are really, really, close to 5 stars for me.",

At 3 tacos per order for $9.50 - that was very fair.\n\nThe only culinary \"oops\" were the twice-fried french fries.  They were hard as rocks and cold.  Kinda greasy and blah tasting.  I bet they sat around due to the low-turnover night.  I bet they taste better fresh outta the fryer.  Too bad.\n\nOodles of beers on tap and by the bottle - even a choice \"by the cask\".  Hubby got a Blueberry wheat pale ale - which tasted great.\n\nThe chocolate beignets and other choices tempted us from the dessert menu, but alas, we did NOT order dessert as we were too stuffed to manage it.\n\nLess pretentious (and less cutesy) than Pub & Kitchen - this is not a gastro-pub - it's simple bar food with a fresh tasting twist.\n\nI live walking distance so I'll be back for sure!",

    "text": "We went to Indonesia last night as part of the foodie group (Shout out to Foodie M!) of 31 people.  For $35 (including tax & tip - BYOB) per person we had an absolute banquet of food. 2 Diet Cokes we ordered in addition were less than $3.00.  Dang - I should brought some bubbly!\n\nOur hosts (the owner and 2 attentive, hard working servers) treated us so well.  We had the entire private banquet room upstairs, and it was lovely, with fresh flowers on the long table, and ice water ready for us.\n\nOur appetizers were balls of sticky rice stuffed with aromatic chicken, wrapped in a banana leaf.  (The banana leaf is used prevelantly in Javanese cookery).  I liked it, but it coulda used some dipping sauce.\n\nNext we had a choice of soup - Chicken with coconut - different than Thai - and a little thinner - or an EXCELLENT Lamb soup.  The soup did have bones (lamb ribs) in it - so that turned a few people off - but I loved it - as the flavor was so tasty.  Lime leaves and lemon grass - and not at all \"too hot\" nor \"too spicy\".  I really, really enjoyed that soup.\n\nAfter the appetizer and soup I already felt full, but I tried to pace myself (and failed) for the formidable feast.  Each couple was served a lazy susan with about 6-7 different dishes on it.  Large bowls of yellow aromatic rice (so delish) were placed on each table so we could all have as much rice as we liked.  (The rice had a faint jasmine tea aroma to it and was so sweet and wonderful. - Carbo loading at its best.)\n\nThe dishes on our lazy susan included a succulent and tender beef curry.  Now, I am not a curry person - but this was terrific.  A lovely \"barbequed\" chicken in a sweet red pepper sauce was fragrant and tasty.\n\nAll the meats were flake-tender.\n\nI was not a big fan of the mackerel - again steamed with spices and wrapped in the ever-present banana leaf.  It tasted too fishy and cat-foodish for me.\n\nThe Udup-Udup - mixed vegetables with FRESH crispy bean sprouts and crunchy green cabbage was a good palate cleanser.\n\nFettucine-like strands of egg omelette were simply delicious as well.\nNasi goreng and Sate (yummy chicken sate) were on the platter, too.\n\nAnother stand out was the crisp, slightly sweet and calorie-laden corn & egg fritter.  Two of them were perched atop the center of the lazy susan and DH and I ate those right away while they were hot and perfect.\n\nBy now I was so full I could barely try the tempeh with shrimp and green beans (sounded better than it was) and Potato-meat croquettes (not my thing, but other people loved them).\n\nNot one but 2 dessert courses followed.\nFried bananas - one of my favorites - were served with a small pitcher of syrup.  \"They're not just for breakfast anymore\"!  The batter evokes a french toast (sans cinnamon) taste.  They were a little thickly breaded (I am accostomed to Japanese Tempura bananas) for my liking - but I was so stuffed that I really didn't mind.\n\nThe final dessert was really. Well.\n\nWeird.  It was a warm \"soup\" of sweet (slightly chalky) coconut milk, with pieces of (yummy) jackfruit), tapioca pearls, mung beans, shredded green jello (eeeew) and pieces of white bread.\n\nMaybe it was because I was now too full to enjoy anything - but this type of dessert (take every tpical Javanese dessert item and put it in a bowl) would not ever be my cup of tea.  (Or soup - as the case may be.)\n\nThe best part of the evening was the terrific conversation and friendships made.  Foodie M.'s mom and sister sat near us - and that was terrific.\nWe also met another couple who were smart and funny and had been to Indonesia before (Though Balinese cuisine and easter Javanese are quite different.)\n\nI would highly recommend trying Indonesia and supporting this wonderful local business.\n\nA great time was had!",

    "text": "Wow - I honestly can NOT believe that nobody reviewed this venerable (old, ancient, classic, etc.) Media institution.\n\n\"The\" Townhouse has held countless High School reunions (even weddings), corporate luncheons and functions in their numerous party rooms (and the large \"ball room\" downstairs).\n\nI attended a small (25 people) dinner last night - but before it began we sat at the (again) classic bar downstairs where Barbara kept those refreshing Arnold Palmers coming!  She is a doll.  (And the $2.00 off each drink at happy hour (4-6 PM) and free munchies were a plus.\n\nThey also offer $3.00 bar snacks - but we saved room for our meal upstairs.\n\nOnce upstairs I had a ball looking at all those classic photographs from events long past (The 25th class reunion of the Class of '42, and even a picture of Mr. Biddle - when he was about 20 - from Drinker Biddle & Reath).  Nicki - our server has worked at D'Ignazios for 40 years!\n\nWe started our \"set\" meal with a very fresh green salad.  I had the tasty lobster ravioli and others had chicken or a veggie option.\n\nDessert was an uber-rich flourless chocolate cake.  It was drizzled in a raspberry sauce and tasted like eating fudge.  It was OK, but a bit much for me.  Other folks RAVED about it.\n\nSo, yes, I would definitely come here on my own for dinner - or book an event here.  They are \"old\" pros.  \n\nOne possible con?  It is an OLD place - so some of the decor is really authentic - so if you want a more polished look (like for a wedding?  I would, personally never do a wedding here) you may be turned off.  For a High School reunion or Corporate event?  PERFECT!!!!!",

    "text": "OK, I gotta update my review of OOKA, as we just had an incredibly GOOD night here.  Our first time coming with our 4 (nearly 5) year old and sitting at the teppanyaki grill. (No, it's not Hibachi.  It's teppanyaki, thank you very much.)\n\nWe made a same day reservation for 6:45 PM on a Saturday (tonight, actually) and were accomodated and got in just before it started to get packed & crazy - as Saturday nights at Ooka D-town are known to be.\n\nService was truly excellent.  The waiter and teppanyaki chef were both extra accomodating to the little princess - the chef even made an extra Onion Volcano during the teppanyaki grilling portion.  She was mesmerized.\n\nThe place had an unusually high number of kids and families - I guess I never noticed this before because every ogther time we have come sans bebe (thank god!) and usually we sit in the sushi dining room or at the sushi bar.\n\nOnce again I ordered the Seared striped bass with foie gras suishi and once again it was melt-in-your-mouth delicious.  Next time 2 orders!  It's that good. \n\nToro was a bit of a disappointment (but at only $7.00 I had to try one).  I also ordered 2 pieces of Maguro ($5.50 for 2 pieces vs. $7 for ONE toro - they said \"O\" but I bet it was \"Chu\".)  Anyhow the toro was a little gristley and the Maguro was perfect.  Next time I'll be skipping the toro and loading up on Hamachi (perfect and ocean-fresh) and the aforementioned seared bass with foie.\n\nDD & DH had teppanyaki meals -which are never a HG for me.  DD loved her shrimp, noodles and rice.  She wouldn't touch the veggies.\nHubby ate his chicken meal but said (as predicted) it was too heavy on the soy and the margarine (yes they slather that grill in grease).\n\nBringing kids?  The teppanyaki will keep them very entertained.  Want a better meal?  Order sushi based dishes.  (Just my opinion.)\n\nGo Ooka.  What a change from the Domino's pizza and ultra-conservative Christian Bookshop that used to inhabit the space.",

By the time we left at 6:40 it was filling up.\n\nEven though most people probably go to the Outback Steakhouse next door - I would say to come here instead.  Great service and solid Thai dishes.\n\nWe only oredered one item off of the Japanese section of the menu - a Tuna/Avocado Salad - served in the avocado shell.  YUM! ($12).\n\nMy fave - classic Tom Kha - was heavy on the lime juice but still delish.\nSteamed Thai dumplings were light and luscious.  (Will definitely get these again.)\nDrunken Noodles were a tongue-tingling treat.  Perfectly cooked noodles - tender not mushy.\n\nLOVE IT.\n\nGood service.\n\nWhy not a 5?  They neeed to CLEAN the fabric ceiling drapes - they are loaded with dust.  Eew. Also the Thai iced coffee was not great - and I usually love this.  There's was clyingly sweet and the coffee was so bitter. ($3) Won;t get it again.\n\nMeal for two (no alcohol, I think it's BYO).\n\nNote:  I have now been back 2 or 3 more times and the dishes are all good - sushi is fresh and Thai food is great.",

You could easily have a wedding here (150 people or less is probably best - we had 187 in our gfroup and the room holds 180 max. We were crammed in like sardines).\n\nThe tables were pre-set with salad (romaine with dill dressing - quite tasty), bread, pita and hummus (yum!).\n\nEntrees and dessert platters were served family style.  Food was delicious and excellent - especially the Branzino over \"greek-style\" roasted veggies - potato, zucchini, eggplant, peppers) - all were terrific.\n\nPasta alla Greca is an inexpensive way to feed a crowd.  Tasty - but too light on the spinach, IMHO.\n\nDeseert of a very nutty baklava (good but not the best I've tried) and a moist bordering on wet-with-syrup walnut cake.  People either loved it or hated it - I enjoyed it, but it is WET and very, very, cloyingly sweet.\n\nNote:  They have a private wine room for dining up tpo 14 people.\nI sense a party in my future at ESTIA!\n\nGreat for pre/post theatre, too.

The chef-owner has an ENORMOUS wine collection and the selection of wines - bottles and by the glass is astounding.\n\nThe 2-level restaurant - open for about 7 years - is scheduled for a re-model soon - but we hope they won't change the FABULOUS 5 star menu choices.\n\nDH & I sat in a lovely round booth on the 1st floor.  The upstairs was FULL with a private wine dinner party - maybe 60 people - and LOADS of stemware.\n\nWe started with drinks - a $12 red wine for him, a Moro (Sicilian Blood Orange) Bellini (made with house Prosecco) for me - $10.\n\nWe read over the extensive menu including a mind boggling array or antipasti (for 2 or more).  Eventually we decided.  DH started with a delectable Duck Confit salad with FRESH greens, shaved parm (the good stuff) on top and a mouthful of buttery-shreds of confit in EVERY bite.  I had the tuna tartare - which was served over \"smashed\" avocados - so it was kinda like a tuna tartare guacamole.  It was lightly sprinkled with Hawaiian pink salt (I told them to go light and they did!!!) for a terrific crunch.  YUM-CITY!\n\nOur 5 star entrees did not disappoint - with the daily special of proscuitto-wrapped venison over polenta for him, and a decadent papardelle with crispy pork jowl pieces and fresh green peas.\n\nHere's the only negative (which is why I am giving them 4 stars instead of 5,) - the a/c on the first floor was simply NOT sufficient.  We were seated near the wood-burning (gorgeous) oven and we were FRYING.  I mean sweating-hot frying.\n\nSO hot, in fact - we moved upstairs (about 10 degrees cooler) to have dessert on couches in the bar area.\n\nDessert was great, too - a berry creme brulle (a little too soupy) topped with a generous assortment of vanilla-sugared berries - black, blue, straw, rasp) and FLASH-FRIED mint.  You could taste the olive oil on the mint leaves.\n\nI could have just eaten the topping.  (The creme itself was not the greatest ever - but still very tasty, indeed.)\n\nOur server Michael is a pro - and a great guy.\nThe upstairs bartender whop handled us from dessert on (Grappa or Limocello, anyone?) was also very personable.\n\nI can't WAIT to return - but you GOTTA solve the a/c problem.\n\nSoooooooo close to a 5 star night!",

Her technique is excellent and my skin looked and felt wonderful afterward.\n\nI also had a much anticipated \"Raw Earth\" pedicure with Cati - a 41 year veteran who has won Best of Philly several times.  This was a 3 star disappointment.  Cati herself is a sweetheart and does excellent work - but the pedi was rushed.  She worked on me for 35 minutes max, and then the next client was there - waiting.  Cati is in such high demand that she is just waaaaaay over booked (a compliment, yes, but to the detriment of client service).  I don't care to spend such high prices for an in & out.  That said, I will come back again - but next time for the regular pedi.  $15 - $20 more for a quick application of CND Raw Earth Scrub & Mask - not worth it.\n\nThe spa itself is gorgeous and well managed.\n\nAside from high prices, I would now recommend Phoenix - especially for tourists.\n\nUPDATE: Crap!  its a day - and two days later and I broke out from the facial.  Nothing major but a bunch of small raised itchy bumps (pink - not red) along the jaw line and all over the face.   I think that nifty gommage she used was too much beta-hydroxy for me.  Too bad.",

We arrived for our (early) 5:30 PM reservation just as they were opening and thus, were the only people there.\n\nThe interior is very dark/dim/romantic and GORGEOUS.  The right hand wall is completely votive-lit in small arch-shaped alcoves.\n\nThe low leather chairs were very comfy - but we are both short, petiit women - not sure if a big guy would feeel the same.\n\nWe started with non-alcoholic drinks at the bar area (iced tea and Limonata).  The custom drink menu looked great - but we were driving.\n\nThen off to our table for dinner.\nWe split the YUMMY arugula salad with tasty candied almonds.\n\nThen she (vegetarian) custom ordered a $22 veggie/side dish plate and I had the Kobe beef appetizer in lieu of a full entree ($16).  My friends fava beans and kale \"casserole\" were delicious. She did not like the farro much.  My app was great - but not light.  It came with a rich parmesan crema - so good you could lick the plate.\n\nWe shared 2 desserts.  As mentioned by others - DON'T MISS THE CREME BRULEE.  Ours was banana  and was accompanied by 3 house-made 'Nilla-style wafers.\n \nWe also got the Chocolate Chocolate Chocolate trio which was not realy that great. The mouse cake was cold and very dense, the Napoleon had delectable house-made ice cream (choloate of course) and there was a torte-of-sorts with a delicous fresh whipped cream blob on top.\n\nMeanwhile with tax and tip our bill (no alcohol - remember) was $95.  OUCH.\n\nThus 4 stars.  It is great - but simply not a 5 star value.\n\nThis is a good place for a guy to take a girl to impress her. She may still not like you after the meal, but she'll have had a good time.\n\nOh - and it's $17 to valet park your car.  (My friend drove - I walked.)\n\nService was excellent.  (But it was early and we were the only guests until about 6 when a few LARGE party groups came in.)\n\nAlso -if I ever go back - I will go for cocktails \"mezze\" and dessert only.  The desserts are really worth it. That creme brulee is one of the best I've tried - complete with black specs of vanilla bean at the bottom, cold cream and a hot crackling sugar crust encasing the paper thin banana slices.\n\nKudos to the pastry chef!!!!",

I got a \"regular\" manicure ($16) a \"callus remover\" pedicure ($47) and 20 minutes of chair massage while my nails dried.\n\nThere are 6 pedi-thrones and 8 manicure tables at this colorful (green & orange) cheerful and CLEAN spa.  The pedicure I got was very good - not a holy grail by any means but it was throrough with a nice scrub and massage.  for $15 extra (too high if you ask me) I got the \"callus removing treatment\" which basically was a bit of high % glycolic in plastic wrap for 10 minutes.  Big whoop.\n\nThey also have an even MORE expensive ($62) SPA pedicure and the highest priced, POLARIS SPA pedicure (which - for another $10 - making the total a whopping $72 - you get a paraffin dip.)  Double whoop-de-doo.\n\nNow don't get me wrong - I am a pedi-afficionado and these are nice treatments - but the price points when you add them all up seem a bit above the norm.  They also have a weird pricing structure where you get a $1-$2 discount if you pay cash.\n\nI didn't have enough cash to cover all my treatments so I paid some with cash and some on my debit card (Including a $10 tip - I spent $98.00).\nNOTE:  You can not put the tip on your credit card - so bring SOME Cash with you.)\n\nThe lady who did my pedicure, Wanty, also did my manicure (very good, by the way) and and the chair massage (not great.)\n\nI would definitely go back here for nail services but no way I would book a body massage nor a facial here as I doubt these girls are estheticians.  What they are - is nail technicians.\n\nAnd decent ones, at that.\n\nGood find!",

Anthony himself did it and it was very good.  4 solid stars!\n\nI had a good experience yesterday at 5 PM at Nails by Anthony.  A man (who I presume is Anthony) greeting me nicely when I arrived (walk-in) and a lovely lady, \"Mimi\" agreed to do my manicure.\n\nI told her I wanted a \"regular\" manicure and 10 minutes of chair massage while my nails dried.  She said \"Massage 10 minutes? OK?\"\n\nOK.\n\nSo the manicure progresses nicely - she does a good job and then she does a fabulous hand and arm massage.  For a really long time.\nEvidently she thought I wanted the \"spa manicure\" which includes everything from the $12 \"regular\" manicure and adds 10 minutes of hand &amp; arm massage.\n\nSo at the end while my polish is drying - she reluctantly gave me a bout 3-4 minutes of a lackluster b.s. back rub.\n\nOK.  No big deal.  I kind of expect b.s. massages at nail joints.\nNext time - honestly, skip any kind of extra massage - not worth the $8-$10.\n\nI will however, be back for manicures - at $12 it was worth it.  The place is new and clean with 6 mani tables and 5 huge NEW pedi thrones.\n\nI wonder, however, as is so often the case, if this place will be just as nice 6-12 months from now.\n\nI kinda doubt it.\n\nExpect to see a 1-2 star downgrade in a year.\nThey are new and trying to get your business - so take advantage while you can.\n\nAlso - they have ONE GOOD package deal (Most of their \"packages\" offfer no discount) - for $55.00 you get a regular mani, regular pedi, eye brow wax, lip wax and 10 minutes of b.s. massage.\n\nPlease note - I did not try the waxing here - I only trust my eyebrows to Jennae or Cara at bodyrest - but if you feel like taking a chance on a cheapie brow wax - this may just be the place.\n\nThis is a good alternative to Rittenhouse nails or the dreaded Gomo.\nAgain - try it NOW while they are still new (open for 3 months so far.).",

Yelp for introducing me to DnA.\nThey are a great find - and if I lived in NoLibs I certainly would be a regular client of Rich.\n\nHe did a great color for me - single process and a decent cut.\nI have to say that my jury is still out of the cut - as I need to let it be for a few days.  I think it may make my face look fat.\n\nUPDATE:  OK - I am officially not happy with the cut.  But I love the color.\nI am scared to call them and tell them?  I don't want to downgrade them to 3 stars - as they really are a 4-5 star establishment.  I just don't like this cut at ALL.  (Still lovin' the color though.)\n\nThe spa is clean and gorgeous - and although it is nearly 2 years old - it looks BRAND spankin' new.  Excellent choices in color scheme (blue & white) and good design elements.\n\nMy only reason for not giving it 5 stars was the weird (somewhat icy) vibe I got from the assistant (It feels demeaning to say shampoo girl - as I am certain she does MUCH more than that.).  \n\nThe receptionist was cute and friendly and had GREAT HAIR.\nI got some serious hair envy from pretty much everyone who works there.\n\nI will return.  (So I hope the assistant won't totally hate me if she reads this review.)\n\nI would DEFINITELY go here for color.  Rich knows his stuff!  (And his mom - who just happened to be in that day for highlights) is a sweetie.",

Meanwhile, as hard to believe as it is, Chart house is a CHAIN.  It is a such a nice place, though - and a great \"special occaision\" restaurant.\n\nJust don't have a steak.  The salmon was excellent when I had it years ago.\nCome to think of it the steaks I also had quite a long while ago - perhaps they have a better beef supplier now.\n\nBut anyhow, yes I do recommend the Chart House - especially for Mother's Day (Father's Day) and birthdays.

Home-made Mozz - so creamy; A drizzle of \"the good stuff\" - aged balsamic; red, ripe, roma tomatoes; basil chiffonade.  SUPERB.\n\nThe lasagna was so rich I almost could not eat it.  (Although others I know would swoon over this.)  An excellent meaty bolognese - but the creamy sauce on top was just too much.  Delicate house-made pasta sheets.  Topped with a fried egg that was, alas, oddly cooked (Thus precluding me from awarding LaPorta the fifth star).  The egg was, indeed, fried = the bottom was actually crispy and brown - the top?  Raw.  Not runny (which I like) but raw albumin over the yolk.  Slimy.  Not good.\n\nMeanwhile the 2 pizzas our  table tried (Malfatta - neat! and a classic Margarita) were excellent.\n\nLots of love and care goes into this food and it shows.\n\nLOVE IT and will return soon.  But I'll try other things (like the salads which sound great) that are not quite so rich and heavy.\n\nGorgeous bar area and a rustic older dining room, too.\nLizzy - our server - and a brand-spankin'-new bus boy were pleasant and friendly.\n\nGood job, Peter!!!!!\nWelcome to suburbia.",

That's a good deal!\n\nThe salon has 2 pedi thrones in tiny roomettes, plus 3 mani tables.\n\nThe place was bustling-crowded as it was a Saturday AM and the hotel had alot of weddings.\n\nThe salon itself seems OK - the front desk needs to be more attentive and friendly - when I arrived a man was at one counter (on the phone) and a lady was at the \"payment\" counter with another person.  Neither acknowledged me for several minutes - until I waved at the guy on the phone.

    "text": "It will be hard to write a captivating review without re-stating many of the sentiments already expressed below, but I shall try...\n\nLast night we went to Buddakan Philadelphia (there are now 3 locations) which is celebrating 11 years in operation.  Surprisingly, even after living in Philly for nearly 4 years and trying tons of restaurants, this was our first visit.  Years back we visited and peeked inside to see the amazing Golden Buddha and the waterfall wall fountain. I had read the menu many times on the website - so I felt like I knew what to expect.  (N.B. they will be CHANGING the drink menu and dinner menu in a few weeks - finally.)\n\nDecor and Service were easily 5 star, but there are too many small details overlooked for me to give Buddakan that elusive fifth star.  (As Starr restaurants go, this is pretty typical in that there is some over-hyping going on - but for a restaurant like this to survive and thrive for 11 years - an eternity for a restaurant - they are doing alot of things right!)\n\nWe started with $11 - $13 drinks at the nearly empty  bar (from 5:30 - 6:10 on a recession summer Thursday - it got crowded around 8).  The enlightenment was too strong with tequila for me to drink, so I sent it back and tried the tickled pink which was cloyingly sweet and the Malibu rum was not a great idea.  Oh well.  Meanwhile the ASIAN MOJITO was well-balanced, with freshly muddled mint, a hint of ginger and delicious.  (NOTE:  THey are changing the drink menu in a few weeks - many of these cocktails have been on the menu for years and it's all gonna change.)\n\nNext the 3 of us sat at a great table on the main level (there is also a cute bar upstairs and more tables.).  One of us is a vegan and there are very few vegetarian options (and NO vegan apps! The edamame ravioli uses chicken stock)  He had vegetable fried rice (or could have had noodle dishes or the house salad.)  If you are a vegan - this is not a great place for you - unless you just want some drinks.\n\nEverything is served family style with sharing plate s- which for us is great as we all like to share (execpt my vegan friend who, natch, would not eat the fish or duck).  Chicken Dumplings were a step up from the frozen gyoza we get at our favorite sushi joints.  Tasty for sure - but not worth $9.  A scallion pancake topped with shredded shortrib meat was enjoyed by DH but way too salty for my tastes.  A miss at $12.\n\nEntrees were much better.  The miso black cod, that was so famous, lived up to most of the hype.  Perfectly cooked.  I subbed a DELICIOUS eggplant in lieu of the wasabi mashed potatoes.  That eggplant was GREAT - reminiscent of Kung Pao - it was studded with Pine Nuts.  YUM!\n\nDH ordered the thinly sliced duck breast - a bit too well done for me - but I like my duck with a bit more QUACK left in it.  The accompanying Corn Spoon Bread was AWESOME.\n\nDesserts were by far worth the extra calories.  3 people shared the chocolate Bento box ($14 with chocolatey-good 6 selections - easily feeds 3 by itself).  We also got the hot, fried, five-spice & sugar donuts.  Now this is how I wished the churros at Xochitl could be!  WOW!  Five slightly greasy, hot donuts with 3 delectable dipping sauces (well - the cream cheese was too thick to really be called a sauce) including a rich ganache.\n\nA cup of green tea and a Millenum Cocktail (rimmed with Tang - what is with Starr and his obsession with Tang in cocktails???) capped off a lovely early summer dinner.\n\nGreat for special occaisions - and the tab was $180 or so including tip which really isn't bad.  Expensive but not obscene (we spent more on dinner for 2 at Morimoto!!).\n\nI will be back - but maybe just for drinks and dessert!  (HA, HA!)\n\\\nOh - and I must mention our bartender Adele (She's there Thursdays thru Sundays) and our 5 year veteran server Meg who was charming and spot-on with our orders.\n\nOh - and if you want to (we didn't) they will valet park your car for $18.00).\n\nSo close to 5 stars - but not quite.",

On Chestnut Street? - below is an excerpt from 2/6/2020 in the Inquirer:\n\n\"Center City's flagging diner scene got a boost this week with the opening of the Chestnut Diner, a snazzy, two-story affair across from Liberty Place at 1614 Chestnut St. It occupies the former 4 Seasons Food Court, which closed last year.\n\nThe Chestnut, open 24 hours on weekends for now, joins the 24-hour Midtown III, that wood-paneled vestige of the 1970s two blocks away on 18th Street, and the more modern City Diner at Broad and South Streets, which also runs 24 hours on weekends.\"\n\nOur party of 4 had lunch there and server, Jen, a bubbly blond was terrific.\nThe food had some hits and misses.  (Breakfast is served all day)  The Cobb Salad was fresh and HUGE for $10.95 - came with a cup of soup. Burgers are served with fries and a cup of soup.  (A great value at $7.99 or 8.99).  Soft Drinks are $2.00 and come with refills.\n\nThe hot roast beef sandwich was a hot, gloppy mess.  PASS.\n\nAlso you pay \"up front\" which during a busy Friday lunch rush took quite a bit of time.\n\nCome hungry!  All the classic Diner Faves are here.\nNo more 4 season's salad bar.  Much nicer than Little Pete's (remember that??).\n\nI wish them much success.",

I opted for Shrimp and got 5 big ones atop a mound of fresh crisp greens, grape tomatoes, nicoise olives, cooked potatoes, blached naricot vert (yum!) and a luscious side of vinaigrette.\n\nI also sprung for a fresh-blended Arnold Palmer.\n\nThis place rocks!  Yes, I spent about $12 on lunch - but there was more than enough to take back to the office to eat tomorrow!\n\nHooray for Harry's as a fresh, quick seafood-lunch (they also do great burgers & fries with unique dipping sauces).",

Fresh shaved parmesan over the top.\n\nYes, the prices are steep - and a bit \"too -too\" for people like my parents - we prefere Luberto's which is more \"homey\" and alot cheaper - but for a romantic date or a birthday celebration?

That's right.\nGas station.\nWith food.\nIn freezers.\n\nPrices are $8.00 (cheese ravioli) to $16 (REAL veal parm) and each container feeds one big hungry guy or 2 normal people.\n\nLOVE the food - and so surprise to find it.\nAnd so sad to hear they are closing.

CND and OPI products, included an exfolliating scrub, a massage and a wrap with a chocolate/peppermint clay masque.  Pollish application was very good as well - so far no chipping (it's only been 2 days though.).\n\nWhat made it less-than-five star was the (gorgeous but) uncomfortable banquette that you sit on.  There are 6 pedi stations and they are just BEAUTIFUL to look at - but after a while my lower back pain started kicking in.  They do provide bolsters - but they were too wide for me.  It's a shame because you can tell alot of time and money went into the design of this spa and the nail area.  It is elegant, spotless and lovely.  But not very comfy.\n\nMeanwile - I can't wait to return and  get another pedi from Christine (Christy??).\n\nAnd I have a wondeful facial to look forward to in a few weeks.\n\nThis place is improving every time I go.",

    "text": "Well, at long last, I can scratch Le Bec Fin off my to-do list.  Finally, I was able to justify the expense...  My husband & I celebrated his birthday by attending Chef Georges Perrier's Chef's table last night.\n\nThe main dining room is amazingly gorgeous.  What a place for a wedding or party!  We were seated in a slightly less glam area at the front of the house at a long table for 20.  (17 in all)\n\nPerrier is running a special all summer Mon. - Thurs.  (20 seats per night) a \"pay what you wish\" 5 course set menu.  If you can, ACT FAST and get in on it before August is over.\n\nThe first course was the chilled pea soup from the regular menu.  Very good - but no way I would have ordered this in real life.  It was pluched with a dollop of almond ice cream which was heavenly.  (Made up for the fact that it's pea soup.)\n\n2nd course was a single seared scallop.  DH & I are not scallop lovers - in fact, DH won't touch 'em so he had a salade ennui (boring salad) in its place.  I forced myself to eat the scalop and it was, indeed, perfectly cooked and surprisingly good (for a scallop fan I bet they'd LOVE it.).\n\n3rd course was a slightly overcooked white fish called Limon (like a fluke or flounder).  I was looking so forward to this course and it was sauced with a lemon foam and plated over a few fava beans (yummy), chanterelles (a bit salty to my taste) and a tasteless hazlenut puree - the consistency and color of putty.\n\n4th course was the best (save for dessert which was REALLY the best.) - a rare hanger steak.  3 -4 morsels in a decadent bordelaise (or was it a red wine/demi glace reduction?).  The sauce was lick-the-plate worthy.\n\nAnd for dessert one of the BEST classic creme brulee.  Lightly laced with Gran Marnier and a crispy top.\n\nService was very attentive UNTIL the end when we needed our check.  At about 9:45 PM nearly everyone (there were several waitstaff) disappeared.\n\nThe Chef came out to our table prior to and during service and was collegial and utterly charming.  (Really.)  It helped that I speak un peu de francais and was seating next to a lovely, fluent, Belgian woman.  (Merci, Madame!)\n\nWill I return?  Oh yes - but not in a hurry.  I would simply like to sit in the bar downstairs and have desserts off that AMAZING dessert cart (not part of our meal, alas).  That opera cake has my name on it!\n\nBien Fait!\n\nOh - and don't laugh but I actually drank (again don't laugh) a Mojito with my meal (I know, I know - in a French restaurant) and it was GREAT.  And it was $10.  My husbands manhattan was $12.  They do not serve Veuve Cliquot - which was what I was jonesin' for.",

Some of the best (basic) Chicken and brocolli - tender white meat and not gloppy.  Outstanding shrimp lo mein with thinner than usual noodles - not overloaded with onion.  NOT GREASY.  A pleasure.\n\nRainbow shrimp was great, too- and not skimpy on the shrimpy.\nFriendly, efficient service and lovely decor.\n\nFull bar and sushi (did not try it yet.).\n\nWe can't wait to return.",

I will be generous and give it 4 stars - but my conscious is screaming \"3 stars\".  I reall would like to see them succeed.  The Callohwhill area needs new businesses.\n\nBut 3 of us had a very lovely dinner there last week.  The place was nearly empty - but you can see that the decor (which is lovely) is brand new.  The ladies room was clean and marble-ized and nice.\n\nService was very attentive - some might argue a bit much - as he asked my husband if he'd like to order any bread 3 times.  (I ordered a poori - with Shrimp as an appetizer which was fabulous in all its deep-fried glory).  My husband did not want any bread.\n\nReally.\n\nOur friend who dined with us is FROM India - and he ordered a Chana (can't remember) appetizer which we all enjoyed but it was served on a bed of shredded ice berg lettuce - which would NEVER happen in India.\n\nThe Lamb Curry was tender and mildly spiced.\nThe rice was excellent - as well cooked basmati can be.\n\nI would go back - but again - I am just not an Indian Food lover.  For Philly - this seems like the best of the lot.  For betetr Indo-Pak food try Queens NY or North Jersey.\n\nOh - our dessert (Galub - can't spell it) fried cheese balls, was syrupy and friend and just as I rememberfrom the Dipavali festivals I used to attend.  Yum-my.\n\nOh - it's BYOB - so BRING something. (We didn't and wished that we had.)\n\n\nDinner for the 3 of us was $60 even including tax & tip.  Really not bad.",

I have gone to Mizu since it first opened (now there are 3 of them in Philly),  Back then it was dirt-cheap (which always makes me suspicious when dealing with raw, fresh fish) and very, very good.\n\nToday, Mizu offers a limited selection of fish - the basics like tuna, salmon and yellowtail and also standard rolls.  Prices are low to moderate and they give you BIG portions.  A roll is really 1.5 rolls - 12 pieces.\n\nMike, the owner, is rarely ever at the Original 20th Street location - and the sushi bar chefs I used to know well are not there anymore.  I am hopeful they can recapture the service and freshness level they had when they first opened.\n\nIncidentally - they make an excellent Hwe Dup Bop and tasty Gyoza and Shumai are cheap (frozen - not home made).",

Chock full of veggies - napa Cabbage, Carrots, Shredded Snow Peas (so sweet) and Mushroom slivers.\n\nI LOVED IT.\n\nThe $13.95 Chirashi lunch is a steal - a la cart there is a good $20 worth of tuna, salmon, yellowtail, fluke (or some other white fish) and snapper on the plate.\n\nNo 5th star?

I got a take out menu from here in my building and stared at it for weeks before taking the plunge.\n\nLast night I justs DID NOT want to cook, so I ordered food for myself, 5 year old DD and DH (who decided not to eat any).\n\nThe order took 45 minutes to arrive and was wrong when it got here, plus I was charged for 2 $4.99 orders of items I never ordered.  \"Ron \" on the phone has said he will be refunding my credit card, so I am on the lookout for that refund.\n\nMeanwhile the food we did order was good.  Fried dumplings ($4.99 for tem) were crisp and tasty.  $1.00 each for spring rolls (also fried - it was a fried food fiesta) were good too.  Tempura shrimp was stuffed with a SPICY sauce.  Won;t be ordering that again.\n\nThe main dish - Bul gogi was very good, but a bit scant on the meat (but wha'dya want for $7.99).\n\nIn my opinion Goji is much better food, but for take-out this Korean/Japanese hybrid is a great alternative to Chines or Pizza.\n\nWe will order again - next time from \"The Line\".  Or maybe a Bibim Bap.  I loves me a good bap!\n\nIf you are a student and live on take-out - we suggest you give Koja a try.  Just read your receipt!!!!",

A braided, yellow egg roll (like a mini challah bun) appeared, quartered and perfectly buttered.  Alas, my thighs, I ate the carbs!\n\nA delightful inexpensive lunch, served on paper plates, eaten with plastic silverware, in the company of local cops and working folk.\n\nOh - lunch costs $10 bucks exact including tax 'n tip.\n\nPay up front!\n\nI heart Yonni's.",

Service by at least 5-6 uniformed serves was great also.\n\nMy one complaint?  The vegetarian option - penne pasta (Cold and swimming in oil) served with a caponata (way too vinegary) was not to my taste - but others enjoyed it.  I was glad they offered some veg-friendly fare.\n\nBest of all - they use recycled materials wherever possible and are about as \"green\" as a caterer can be!",

The new spa manager is a doll and customer service oriented.  She also wound up doing my make-up because... (area for improvement)...\n\nThey only allowed 30 minutes to do my hair & makeup for the photo shoot.  The (sweet, 23 year old) newbie hairdresser spent over 40 on my hair alone (and it was not what I wanted so she cheerfully re-did it and it was better then).  The 23 year old then had to leave so the manager (Raeleah?  I know I spelled that wrong) jumped in and quickly did my make-up (AWESOME job, By the way( before rushing off to do a waxing client.\n\nThey need to schedule a bit better.\n\nOK, so now I'm all prettied-up and Tommi, Nikki and the Pierre & Carlo owner's wife (can't remember her name) - who I thought was \"just\" a photog assistant - did the shoot.\n\nThey shot for over the promised hour and took over 100 shots.\n\nI am very pleased with the three 8 X 10s (they gave me one extra - the deal was for 2). and the retouching.\n\nTommi is, indeed, a good photographer.  I would consider him for a wedding (but the package prices are high) and am now considering having my child photographed (NOT Boudoir!!!).\n\nFor $119 - this was a great value.  (Hair & Makeup alone can easily run $100.)\n\nI see improvements in Tommi already - so if you were here a few months ago or longer and got \"burned\" consider giving them another try.\n\nI can't wait to test out their pedicure services.  I am STILL on the search for a decent spa pedi in Philly.  (Tierra Mia is the best I've found but soooo expensive and the \"natural\" polish doesn't last and she won't use my toxic OPI from home.)\n\nThe search continues.\n\nMuch love to Tommi & Nikki though - for a wonderful experience.\nIt's not every day that I get naked in front of total strangers.",

My little one got Orange, Pomegranate, Cheesecake and Plain (Tart) Yogurt) and covered it in fruit and candy.\n\nI opted for a small bit of the tart classic plain with come blueberries and 2 mini-cream puffs on top.  The yogurt is so cold it froze the berries!  (The guy behind the counter - who is a doll and also easy on the eyes! - said than many people opt NOT to put gummy bears nor jelly beans because the yogurt freezes them rock-hard.)\n\nSo anyhow, we like Sweet Ending - sure - and we frequent the Rittenhouse one - but whenever we venture East of Broad and feel a fro-you craving coming on - the little one and I head straight to Tuttti Frutti.\n\nGood stuff.\n\nStick to the Original Plain - it's the best (IMO).",

    "text": "Let's hear it for my 1400th review on yelp.\nWell - here it goes...\n\nI just got back from a delicious lunch at Mixto with a good (vegetarian)  friend of mine.  After we each had a stiff, refreshing Classic Mojito each (and I was beginning to feel the buzz). Our friendly - if a little slow- waiter took our orders.\n\nI had the Plato Vegetariano and my friend had a Salad with Avocado added on top.  Both were fresh and excellent.  I asked them to omit the tostones (green plantains) on my platter and sub maduros (sweet plantains) and thus I had an abundance of maduros to share with my friend.\n\nI also gave him some of the Yucca, black beans and 1/4 of the SCRUMPTIOUS white corn arepa.\n\nWow.  I can not wait to go back.\n\nWhy not 5 stars?  A few reasons - in fact I was dithering between 3 & 4 stars.  Service here is, indeed, weird.  Since we arrive just before noon and the place was dead empty our service was better than it could have been - but I imagine at peak times this place is just NUTS.  They do kind-of check you out upon arrival.  The hostess was icy-cold.  Bus person (male) was very nice.\n\nAlso some might say that there are not enough vegetarian options - you basically can have salads or the plato - and that's it.  Fortunately I loved the plato - that arepa and the maduros were PERFECT.  It aslo had steamed (bland) veggies, yellow rice and a clump of mixed green salad in a tasty sweet dressing.\n\nThe mojios were STRONG and well muddled.  We went back again a few weeks later and had Vanilla and Pasion Fruit mojitos which were, indeed, sweeter but so delicious.  Oh - and the LARGE ($13) really is large.\n\nI can't wait to return.  Again - I'll try for a non peak time. (The weekend madness here is just not for me.)\n\nOh - and they DON'T take reservations unless it's a party of 5 or more.",

    "text": "3.5 stars is probably more accurate - but I am rounding up to 4 because my husband enjoyed it (he says it's better than Alma de Cuba - I disagree) and they were very accomodating to our 7 year old on a bustling Friday night.\n\nAlma de Cuba is also great for its bar and party vibe.  My $9 Classic Mojito was perfect - not too strong (but if you like a strong drink you might not agree).\n\nVaca Frita, Ropa Vieja, Maduros, Chicken Empanada (a little small) and Classic Bean Beans & Rice were all they way \"they are supposed to be\".  Excellent Food, a bit high priced for cuban.\n\nBetter than Mixto, not quite as good (nor as pricey/trendy/hoity-toity) as Alma de Cuba (IMHO).\n\nGo and enjoy.\n\nRyan - our server was cordial and attentive.  A great guy!\n\nMany thanks to Alma de Cuba for participating in Friends Select School's Dining with Friends program.  We hope many people will come here!",
