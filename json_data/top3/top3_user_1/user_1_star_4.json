    "text": "OK, the hot Aussie bartender is still there (Big plus.) but a few things have changed.  3 of us had dinner at Xochitl on sunday night.\nWe were made to wait until about 7:20 (at the crowded bar) for our 7 PM reservation.  Not a huge deal, since I was intent on ordering Dona Florindas.\n\nWell, they changed the way they make them and now they use apricot infused tequila instead of pineapple infused tquila - but hot bartender made me one old school.  TERRIFIC.\n\nThe 3 of us each ordered the Sunday Special - 3 courses plus Guac for the table for $35.00.  It was a ton of food - and a good value.\n\nThe table-side guac was top of the line, as usual.  So delicious.  Once we ate it and had our apps (I had a fresh and sublime shrimp cocktail with jicama and mango) we were too full for the entrees.  I enjoyed my skirt steak with unique \"Avocado fries\".  My friend special ordered a mixed grill and did not like it.  I felt bad for her.\n\nMeanwhile, DH had the pork and enjoyed it.  I never eat pork, but it looked well prepared.\n\nSince I was so full - I ate about 3 bites (yummy, tender, succulent bites) of the steak and had it boxed to go.  We still had dessert coming and I was jonsin' for churros.  Well, they came out burnt.  Such a shame - as we had eaten them twice before.  DH had the chocolate cake which was rich and delectable and came with a Cajeta ice cream.\n\nAll 3 of us had the Mexican Hot chocolate - and I like Xochitl's version even  better than the Aztec one at the Naked Chocolate Cafe.  (Nakeds is too spicey for me.)\n\nSo it wasn't quite the 5 star experience that we had on the 2 prior visits - but it was still very, very good.  It just kinda feels like (maybe its the economy, maybe it's just a factor of restaurant age) service and food quality are slipping a little.\n\nDon't get sloppy, Xochitl.  We're counting on you for a 5 star visit when we return.\n\nAnd I will return (not sure about my friend though.).",

(All delicious - miso, cilantro oil, mayo, red wine reduction)\n\n3 pieces of yellowtail sashimi (one order) and one temaki (hand roll) and I was stuffed.\n\nI shall return - happily, now!",

What a fabulous find in a Girard Ave. location.\nWe enjoyed our dinner here very much!\n\nI had a Pineapple Strawberry Daiquiri (BYO Booze) and some amazingly good ceviche - shrimp and tillapia.\n\nMy husband's chicken enpanadas were so good, too (I got a bite!).\n\nFor entrees he had a tender and flavorful shredded pork with super-fresh corn tortilla black refried beans and rice. He liked it alot.  I really loved the Eggplant Tower - a great vegetarian (NOT VEGAN - it's overloaded with 2 kinds of cheese) choice served over white rice and a home-made tomato & onion sauce.\n\nDesserts are very well done here, too at $6-$6.50 each we tried the banana crepes and cheesecake bunuelos.\n\nDelicioso! We can't wait to come back (The crab & shrimp enchiladas and Carne Azada are calling to me.)! They also do weekend brunch - which sounds marvelous.\n\nService by our sweet cambodian server (He's a doll!) was attentive and great.\n\nAnd a big thanks to Eversave (the groupon knock-off) without whom I never would have tried this place.\n\nA super-great find!",

The caprese salad was not the best - it was served with iceberg lettuce (who does that??) and was swimming in low-grade olive oil. For $5 on happy hour it was fine.  Normally it's $8.50 and I would not order it again. (Which is a shame because I love a good caprese.)\nBartender was cute and very personable also.\n\nDinner was better - we were seated right away (dining room was only about 1/4 full) and our (young, pretty) server was perfectly fine.\n\nFood was actually great - veal with spinach and crab-meat served with al dente fettuccine.  Large portion so I took 1/2 home.  My friend had veal parm - which looked average.  (Veal was deep fried underneath the sauce and cheese. Chocolate mousse cake was OK for dessert but the cappuccino was Excellent.\n\nI can certainly understand why some don't like it here as there are many unprofessional chinks in the Spasso armor.  The dining room below the chair rail MUST be re-painted.  It is a deep brown color and everywhere a chair has bumped there is a white chip out of the paint (looks bad).

So much so that Anna Maria set out Diet Cokes for my parents before the car was even parked.\n\nShe knows us all by name.\nSo the service is always 5 star.\n\nThe food is good - solid Pizzeria staples and cheese-steaks.  Deliciously garlicky garlic knots (with chucks of garlic - you will need to brush after wards!) and fresh salads.  The cheese on the caprese is fresh and wonderful.  \n\nPortions are generous.\n\nWe love it here and return over and over.\n\nPlus - Anna Maria gives us mini canolli for dessert.\nWow!",

    "text": "A close female friend and I dined at Stella tonight.\nThe weather was sublime and we sat inside - but right by the LARGE open floor to ceiling windows - so we had the best of both worlds - inside and al fresco.\n\nWe BOTH ordered a plate of the special app - a gloriously fresh mozzarella and heirloom tomato (yellow, orange, red, brown and purple) salad.  It was lightly and PERFECTLY dressed with a basil infused oil and a sweet balsamic (decent quality - not the cheap stuff, but not the 17 year old either).  It sang on the palate.\n\nI am hankeing to try the meatball and risotto app - next time.   (And there WILL be a next time.)\n\nNext we split a pizza.  Let me preface this by saying that I am not (shocking, I know) a pizza lover.  I am a pasta lover, but never really \"get off\" on pizza.  \n\nStella's pizza is very, very good.  (My friend says it's better than Osteria - but the pie she had as Osteria was burnt.)  Thin crust - but not ridiculously thin.  (I dislike \"pizza on a cracker\")  Thin in the middle and medium rise (with some puffiness) on the edges.  We had #11 - Spinach.  It was a white pie with a healthy hit of garlic, toasted pine nuts (Oh, yeah, baby!!), the ideal amount of fresh, bright green, sauteed spinach, and a few heavy handed spinkles (globs?) of a sundried tomato/oil puree.  Definitely tasty - and worth a try for those of you who like spinach.\n\nOne negative?  No substitutions on pie.  They make 'em how they make 'em.\n\nOne positive?  GREAT service by our your server (can not remember her name - but she was really nice and attentive.)\n\nAnother thing... only gelatos for dessert.  We skipped dessert here and opted to get some home-made cakes at \"More than Just Ice Cream\".  But I bet their gelato is good.  (However, Capogiro is not too far, ya know...)\n\nAnyhow - Starr strikes again with a good (and not overly decorated - thank goodnees) spot.\n\nNote to the hard-working pie men (and gals):  Please keep the pies crispy on the bottom - nobody likes a soggy pie.\n\nJOB WELL DONE.\n\nOh - another thing - we really wish you'd take reservations.  Thankfully at 5:30 on a May Sunday we (2 people) did not need one and were seated quickly.  Hooray!",

I had the short rib torta and it was BIG (Huge, and messy - definitely NOT a date night food.), but more importantly it was Excellente!\n\nThe braised beef shortrib was tender, yet charred (they do this at the end for presentation) and tasted so flavorful and succulent with just the right amout of fat to taste great but not too fatty.\n\nThe sauce - made of guajillo (sp??) peppers and tomato, really tasted like tomato sauce to me - but what do I know?  The best part?  A FRESH - I mean uber-fresh - baked roll - almost like a mexican \"fat\" baquette with a crunchy crust and a white, airy inside.  (Yes, I know trop carbs, but who cares when the Bread is shipped in from Parc!!!)\n\nThey even re-did the back bar as a swanky faux speak-easy.\n\nYes, it's pricey - but I bet if you order the right things you can have a 4 star night easily at El Rey.\n\nOh - and even though the place is blaringly-loud - it's still less noisy than Distrito - but I gotta say - Distrito's food still ROCKS my world.\n\nI shall return.

The atmosphere and vibe were perfect on a busy Friday evening.\n\nCocktails for Happy Hour (4 - 6:30 PM) are a great value at $8.  For $13.25 - not so much.  I had a Cucumber Gin/White Cranberry concoction and it was refreshing and enjoyable.\n\nThe food was just OK.\nThe highlight for me were the $4.75 brussels sprouts - I got them sans bacon and they were perfectly roasted and wonderful.  \n\nThe salad I chose was where things fell short.  I ordered the heirloom tomato and mozzarella salad (a dish I have had at many places, prepared in many different ways).  The \"herb crust\" on the mozz just ruined it.  (And I could tell is was good, quality mozz underneath.)  Also the tomatoes.  The small, mulit-colored tomoatoes were fine - but the thickly sliced green tomato (the \"meat\" of the dish\") was over ripe and mushy.\n\nIck.\n\nMy friend got (what I was thinking of getting and should have gotten) the veggie sampler for $15.50.  Next time (if it is still available) I will get that.  The black bean taco and roasted tofu looked great.\n\nSo 3 star food and 5 star service/decor equals about 4 stars.\nPretty darned good for a chain.",

    "text": "Well, my husband & I finally tried this place - we've driven by a bunch of times but never went.  And we would consider returning (although Shiroi Hana is more convenient for us - and lately I've been really into Vic's.)\n\nThe place was nearly empty at 5:30 on a Friday.  The hostess asked if we had a reservation and we told her that we did not.  She made a negative face so I asked her if that was a problem (The place was empty except for one male couple lingering - and they were there before we got there AND after we left.).  She said no and seated us.\n\nI stopped by the sushi bar to bow to the chef and take a peek at the fish.  Looked good.  Chef recommended the Red Snapper and O-Toro.  \n\nWe started with an order ($3.00) of Pork Wasabi Shumai.  - 2 large shumai.  Tasty and very wasabi-ish.\n\nMy husband ordered a bowl of udon (very tasty dashi broth) a spicy tuna roll which he loved, and a negi-hamachi roll which was just OK.\n\nI got a special roll (Jay roll?) with rice \"pops\" on it - good but I did not care for the spicye-level of the tuna filling.  It was too hot for me.  (And I had asked for it mild.)  I bet if you are a spicy lover you'd like the rolls here.\n\nTuna was fresh - but not the yellowtail.  Also my $6.00 piece of O-Toro was gristley and GROSS.  What a shame.  Toro should be a mouth-gasm and this was not.\n\nThe best sushi I got was the Inari stuffed with chopped tuna (spicy tuna - this time WAS made mild) and garnished with chunks of avocado and a few pine nuts.  The pine nuts really made it so special.  I would DEFINITELY get that again.\n\nFor dessert we had the green-tea icecrem filled mochi which was very good.\n\nOh - and they do NOT make their own tamago - it's frozen - so we did not order any.",

I have only been here twice and both times (with my parents, of course - who LOVE the fresh mozzarella salad and prime-rib (or is it filet) beef sandwiches.\n\nThe first time we went my daughter was a wee 6 or 7 months old and I was in a post-partum haze.  The experience was a drag from soup to nuts.  (Nevermind that we did not order any soup nor nuts).  Mom ordered and raved about her fresh (and milky white) mozzarella and tomato salad.  Dad was in red-meat heaven.\n\nStrangely enough we never actually get any beer here.  (The 'rents don't drink it.)\n\nThen little angel-pie decided to pee in her diaper.  So I had to change her diaper.  And things got ugly.  There was NO WHERE - and I mean no where to change her.  The ladies room was a one-person operation with NO changing tabel and no area.  The floow in there seems icky.\n\nSo I whipped out my portable changing pad (waterproof) and tried to subtley and quickly change her on a tabletop in the back hallway.\n\nI was immediately yelled at by a (male) manager to stop.  I basically ignored him - as I was nearly done anyway) and finished wiping the babies butt, threw the dirty things in a plastic baggie, threw the baggie backinto my diaper bag and went back to the table.\n\nI was so ticked off.  I mean, what was I supppsoed to do - there was NO WHERE to change this kid.  A 6 month old baby.\n\nWhatever.\n\nSo anhow - thety have great food and a terrific selection of salads - but don't bring a non-potty trained kid here.  (In our case an infant.)\n\nRant over.",

While I must admit to liking Qdoba a tad more - Chipotle is my go-to place for a Burrito Bol (Naked Burrito) with Chicken, Black Beans and Guacamole.\n\nIt's fast and cheap - but watch those calories - I never get cheese and rarely get sour cream so I can justify that guac!\n\nThis branch of Chipotle is in a stand-alone building (did it used to be the Pizza Hut - I forget).  It has a cool-gray ambience - a bit industrial looking.  We usally get take out, though so we don't really care.\n\nOn the Sunday afternoon when we last visited, the place was loaded with families with young children.",

My Eggs Benedict (California - with Avocado and a slice or tomato instead of Canadian Bacon) was delicious. Came with slightly bland and slightly underdone hash-browns.  Plenty of food for $9.95. Friendly service - and you pay at the front.\n\nIt was jam-packed at precisely 12 noon on a Wednesday - so come earlier if you can.\nParking is also a drag - but the end result is worth it.\n\nSit on the patio under an umbrella if the weather permits.\n\nNICE!",

    "text": "We celebrated our 3rd wedding anniversary at JAI last night - and the weather and scenery were PERFECT.  We come back to the JAI (where we were married on 06/07/08) every year on our anniversary for dinner.  the past 2 years we brought our DD and both sets of parents.\n\nThis year it was just us and our DD who is now 6.\nShe had a delicious lobster mac 'n cheese with smoked Gouda.\nShe also ate one of my 4 lamb rib chops which were divine.\nShe also had 3 bites of my husbands salmon which was perfectly cooked.  (All that stuff was 5 star).\n\nHere's the bad part - HIGH salt content for sides and sauces.  My sauteed mushrooms were so salty I had to say something and send them back.  Inedible.  They promptly cooked another (only slightly less salty) batch which I took home - and may toss.\n\nDH's salmon was on a bed of soba noodles drowning in a sweet/salty sauce that, too, was over-salted.\n\nWhat a shame.\n\nMeanwhile the apps wre AWESOME - some of the best sweet potato fries we've ever tried (and we try them at lots of places) .  Served with a warm marshmallow \"fluff-like\" dip.  HEAVENLY.\n\nThe smoked duck tostada was great, too.  (If a bit on the smokey side.  Yes, it is very smokey indeed.)\n\nDessert coffees at $8.50 are a delcious indulgence - topped with a cloud of REAL whipped cream.  Chocolate covered strawberries (call ahead to speacil order these) are LARGE, plump, red, sweet and juicy coated in luscious chocolate.\n\nWe love it here - and got to watch the end of a Saturday wedding and the rehearsal for a Sunday wedding.  Lots of weddings, showers and events are held here - and we know why - it's a GREAT venue for events.  (And now they can accomodate a larger wedding in the expanded ballroom.)\n\nWe love ya, Tegue & Neil!  Best regards to Wendy, too.  See you in June 2012.",

All of a sudden our table was ready!  (So great - because we were hungry by then - and the wait was only about 8 minutes!)  In future I would recommend reservations for Friday or Saturday nights here - the summer Gay Street scene is pretty hoppin'.\n\nThe tables are pretty close together (we sat outside on a lovely night) so we got to know a couple from Atlanta next to us.  Everything they ordered and everything we ordered looked amazing. We enjoyed our drinks - I had an $8 Kir Royale and DH had a Belgium Raspberry lambic that smelled and tasted so sweet and fruity (you better like fruit!) that even I could have easily drank it.\n\nOur proscuitto and melon app - at $13 - was 5 star perfection.  The large ball of creamy fresh Mozzarella (di Buffala!!!) was divine.  It was served with 2 slices of panini-pressed bread that was good for dipping into the lemon-noted olive oil on the plate.\n\nDH & I both ordered pasta as our main dish - mine was a special of pappardelle (house made - and a little on the thick side but perfectly cut and cooked to a toothsome al dente) with shrimp (5 medium sized ones) and lumps of crab meat (sweet, shell-less and delectable).  DH had the penne a la vodka and I did not taste it but it looked great, too.\n\nWe shared a delicious creme brulee (the top was stll warm from being blow-torched) for $8.\n\nCappuccino (at $5 - ouch!) was a let down.  Extremely bitter tasting and I fear the beans were burnt.  I could only drink a few \n\nThey are sooooo close to 5 stars on food - but there are a few areas for improvement that are holding me out on the 5th star. (Fix your ladies room stall doors and the lights on the stars, please!)  Food snobs from NYC or Philly may shun the 'burbs - but Teca was a big winner for me last night.\n\nWe'll be back - hopefully soon - to see if they can keep it up.\n\nOh - and I wanna buy a bottle of that olive oil that is supposedly pressed at the owner's place in Italy.

    "text": "Ok, here's the deal.  If you're going on somebody else's dime - do it!  It is really high-priced for faux-pub - but I gotta say they do a few things there really, really well.\n\nFor instance, one of my dining companions is from England and ordered a Bomdardier which he said was well poured and not \"too fizzy\".  It was however, served much cooler than you'd get back home.\n\nMy entree of Hake was delicious served in a buttery lemon caper sauce over a small bed-ette (to small to call it a bed) of kale.  Not dry - in fact it leaned toward the underdone side - and thus was tender and large-flaky.\nI also enjoyed the cold poached shrimp (5 for $14 - large ones) with lemon mayo & cocktail sauce.  Simple - but so tasty!\n\nDesserts are not a strong suit save for the hot chocolate pot. (worth the 15 minute wait - order this with dinner if you are in a rush). Skip the Eton Mess unless you like TART fruit.\n\nMy decaf cappucino (not listed on the menu - but ask and ye shall receive) was EXCELLENT.  Try a Pimms Deluxe (or a classic Pimms cup) for a refreshing treat. Oh - and they have (for $5.50 each - OUCH) fancy-schmancy organic bottled sodas from the UK - I had a Luscombe's Sicilian Lemonade that was great and worth the 134 calories of sugar-water.  (THat's ORGANIC sugar water to you!).  And they carry Ribena (a blast from the past!).\n\nI may be back - but for the price point, I'll be waiting a while.\nOh - and I won't be missing Mantra!",

I agree - gives Corropolese a run for their money.  Meanwhile, today I tried a panini (on an enormous Ciabatta loaf) with pork, sharp provolone and broccoli rabe.  Asked for a bit of sauce on it - PERFECT.  This is amazing.\n\nMy friend had a small (still plenty) sausage and pepper sandwich/sub/hoagie and it was old-school and very tasty according to her.\n\nJeanne-Marie (sp?) our server was friendly and wonderful but way overworked - she was serving 2 full dining rooms at the lunch rush by herself.

Next time (if I get that item) I will ask if they can do it with grilled chicken.\n\nSteamed spinach (by request) was perfect and I am glad I asked because one colleague's meal came with sauteed spinach which he said was loaded with salt and oil.\n\nPlease folks, ease up on the fatty foods and we will return much more quickly.\n\nThanks!",

Bet that comes in handy on crowded nites - but it was DEAD at 6 PM on that particular Sunday.\n\nWe started with a DELICIOUS order of chicken nachos and they were served with blue corn tortilla chips, salsa, guacamole and a good amount of melted cheese.

    "text": "We went to Indonesia last night as part of the foodie group (Shout out to Foodie M!) of 31 people.  For $35 (including tax & tip - BYOB) per person we had an absolute banquet of food. 2 Diet Cokes we ordered in addition were less than $3.00.  Dang - I should brought some bubbly!\n\nOur hosts (the owner and 2 attentive, hard working servers) treated us so well.  We had the entire private banquet room upstairs, and it was lovely, with fresh flowers on the long table, and ice water ready for us.\n\nOur appetizers were balls of sticky rice stuffed with aromatic chicken, wrapped in a banana leaf.  (The banana leaf is used prevelantly in Javanese cookery).  I liked it, but it coulda used some dipping sauce.\n\nNext we had a choice of soup - Chicken with coconut - different than Thai - and a little thinner - or an EXCELLENT Lamb soup.  The soup did have bones (lamb ribs) in it - so that turned a few people off - but I loved it - as the flavor was so tasty.  Lime leaves and lemon grass - and not at all \"too hot\" nor \"too spicy\".  I really, really enjoyed that soup.\n\nAfter the appetizer and soup I already felt full, but I tried to pace myself (and failed) for the formidable feast.  Each couple was served a lazy susan with about 6-7 different dishes on it.  Large bowls of yellow aromatic rice (so delish) were placed on each table so we could all have as much rice as we liked.  (The rice had a faint jasmine tea aroma to it and was so sweet and wonderful. - Carbo loading at its best.)\n\nThe dishes on our lazy susan included a succulent and tender beef curry.  Now, I am not a curry person - but this was terrific.  A lovely \"barbequed\" chicken in a sweet red pepper sauce was fragrant and tasty.\n\nAll the meats were flake-tender.\n\nI was not a big fan of the mackerel - again steamed with spices and wrapped in the ever-present banana leaf.  It tasted too fishy and cat-foodish for me.\n\nThe Udup-Udup - mixed vegetables with FRESH crispy bean sprouts and crunchy green cabbage was a good palate cleanser.\n\nFettucine-like strands of egg omelette were simply delicious as well.\nNasi goreng and Sate (yummy chicken sate) were on the platter, too.\n\nAnother stand out was the crisp, slightly sweet and calorie-laden corn & egg fritter.  Two of them were perched atop the center of the lazy susan and DH and I ate those right away while they were hot and perfect.\n\nBy now I was so full I could barely try the tempeh with shrimp and green beans (sounded better than it was) and Potato-meat croquettes (not my thing, but other people loved them).\n\nNot one but 2 dessert courses followed.\nFried bananas - one of my favorites - were served with a small pitcher of syrup.  \"They're not just for breakfast anymore\"!  The batter evokes a french toast (sans cinnamon) taste.  They were a little thickly breaded (I am accostomed to Japanese Tempura bananas) for my liking - but I was so stuffed that I really didn't mind.\n\nThe final dessert was really. Well.\n\nWeird.  It was a warm \"soup\" of sweet (slightly chalky) coconut milk, with pieces of (yummy) jackfruit), tapioca pearls, mung beans, shredded green jello (eeeew) and pieces of white bread.\n\nMaybe it was because I was now too full to enjoy anything - but this type of dessert (take every tpical Javanese dessert item and put it in a bowl) would not ever be my cup of tea.  (Or soup - as the case may be.)\n\nThe best part of the evening was the terrific conversation and friendships made.  Foodie M.'s mom and sister sat near us - and that was terrific.\nWe also met another couple who were smart and funny and had been to Indonesia before (Though Balinese cuisine and easter Javanese are quite different.)\n\nI would highly recommend trying Indonesia and supporting this wonderful local business.\n\nA great time was had!",

    "text": "OK, I gotta update my review of OOKA, as we just had an incredibly GOOD night here.  Our first time coming with our 4 (nearly 5) year old and sitting at the teppanyaki grill. (No, it's not Hibachi.  It's teppanyaki, thank you very much.)\n\nWe made a same day reservation for 6:45 PM on a Saturday (tonight, actually) and were accomodated and got in just before it started to get packed & crazy - as Saturday nights at Ooka D-town are known to be.\n\nService was truly excellent.  The waiter and teppanyaki chef were both extra accomodating to the little princess - the chef even made an extra Onion Volcano during the teppanyaki grilling portion.  She was mesmerized.\n\nThe place had an unusually high number of kids and families - I guess I never noticed this before because every ogther time we have come sans bebe (thank god!) and usually we sit in the sushi dining room or at the sushi bar.\n\nOnce again I ordered the Seared striped bass with foie gras suishi and once again it was melt-in-your-mouth delicious.  Next time 2 orders!  It's that good. \n\nToro was a bit of a disappointment (but at only $7.00 I had to try one).  I also ordered 2 pieces of Maguro ($5.50 for 2 pieces vs. $7 for ONE toro - they said \"O\" but I bet it was \"Chu\".)  Anyhow the toro was a little gristley and the Maguro was perfect.  Next time I'll be skipping the toro and loading up on Hamachi (perfect and ocean-fresh) and the aforementioned seared bass with foie.\n\nDD & DH had teppanyaki meals -which are never a HG for me.  DD loved her shrimp, noodles and rice.  She wouldn't touch the veggies.\nHubby ate his chicken meal but said (as predicted) it was too heavy on the soy and the margarine (yes they slather that grill in grease).\n\nBringing kids?  The teppanyaki will keep them very entertained.  Want a better meal?  Order sushi based dishes.  (Just my opinion.)\n\nGo Ooka.  What a change from the Domino's pizza and ultra-conservative Christian Bookshop that used to inhabit the space.",

We were crammed in like sardines).\n\nThe tables were pre-set with salad (romaine with dill dressing - quite tasty), bread, pita and hummus (yum!).\n\nEntrees and dessert platters were served family style.  Food was delicious and excellent - especially the Branzino over \"greek-style\" roasted veggies - potato, zucchini, eggplant, peppers) - all were terrific.\n\nPasta alla Greca is an inexpensive way to feed a crowd.  Tasty - but too light on the spinach, IMHO.\n\nDeseert of a very nutty baklava (good but not the best I've tried) and a moist bordering on wet-with-syrup walnut cake.  People either loved it or hated it - I enjoyed it, but it is WET and very, very, cloyingly sweet.\n\nNote:  They have a private wine room for dining up tpo 14 people.\nI sense a party in my future at ESTIA!\n\nGreat for pre/post theatre, too.  They know how to get you in and out.",

Crab Cocktail here is a treat!\n\nDinners included filet mignon, ribeye (overly sauced, for my taste - but the guys liked it), lobster roll (very good but not better than Cape Cod) and crab/lobster stuffed \"sachetti\" pasta.\n\nEnjoyable desserts like fried donuts, creme brulee (yum) and buttermilk ice cream (very good).\n\nKudos to the chef and servers.",

Hwever, the salmon sushi (nigiri) we ordered was fresh and tast.\n\nThe \"rich man\" roll ($13) is basically a souped-up spicy salmon roll topped with MORE salmon.  I got the 2 sauces (A sweet mango syrup/sauce and eel sauce) on the side which was a good move.\n\nKiddo got a rainbow roll sans \"fake crab\" kani stick.  She hates fake crab.  Smart kid.  $11.\n\n\"Regular\" rolls are $5.25 - and for that I'd just as soon get 2 Alaskan rolls for less that the cost of the \"rich man\".  Dessert ($4.50) was an overly greasy tempura banana.

Home-made Mozz - so creamy; A drizzle of \"the good stuff\" - aged balsamic; red, ripe, roma tomatoes; basil chiffonade.  SUPERB.\n\nThe lasagna was so rich I almost could not eat it.  (Although others I know would swoon over this.)  An excellent meaty bolognese - but the creamy sauce on top was just too much.  Delicate house-made pasta sheets.  Topped with a fried egg that was, alas, oddly cooked (Thus precluding me from awarding LaPorta the fifth star).  The egg was, indeed, fried = the bottom was actually crispy and brown - the top?  Raw.  Not runny (which I like) but raw albumin over the yolk.  Slimy.  Not good.\n\nMeanwhile the 2 pizzas our  table tried (Malfatta - neat! and a classic Margarita) were excellent.\n\nLots of love and care goes into this food and it shows.\n\nLOVE IT and will return soon.  But I'll try other things (like the salads which sound great) that are not quite so rich and heavy.\n\nGorgeous bar area and a rustic older dining room, too.\nLizzy - our server - and a brand-spankin'-new bus boy were pleasant and friendly.\n\nGood job, Peter!!!!!\nWelcome to suburbia.",

If you are a fan of fresh mozz - you must try it here.\n\nWe had the special salad of the day - a summery mix of lettuce, fresh burratta (decadent) red and golden beets and sliced peaches.  LOVELY.  The blackberry balsamic was perfect for it.  I added shrimp to mine (which made the $13 salad go to $20).\n\nI really do enjoy the food here.",

    "text": "It will be hard to write a captivating review without re-stating many of the sentiments already expressed below, but I shall try...\n\nLast night we went to Buddakan Philadelphia (there are now 3 locations) which is celebrating 11 years in operation.  Surprisingly, even after living in Philly for nearly 4 years and trying tons of restaurants, this was our first visit.  Years back we visited and peeked inside to see the amazing Golden Buddha and the waterfall wall fountain. I had read the menu many times on the website - so I felt like I knew what to expect.  (N.B. they will be CHANGING the drink menu and dinner menu in a few weeks - finally.)\n\nDecor and Service were easily 5 star, but there are too many small details overlooked for me to give Buddakan that elusive fifth star.  (As Starr restaurants go, this is pretty typical in that there is some over-hyping going on - but for a restaurant like this to survive and thrive for 11 years - an eternity for a restaurant - they are doing alot of things right!)\n\nWe started with $11 - $13 drinks at the nearly empty  bar (from 5:30 - 6:10 on a recession summer Thursday - it got crowded around 8).  The enlightenment was too strong with tequila for me to drink, so I sent it back and tried the tickled pink which was cloyingly sweet and the Malibu rum was not a great idea.  Oh well.  Meanwhile the ASIAN MOJITO was well-balanced, with freshly muddled mint, a hint of ginger and delicious.  (NOTE:  THey are changing the drink menu in a few weeks - many of these cocktails have been on the menu for years and it's all gonna change.)\n\nNext the 3 of us sat at a great table on the main level (there is also a cute bar upstairs and more tables.).  One of us is a vegan and there are very few vegetarian options (and NO vegan apps! The edamame ravioli uses chicken stock)  He had vegetable fried rice (or could have had noodle dishes or the house salad.)  If you are a vegan - this is not a great place for you - unless you just want some drinks.\n\nEverything is served family style with sharing plate s- which for us is great as we all like to share (execpt my vegan friend who, natch, would not eat the fish or duck).  Chicken Dumplings were a step up from the frozen gyoza we get at our favorite sushi joints.  Tasty for sure - but not worth $9.  A scallion pancake topped with shredded shortrib meat was enjoyed by DH but way too salty for my tastes.  A miss at $12.\n\nEntrees were much better.  The miso black cod, that was so famous, lived up to most of the hype.  Perfectly cooked.  I subbed a DELICIOUS eggplant in lieu of the wasabi mashed potatoes.  That eggplant was GREAT - reminiscent of Kung Pao - it was studded with Pine Nuts.  YUM!\n\nDH ordered the thinly sliced duck breast - a bit too well done for me - but I like my duck with a bit more QUACK left in it.  The accompanying Corn Spoon Bread was AWESOME.\n\nDesserts were by far worth the extra calories.  3 people shared the chocolate Bento box ($14 with chocolatey-good 6 selections - easily feeds 3 by itself).  We also got the hot, fried, five-spice & sugar donuts.  Now this is how I wished the churros at Xochitl could be!  WOW!  Five slightly greasy, hot donuts with 3 delectable dipping sauces (well - the cream cheese was too thick to really be called a sauce) including a rich ganache.\n\nA cup of green tea and a Millenum Cocktail (rimmed with Tang - what is with Starr and his obsession with Tang in cocktails???) capped off a lovely early summer dinner.\n\nGreat for special occaisions - and the tab was $180 or so including tip which really isn't bad.  Expensive but not obscene (we spent more on dinner for 2 at Morimoto!!).\n\nI will be back - but maybe just for drinks and dessert!  (HA, HA!)\n\\\nOh - and I must mention our bartender Adele (She's there Thursdays thru Sundays) and our 5 year veteran server Meg who was charming and spot-on with our orders.\n\nOh - and if you want to (we didn't) they will valet park your car for $18.00).\n\nSo close to 5 stars - but not quite.",

I will be generous and give it 4 stars - but my conscious is screaming \"3 stars\".  I reall would like to see them succeed.  The Callohwhill area needs new businesses.\n\nBut 3 of us had a very lovely dinner there last week.  The place was nearly empty - but you can see that the decor (which is lovely) is brand new.  The ladies room was clean and marble-ized and nice.\n\nService was very attentive - some might argue a bit much - as he asked my husband if he'd like to order any bread 3 times.  (I ordered a poori - with Shrimp as an appetizer which was fabulous in all its deep-fried glory).  My husband did not want any bread.\n\nReally.\n\nOur friend who dined with us is FROM India - and he ordered a Chana (can't remember) appetizer which we all enjoyed but it was served on a bed of shredded ice berg lettuce - which would NEVER happen in India.\n\nThe Lamb Curry was tender and mildly spiced.\nThe rice was excellent - as well cooked basmati can be.\n\nI would go back - but again - I am just not an Indian Food lover.  For Philly - this seems like the best of the lot.  For betetr Indo-Pak food try Queens NY or North Jersey.\n\nOh - our dessert (Galub - can't spell it) fried cheese balls, was syrupy and friend and just as I rememberfrom the Dipavali festivals I used to attend.  Yum-my.\n\nOh - it's BYOB - so BRING something. (We didn't and wished that we had.)\n\n\nDinner for the 3 of us was $60 even including tax & tip.  Really not bad.",

    "text": "Let's hear it for my 1400th review on yelp.\nWell - here it goes...\n\nI just got back from a delicious lunch at Mixto with a good (vegetarian)  friend of mine.  After we each had a stiff, refreshing Classic Mojito each (and I was beginning to feel the buzz). Our friendly - if a little slow- waiter took our orders.\n\nI had the Plato Vegetariano and my friend had a Salad with Avocado added on top.  Both were fresh and excellent.  I asked them to omit the tostones (green plantains) on my platter and sub maduros (sweet plantains) and thus I had an abundance of maduros to share with my friend.\n\nI also gave him some of the Yucca, black beans and 1/4 of the SCRUMPTIOUS white corn arepa.\n\nWow.  I can not wait to go back.\n\nWhy not 5 stars?  A few reasons - in fact I was dithering between 3 & 4 stars.  Service here is, indeed, weird.  Since we arrive just before noon and the place was dead empty our service was better than it could have been - but I imagine at peak times this place is just NUTS.  They do kind-of check you out upon arrival.  The hostess was icy-cold.  Bus person (male) was very nice.\n\nAlso some might say that there are not enough vegetarian options - you basically can have salads or the plato - and that's it.  Fortunately I loved the plato - that arepa and the maduros were PERFECT.  It aslo had steamed (bland) veggies, yellow rice and a clump of mixed green salad in a tasty sweet dressing.\n\nThe mojios were STRONG and well muddled.  We went back again a few weeks later and had Vanilla and Pasion Fruit mojitos which were, indeed, sweeter but so delicious.  Oh - and the LARGE ($13) really is large.\n\nI can't wait to return.  Again - I'll try for a non peak time. (The weekend madness here is just not for me.)\n\nOh - and they DON'T take reservations unless it's a party of 5 or more.",

(Does contain dairy so not vegan - and very rich with cream and parmesan cheese thus negating the veggies.)\n\nYou gotta try that soup.\n\nSo delicious.",

Much more space and a bigger, nicer bar area.\n\nFood was great - cheese dip (with chips) never disappoints and shrimp fajitas and Chili Colorado were both tasty.  Pineapple Mojito (I asked for it light on the pineapple so it would not be too sweet) was spot-on!!!\n\nService was good but our one server was a bit grumpy\nBartender was friendly and funny and the lovely 2 hostess-ladies are so sweet whenever we come.\n\nLove me some Gran Rodeo.",

The \"green soup\" - a hot soup with kale, broccoli and other greens, garnished with Parmesan, was delightful (special) and once again, I got the crab eggs Benedict.  Fan-flipping-tastic.  Amanda our server was terrific, too.\n\nIt's worth the wait (and there usually is one on weekends) so bring friends to chat with or a book or magazine and settle it for a leisurely brunch, lunch or breakfast at house.\n\nWe love it.",

Reliable, good, not mind blowing - but the shrimp and beef filled items are very nice.  Our 11 year old just LOVES it here.  Guacamole is very bland - but made fresh.\n\nSalsa tastes more like watery picante sauce.\n\nNot a holy grail but OK for east-coast suburban.  For better Mexican try Dos Gringos in Media.",
