It was 8:30 PM on a weeknight and they had been sitting out all day and thus were stale - as i had thought they might be.  We bought them anyway.  Bad move on our part.

Safe, decent, and best of all if you ask for Lili - you will get a true pick-me up.\nShe knows which meridians to use, and even gave me an auricular (ear) and scalp massage (no oil, no mess).\n\nI am pleasantly surprised.

Ms. Gao (Owner) if you are reading this - if you would spruce up your decor and signage - you could really have a better review from me.  I hear you are a REAL Acupuncture practitioner and that is a great thing.\n\nPlease give your place a makeover, play a little music (so we can't hear the person in the next \"room\") and change the lighting (florescent) and you could really have something.\n\nI will be back to check up on you!!!",

So refreshing.  They also make a REAL \"Dark & Stormy\" that packs a robust gingery punch.  Soooooo good.\n\nMeanwhile, 4 of us lovely ladies had drinks & dinner here last night.  Service was good by the servers, but the bus \"girl\" was too aggressive in removing plates before we were finished.  She got the hint the 2nd or 3rd time we guarded our plates.  \"No, we're not finished quite yet\".\n\nAfter a round of refreshing drinks (best part of the evening for me, anyway), we started with a $3 bar snack of duck liver, spread thinly on 2 crisp toast points.  It was a little gamey.  Would not re-order.\n\nThe best appetizer by far was the gnocchi.  Now I realize the reviews here on that gnocchi are mixed, but we told them light on the oil and it was great.  Served with REAL morel mushroom.  2 of us split one order and another lady had an order all to herself.\n\nHoney & Whiskey glazed petite chicken wings were very tasty, but also small and boney.  (Large portion, small wing size.)\n\n2 of us, myself included, had the tilapia po boy.  My friend loves this sandwich, i  thought it was just OK.  I wanted to try the lobster BLT special, but the night we went (a Sunday there were NO SPECIALS at all.)\n\nQuel Dommage.\n\nAfter our meals, we had a dessert course.  A nice cheese plate came with red grapes, walnuts and 3 generous cheese selections including Morbier and Stilton.\n\nThe rest of the gals shared a chocolate/peanut butter mousse, which was chilled, dense and not at all goopy.  It was served in a perfect circle with a dulce du leche beneath it.  Not too peanutty, but full of milky chocolate flavor.\n\nThe booths are made of a hard wood and look great but are small for a party of 4 and not comfortable.  This can actually help the restaurant to turn tables - as you won't sit too long (ha, ha!).  The bar was packed at 8:30 PM on a Sunday.  Nice to see in this crappy economy.\n\nI will return to P&K but it is not a holy grail. Oh, and it's not cheap.  (but not horrible) $40 each for the 4 of us.\n\nOh, and we love the \"pabbit\" logo - pig/rabbit.  Reminds us of the divided we fail logo where the Democratic Donkey and Republican Elephant are merged.  CUTE.\n\nNice job!  Please don't let it slide.",

They serve Wings, Boneless Wings, Chicken tenders, Fried Shrimp, Quesedillas and Chili along with about 20 different dipping sauces from Mild, Medium & Hot to Suicide and Homicide.  \n\nWe tried the tenders and Buffalo Shrimp (so good, so greasy, so what!) along with the Honey Barbecue and Golden Garlic Parmesan sauces.\n\nAs junk foods go - I am not a \"wing man\" (er, wing woman??) but the shrimp were fresh-fried and so tasty.  They are steps from my home so I bet we'll be back.  My 4 year old just loved the shrimp - to the exclusion of the boneless wings that we ordered for her.  She just wanted to eat shrimp.  Next time we'll get 15!!!\n\nBest for take out - but there are a few small booths and tables.\n\nThe owner, Angela is a sweetie and very hard working.  I sure hope they make it!",

It was also served sans cornichons - a sacrilege - but 3 small french pickles were brought right away (thankfully for no charge) upon request.\n\nThe seafood cocktails - shrimp, crab (2 legs for $18 - ouch) and lobster all were effortless to eat.

    "text": "It took me 4 years to return to Bellini Grill, and I must say that at the Beginning of our evening I had my faith restored, briefly.\n\nA good friend and I enjoyed our meal here but the super-high notes that started our evening gradually sunk lower and lower.  Firstly, the restaurant was very slow - maybe 3 or 4 tables - when we arrived at 6 or 6:15 PM on a Friday.\n\nWe were greeted and our coats were taken.  I immediately noticed that the place looks much differently (and better!) than it did 4 years ago.  Most notable were the painted murals on the ceiling and walls - complete with a \"Caesar-like\" portrait of the owner on the wall.\n\nOne of the specials that night was a shrimp appetizer ($14.95 - ouch!) that fortunately, seemed to justify the high price.  It was outstanding.  I ordered the Caprese Salad with much trepidation.  Winter tomatoes usually disappoint.  Luckily, this Caprese was Excellent - and lightly drizzled with an olive-oil/balsamic/pesto that was bread-dippin' worthy.\n\nThe special fishes that night were Branzino and Sole - so just for kicks I asked - and (as expected) the price was super-high - $41!  I could not order it.\n\nBoth of us ordered veal dishes which both had flaws - but luckily - delicious thinly-pounded tender veal.  My dish came with 2 tiny lumps of succulent crabmeat.  (So after giving one to my friend - I basically got one bite of crabmeat.  Oh well.)  My dish was also drowning in a heavy butter and lemon sauce - that almost seemed like \"Knorr\" Hollandaise from a packet.  I nearly ordered the dish \"Light on the sauce\" and now, I wish I had.  My friend's Veal Saltimboca was great.\n\nBy now, the place was hoppin' - so our service began to suffer.  At $8 - $10 each (and $9 for a single cannoli) we skipped dessert.  I really, really wanted a latte - but they were $5.25 (yikes) - so we both ordered decaf coffees.\n\nFAIL!  My coffee had coffee grounds all over the rim of the mug.  The coffee itself was not hot - and tasted awful.  My friend had to ask for cream multiple times (I had wanted milk, and she cream - but they brought only milk.) At $2.50 percup/mug - we were glad to not be charged for coffee we could not drink.\n\nNote:  This place is a BYO - which I had forgotten, and seems odd given the name (Bellini) is a cocktail.\n\nAlso Note:  They added a 20% \"Service Charge/Gratuity\" without us asking.  In this case, I would have left maybe 18% given the service decline at the end of the evening.  That kind pissed us off. \n\nWhen all is said and done, I would return to Bellini - but I would order dishes lightly sauced and ask more questions before ordering.  I also would NEVER order coffee nor dessert here.  (At my local Italian bakery I can get a small cannoli for $1.75, large for $3.00 - but I am very lucky to live right near one.)",

They did not give us water until we asked.  Many of us had no cutlery nor napkins.  Again, we asked.\n\nSasha - one of our servers, was lovely - but stretched too thin to accommodate all of us, who ordered (partially separate checks) bar items, bar menu items and dinner menu items.  Items and courses sometimes came right away and other orders were lost in the shuffle and never arrived.\n\nMeanwhile, my partner (on the same check) and I shared the $3 Parisienne Gnocchi (Paris is not known for Gnocchi, by the way), the $5 Mac & Cheese (both from the BAR menu) and a $7 side of sauteed brussels sprouts.  All were delicious - but the gnocchi was SWIMMING in butter and I would not order it again.  The brussels sprouts were the high point for me.\n\nOthers at the table had the Quinoa/Ratatouille dinner entree - and the Quinoa was way, way undercooked.  It was crunchy.  Fortunately the ratatouille was excellent.\n\nDecor is sleek & gorgeous (I mean, the place is brand new.) and the food is NOT \"Mariott-era\" hotel fare.\n\nI am pleasantly surprised and plan to return - but I will allow ample time and expect erratic and weird service.",

I walked in at 6 PM on a Tuesday and the place was DEAD - in fact I thought it was closed from the parking lot - but went inside anyway.\n\nNo hostess, no wait staff, EMPTY diningroom - except for an elderly couple slowly eating in a front booth.  The rice platters they were eating looked good so I hung around.\n\nFinally a lovely lady came out and seated me and I told her that I was on a tight time frame.  She said it would be no problem.  Then she disappeared for a long while and then came back and took my order.\n\nThe food - and I love Persian/Iranian food - was just Ok - yes the rice was 5 star stellar - but I paid $30 for a plate of rice and overcooked chicken (in a delicious sauce, though) thighs (Fesenjoon).  The chicken was so dried out and hard.\n\nYick.\n\nMeanwhile the rice (and the crispy/burnt rice on top) was great.\nI also enjoyed the Shirazi (cucmber/tomato/onion salad) but it was drowning in lemon juice and way too oniony.\n\nI wanted to LOVE it here - and many people do, but the slow service, high prices, awful chicken and DATED ancient decor downgrade it for me. And $30 for basically rice and onion salad (no drinks, no dessert).  Other diners got baklava (not sure if they ordered it) but I never got any.\n\nNeeds a service and decor makeover.

Meh.  Fine.  There was ONE cherry tomato and ONE cucmber slice buried at the bottom. Whatever.\n\nNext I got a specialty sushi roll (I can;t remember which one - I think it was the Lotus Inn Roll) that was just OK.  The sushi fish here is just OK.  Not bad and not great.  I also got an order of sake (salmon) sashimi ($6.50 for 3 thin slices) which I never should have gotten.  Meh.\n\nFor $14.95 I expect more than an alaskan roll with a few slivers of Escolar on top.

We had a semi-open bar for 45 minutes - and beer on tap and house red or white wine.  I had the Pinot Grigio which I did not enjoy.  However, the barkeep (a lovely young lady) and hostess were attentive and very, very hospitable keeping everyone's glasses full.\n\nI shoulda had a pint of Harp or Bass.  Oh well.  Next time.\n\nThen we were ushered into a private dining area.  A choice of soup or Salad (this was - in my opinion) the best part of the meal.  The house salad was EXCELLENT - 4 stars easily - perfectly dressed fresh greens, lots of cukes & carrots and 2 perfect cherry tomatoes.  Accomanied by a basket of fresh warm bread.  I succumbed to the Irish Soda Bread with creamy butter.  Sooooo good!  A friend had the potato parmesan soup which looked awesome (and fattening as hell) and she just LOOOVED it.\n\nBut the entree failed me.  We had 4 choices - a burger (looked great), grilled salmon (looked OK - not earth shattering), a big greasy plate of delicious fish and chips (I tasted a friend's fish - which was begging for malt vinegar - a bottle quickly appeared.) - and my entree - the roast chicken.\n\nOr should I say the dessicated chicken?  \n\nThis chicken was so dry and over cooked it was just not enjoyable.\n\nUGH.  OK - Star off for that.\n\nDessert redeemed TNN - with a luscious banana split - with warm caramelized banana halves.\n\nWe had a lovely time and I will return (and maybe even give 'em 4 stars next time) but no WAY would I order the roast chicken EVER again.\n\nOh - you should also know that prior to our dinner - a colleague and I sat on the outdoor patio (we had arrive early) and were given water in FILTHY dirty glasses.

I give a MUCH higher rating to the produce manager.\n\nI had a part and ordered (well in advance) a $59.99 cold cut tray and a $19.99 Chocolate-dipped strawberry tray (excellent and a great value).\n\nThere were many issues with both quality and presentation of the (medium sized) tray.\nI spoke to the manager (LeighAnn) who was gracious and promptly refunded my $60 plus gave me a $10 gift card.  (Very nice to do that!).\n\n5 star customer service - but I would have preferred a 5 star party tray.\nPlease \"step up your game\", Acme Deli.  \n\nI am not likely to order trays from here again.\n\nP.S.  We are still very, very grateful to this Acme for supporting our girl scout troop.  I would like to be supportive of Acme as well.  Sure wish that party tray had been good.",

I settled on a strectch black knit top.  Decent price, too - reduced from 59.98 to 29.98.  SOLD!!!!\n\nNote:  I cam back about 2 weeks later and the tank tops were on sale.

    "text": "OK, I will be nice and cut them a break.  It should be 2 or 2.5 stars, but I am hoping they will work out the kinks and improve.  The menu sounded sooooo wonderful and my friend was keen to try Root - so we went.  The place was dead empty when we arrived, but throughout our meal about 8 people were dining.  Definitely BYO something - they have NOTHING to drink but water.\n\nTurns out this is the site of the former Palate BYOB.  I guess they just couldn't make it.\n\nThe food is really not great.  (Which is a shame because they claim to use sustainable and local ingredients and I strive to support it.  The tattoo-covered chef and the server (a nice gal) were hospitable.\n\nHere's what made the food more like 2 stars.  I started with the poached shrimp salad.  It came with 2 large, overcooked a bit rubbery shrimp.   The greens were shredded and appeared to be romaine and napa cabbage in a tangy vinaigrette.  The drizzle of (good quality) balsamic around the plate edge was good.\n\nNow the strange entree.  (We skipped dessert  -  didn't want to chance it.)  I ordered the rabbit and oxtail raviolo with uni cream.  The Oxtail was the best part - rich, and meaty with a delicious flavor.  The rabbit really did taste like dark meat chicken.  And the sauce was heavy - but tasty.  Here's a the bad part - the crepes were heavy as lead.  Kinda like a cross between home-made paste (flour & water) and Bisquick.  Really strange.  Not deelicate at all, and certainly not like pasta - more like a home-made leaden buscuit that fell flat.\n\nIt's really a shame.  I am hoping they can figure it out - and they really, really need A/C or at least a few more fans.\n\nSadly I am not one of them...",

I did not stay overnight here so I can't comment on the rooms.\n\nMeanwhile, I attended a nice corporate event here last night (with dinner included) and a colleague drove - so he knew exactly where it was - BUT even he mentioned that the signage is weak and it's very hard to find this place if you don't know where to look.\n\nWe started with drinks at the lobby bar.  I had a fairly weak and not too spicey 3 star Bloody Mary.  It came with a slice of lemon and when I asked the female bartended (very sweet lady) for celery she said they did not have it.\n\nOK.  Points off for that.  If you want a kickin' Bloody Mary by the way - try Bar North Third. but I digress...  Mmmn.  Now  I want a bloody mary.\n\nOK.  Next it was off to the dinner/meeting.  The tables were pre-set with very warm butter (had been sitting out for quite some time).  The immediately plated chilled caesar salads that were very good - basic and crisp.  Not overly dressed.  The rolls were hot - which was a nice touch.\n\nMy entree - wild mushroom ravioli - was very tasty - and looked much better that the chicken marsala (1/2 a semiboned breast with a wing drumette attached - looked very banquet - and ONE mushroom.)\n\nI was glad I did not order the chicken - but people ate it and seemed 3 -4 star happy.\n\nDessert was a moist carrot cake garnished with a single wilted strawberry.  All in all - things could have used a bit more polish and freshening up.\n\nService was very efficient - a bit too \"hurry up and let the staff leave\" for my taste.\n\nCoffee was fresh and very yummy.\n\nMeeting rooms was nice - standard hotel corporate stuff.\n\nI have a feeling I'll be back for future events here.",

Service was good - friendly and courteous.\n\nHe had the (last one) \"Blue Plate\" special - a crabcake (one) and salad.  I chose the heirloom tomato salad with (one lump of) burrata and an EXCELLENT balsamic and EVOO drizzle.\n\nWe split an order of WAY OVERCOOKED duck fat fries.  Awful.  Greasy.  Salted.  Burned.  Mess.\n\nMy first bite of the salad was of a red tomato and it was rotten.\nThankfully the rest of the salad was perfect.\n\nThe food is so close to being \"as good as it gets\" - in theory - but the puny portion size (my male colleague needed the fries as the crabcake plate was app sized.), rotten tomato bite and charred fries soured our experience. The burrata was the \"real deal\".  The ingredients are all great - they just need better execution.\n\nMeanwhile, our male server was cheerful and terrific.\nHe even took the fries off the check.  ($40 for lunch for 2 - no apps, no dessert, no booze).\n\nGarces - I love ya - but JG needs some tweaking, please.",

While I love and heartily endorse the concept of \"natural\", \"green\", and \"Organic\" nail treatments, I have not found the water based polishes/top/base coats to be long lasting.\n\nI was assured that Karina's technique is unique and long lasting, that said\nthe services by Karina here are second to none, and organic and in a GREEN environment.\n\nMeanwhile a simple polish change (called a Mimos) was heavenly in there one and only high-end \"Sound therapy\" chair - quite possibly the best pedi chair I have ever sat in.  You can tell Karina and her fiance have spent a bundle on equipment, products (Rich Hippe/Nature Girl is pricey stuff!) and renovating the space (Clay walls!!).  They have done a great  (and green) job.\n\n\nNow for the bad news...\n\nThe icy-cold receptionist made me feel as though I was not trustworthy and she followed me around the salon, fearful that I would rip off a bottle of polish.\n\nThis tainted my experience in an extremely negative way.\n\nI may or may not return.  Next time for a complete ritual.  perhaps now the receptionist won't be so nervous that I might steal products.  That really hurt.\n\nNote: The day after my Mimos we went for our vacation in Cape Cod - the sun, salt & surf turned my sheer pink pedi - YELLOW within 48 hours. Sickly, ugly yellow.  Another example of how inferior the water-based top coats are.  I miss my CND and OPI.  I wonder if Karina would let me bring my own products and have her apply them? \n\nMama ain't too happy with the end results of this polish change!",

It was a Saturday during the afternoon.\n\nThis place is really neat - but it's more like a club-slash-bowling alley.\n\nIt is NOT where I would have a kids party - but surprisingly it all worked.  The adults had drinks and lots of fried-bad-for-you apps.\nThe kids ate a grocery-store cake that they brought and Lucky Strikes made little cheese pizzas for each kid.\n\nThey did not have any milk for my 3 year old so she got all sugared up on a big glass of OJ.\n\nDudes, this is not a kids place.  A sweet sixteen (like Rumer Willis - allegedly had at the Lucky Stikes in LA) maybe - but not a freakin' five year old.",

Yes, really.)\n\nMeanwhile, It was not crowded on a Tuesday evening, but I bet there's a big wait on Saturdays.\n\nAnyhow they offer many \"tiers\" of service from a basic $11 mani, to a cheapie $20 no-frills pedi to the $55 Delux spa pedi.\n\nI went for the $36 spa pedi - a regular pedi with 10 minutes of extra massage (Ti-Kim - my technician - set a TIMER.).  So far, so good.  However, the polish selection are all no-name brands - with a few scattered bottles of OPI.  My suggestion - bring your own polish (and possibly your own base and top coat.)\n\nThe real test will be when I get a mani here.\nOh - and they do gels for $25.  \n\nIt's OK - but I have been spoiled by high quality/low cost NYC nail care (and more recently 4 sisters in Center City - the newer location).\n\nTi-Kim is  a lovely lady - so see if she is there if you go.\n\nI will be back - this place is leaps and bounds ABOVE the other spots I've seen in Media/Aston.",

    "text": "Alma - you disappointed me very much tonight - but redeemed yourself a bit in the end.\n\nI had long been planning a cocktail party at Alma for (originally) 10-12 colleagues and friends.  I called the restaurant, as I have had 3 parties here before - and although I am aware they do NOT take reservations for Happy Hour/Bar, I wanted them to at least know we were coming at 4:30 so they would not be taken by surprise.\n\nWell, we were taken by surprise when we arrived and the front door was locked - It' was about 4:10 PM.  So I thought - \"maybe they don't open until 4:30??\" and we went to a cafe and came back at 4:30 - and one of my friends was waiting at the door (since 4:15).  So I called them and they said \"We open the bar at 4.\" and I replied, \"Well, we're standing in front of the door\".  So they apologized and came and opened the door.\n\nAnd things went downhill from there (and then came back up).\n\nWe were seated and then told that happy hour ($6 Mojitos and Sangria) does not start until 5.  So basically if we ordered any drinks they'd be full price ($9).  Also there are no more 1/2 price apps - so we were stuck paying $12 - $15 for the apps. (Which greatly affected my plans - since I was to be paying for the food and my friends paid for their own drinks).  Oh - and any apps we ordered would not come out until after 5 because the kitchen is not ready until 5.\n\nFinally 5 PM came and we began to drink and eat - and folks came and went (about 16 in our party in all - and we spent HUNDREDS of dollars.).\n\nThe handling of the bill was a huge cluster fiasco - I was able to pay for my drinks and the first rounds of apps on one bill - but Janel, our server, put all the other drinks on another (large) bill and then folks who left had to battle it out with cards and cash to figure out who owed what.\n\nSo then we had about 8 people remaining and things calmed down.\nThe manager brought us a small sampler of finger foods (tempura battered baby corn, fried chickpeas and something else) gratis.\n\nA friend and I were still hungry so we split a (delicious) entree of duck breast.  The kitchen split and plated it for us at no charge which was great.\n\nBy now, poor Janel - who I really think hated us at the beginning of the night was getting much friendlier.  She brought us a Chocolate cigar (also complimmentary) and we ordered a few dark & stormies and were on our way.\n\nWe had fun - but the beginning of the night was very, very rough and we seriously thought about going elsewhere - but stayed since it would have confused the (12-15) other people in our group.\n\nIt's a shame really, in 2011 and 2010 I threw similar parties (with 1/2 price apps and split checks) with no issues and great service.\n\nTo ask your guests to wait 30 minutes (after waiting 15 at the locked front door) and not honor the Happy hour is poor form.\n\nNext year?  There is NO WAY I will have my party here.\nToo rich for my blood.",

I am writing this review months later.  Or MAYBE I am just a jaded ex-NYC chick who can't tell good food when she tastes it anymore?\n\nBut, I was distinctly underwhelmed by the dark decor, lackluster service and overhyped food at Tinto.  Yes, there is true Galician cuisine to be had here - which is a rare and refreshing change.  The selection of cheeses and pork products (alas, i don't eat piggie meat) are awe inspiring - as are the tremendous prices for the small, small plates.  I do commend Jose for finding true authentic regional Spanish specialties like Membrillo and other accompanyments.  For that you should really get the 4th star.\n\nFor lunch - by myself I had the $16.00 grilled lamb chops (whic, indeed, were grilled to perfection - but HECK - I coulda made that at home.)  I also had the White asparagus gazpacho - which was a true disappointment.  It was far too rich - almost like eating a bowl of cream.  The pluche was the best part - microgreens - the only gree to be found in my $30.00 lunch (with NO BEVERAGE.)\n\nSorry Jose - but for the master that you are - I should not have to pay $30.00 for a single lunch *(no dessert, no drink) to sit at an elevated (and un-comfortable for short people), hard wooden stool, at cramped tiny tables.\n\nService was OK - but so NOT friendly.  I cam in a 12 noon on the dot and had the place nearly all to myself.\n\nI have not since returned.  I grill a damn fine lambchop myself.\n\nI wanted to love it here - and in theory I do - but in reality - I just CAN'T.\nP.S.  If you are Kosher-ish or don't eat Pork or Shellfish - you may want to pass.",

This time, also, the pound cake was not stale.  Thank G-d!\n\nService was just OK.  The owner/server (maybe she's not the owner but she was acting owner-ish) kindof ignored us and seemed annoyed when my little one dropped a piece of penne on the floor (though I can't say I blame her -but you could at least FAKE that you were happy to see an actual customer on a DEAD Monday at 5 PM.)\n\nMy little one and I listened to the friendly bartender count bottles of flavored vodkas in preparation for restaurant week.  \n\nFinally more customers came - a couple in their 40/50's were MAKING OUT at the bar at 6 PM.

Today's server, Meghan was just as nice.\n\nMy colleagues & I each ordered 1 soft drink and 1 entree each.  Some have \"make your own\" pasta - for $9.99 (Salad additional).  I had a delicious lunch portion of the chicken with artichokes & mushrooms in a (fattening) lemon sauce (Full of butter or oil - but tasty none-the-less).\nI have also tried the \"Antonio's Rigatoni\"  (Rigatoni with braised beef - tender and delicious - in a tomatoe sauce with caramelized onions.) which is really good.  I have it with cremini mushrooms added.\n\nMy colleague's chicken parm looked good - but not spectacular - which is just how Romano's is.\n\nGood but not spectacular.\n\nOh - and the Olive Oil they serve for dipping on each table is pure bitterness in a bottle.  It's cheap garbage. Please consider upgrading your olive oil.  It is literally inedible.  The bread (which comes out hot as a small square loaf) - is pretty good.\n\nDesserts were very inexpensive ($1.99 - $3.99) but we were too full to partke (BIG portions even at lunchtime).",

It harkened to a traditional French preparation - with a lemony twist.\n\nI also really liked the house-made gnocchi, but the oxtail on top of it was very oily (even moreso - and yes, i know - oxtail is not a \"light and healthy choice\".)  That said, they offer an app & entree portion and I should have gotten the smaller app portion.  I took about 1/3 of it home.  It was very tasty.  (Just a wee bit oilier than I'd like.)\n\nMy friend had the (again house-made) agnolloti - which were good, but not spectacular.  After eating the asparagus salad - the sauce for the agnollotti (which also has butter and lemon in it) seemed a but redundant.  Maybe that was our fault for a bad ordering choice??  In any case, the fresh fava beans were EXCELLENT.  (I'm a fan of teeny-beanies!)  \n\nThe 2 (male) bartenders who also served us were prompt and couteous.  Alas, my chef-friend, had already left for the night - but he is doing a great job in turning this place around.\n\nA vast improvement on the menu front.\n\nDinner for 2 ran us just over $50 - but we did not order drinks or dessert.

I stayed in a different (cheaper) hotel overnight while attending a conference here.\n\nThe facilities themselves are 4 star and the hotel provides a variety of room sizes and configurations for meetings.  However, the plated meals were absolutely bland and awful.  Chicken was dry and bathed in a (jarred) marinara sauce and an overly sweet balsamic reduction.  Brown and wild rice was overly salted - to the point of inedibility.  The best thing?  Steamed asparagus.  Cheesecake for dessert was frozen for sure.\n\nGives a whole new meaning to the \"rubber chicken\" dinner.\n\nIn the mean time, the meetings themselves were fine - and water/cold drinks were provided for during breaks.\n\nNo major issues, but based on the food I sure as heck would NOT have my wedding here. Or any other event where guests want GOOD tasting food.",

Wow.\n\nThe salad was just OK - not the best Caesar and not bad by any means - a bit over-dressed and heavily sprinkled with parm (which some may enjoy.)\n\nI am in no hurry to rush back here, but if I did I would bring more money and go for dinner and get the \"full experience\".\n\nThe $10 cheapie lunch is just \"Meh\". (Serves me right!)\n\nOh - my server, Erin was a doll - giver her a raise.  She could use it!",

I literally had to get up and find somebody. Twice.\nNo bueno!\n\nAlso our original table had not one but at least 3 tiny flies buzzing about. So we asked to moved tables, the flies followed.  Not pleasant.\n\nThe good itself was hit or miss. Simple dry-fried string beans were tasty. Cabbage in a pumpkin soupy sauce was not.  Shrimp fried rice was very basic, not orgasmic, but good.  The pork belly bun appetizer is worth a try.  Buns are fresh and the pork belly was delectable.   Contains peanuts so beware, my allergic diners!\n\nI would come back, but I am in no rush to do so, which is a shame because the decor is lovely and everything on the menu sounds better than it is.",

Some for the better - but most are not.\n\nBefore I dive in - let me just say - or scream - this:\n\nNOT GOOD FOR KIDS!!!!\n\nOur fussy party of 4 included my not-so-fussy 8 year old - who has dined at many Philadelphia spots.  Before we went I saw \"Crispy Chicken Nuggets\" on the \"Bites\" menu - so I knew that was what we would get for her.\n\nBOMB!  Dark meat chicken chunks in very pale (nearly white) tempura batter made the young lady frown almost instantly.\n\nSo we asked if the \"Spaghetti al chitarra\" (Homemade spaghetti with butter, scallions and crab) could be made as just spaghetti with butter?  What a fuss ensued - and after negotiations, yes - they brought her a small plate of home-made spaghetti DROWNED in butter.  And tried to charge $18 for it (which is the normal price when it comes with crabmeat.).\n\nSo disappointed.\n\nOK - so \"kids meal fiasco\" aside - how were the grown-up dishes?\nNot bad.  Salads were the stand out - my kale salad was terrific (Matyson's is better - as Fork's is a bit too vinegary in my opinion), and my friends split the \"Roots\" - a unique preparation of seasonal root veggies.\n\nAppetizer pastas were SMALL and $15 - $16 each.  Yikes.\n\nOur server is a great guy - and I just knew I had seen him before!\nBut the whole \"not sure if we can make pasta with butter\" thing just sat with me very poorly.\n\nEven Ellen herself (the owner) cam out to chat with us - and I pretty much told her all of this.  I don't think it will matter one bit in the long run.\n4 star food and 2 star (maybe even 1 star) service.\n\nI won't be back. And there is no way I will deign to bring a kid in here.

It was OK as \"french\"-style onion soup goes but I have had better (and I have had worse.).\n\nThe place is MASSIVE - a great idea for private parties -especially on a night when you can enjoy the deck.\n\nThe best part of the night?  Meeting fellow yelpers Jessica E. and Chris from Delaware!  Thanks for coming out!",

I especially remember the sign \"The customer is always WRONG\".\n\nMeanwhile the tatted-up, nose-ringed gal behind the counter was sweet as could be to my little one - who was the reason we got a $2.75 Ginormous piece of \"Lorenzo's Oil\" (Remember that movie?

I ordered a pomegranate martini and ask for it NOT to contain Sierra Mist.  (I mean, really, Sierra Mist?)  The $8.50 martini was basically vodka, Monin Pomegranate Syrup and seltzer.  It was fine and I was able to cultivate a buzz in about 12 minutes.\n\nMy friend wisely chose the shrimp fajitas which were served on a sizzling platter and tasted pretty good.  I poorly chose a great steak which was so gristly I had to send it back.  Poor, Stewart took it back and the next one they brought was at least edible.\n\nBut flavorless.\n\nI literally had to put salt and pepper on it and was eyeing the A-1 (I HATE A-1!).\nA good steak should have flavor on its own.  Maybe that's why they put \"Cabernet butter\" aka Country Crock on all the grilled items?\n\nAnyhow - dessert was a BOMB. Over sweet cheesecake on a cardboard and wood-shaving crust.  Do not even think about getting the syrup-ed-out creme brulee here.\nAt least it was cheap ($2.99 for the dessert \"bites\")\n\nBelieve it or not - I am giving them 3 stars (they really deserve 2) because they were very accomodating to all of our requests and we had a fun time.\n\nWould I come here again?\nNot unless I had another gift card - and even then - I think I would re-gift!",

    "text": "I really want to give them higher marks as this GORGEOUS (large) facility has enormous potential, a top-ranked chef and a fabulous sounding menu.  Service was good, but dish execution had too many things wrong to be ignored.\n\nMy Kir Royale was made with flat prosecco - I clearly got the last of an opened bottle, but that is even forgivable if the meal was good.\n\nMy husband's dish was excellent - if a bit over-sauced (tender, home-made Cavatelli in s rosa/blush sauce).  I would discover first hand how heavy they pour the olive oil. I ordered the burrata of the day (m.p. was $17 - OUCH - but OK.) but that was NOT what was brought to me.\n\nInstead i got a \"doctored up\" caprese - and I am a HUGE fan of caprese so I agreed to accept the (beautiful) plate and began to eat it.  Drowned in Olive oil, and the Plum tomato (served quarted) tasted fermented.  It was not visibly rotten - but it really, truly was.\n\nI am happy to say they took the salad ($14) off the bill.\nPlease ease up on the sauce and oil!\n\nNext time - and yes, there WILL be a next time - but not right away - I am getting a pasta (folks one table over had the pan-grilled chicken parm and another table ordered rigatoni with one enormous meatball) - they looked amazing.\n\nThis is really a 4 star place - and has potential to be a 5 star place - but we are off to a rocky start with 'Teca.\n\nOh - and the $8 Tira Misu in a mason jar is light as air and delectable.\n\nPrices are far too high for this neck of the woods - but they have ALOT of overhead to pay for including party rooms and glorious pizza oven-bar that seats 16 and a HUGE cocktail bar, wine cellar and much more.  And they are STILL building.  WOW.\n\nI am hoping they will make improvements and hit their stride soon.  We had a far better meal at the \"original\" West Chester \"Teca in 2013.\n\nSee you in 5-7 months!

(If they have your size.)\n\nOf course, by the time it's on sale my size (fat cow 10) will probably be gone.\n\nI fel very fat when I shop here as usually they only go up to size 10 or 12 and they are usually gone.   If you are a size 4 or smaller (lucky, lucky, you) you'll have better luck.\n\nAre you a big girl?  Don't come here!",

DH's chicken cheese penne was overly salted and the noodles were over cooked (so NOT al dente).\n\nThe inlaws split a vat of Spinach dip and MIL had a rather sweet 1/2 rack of baby back ribs.  FIL did not like the Quesedilla burger, because the tiny burger pattie was lost in the vast recesses of the large floppy torilla.  \n\nOh well.\n\nAt least the kid didn't scream.

DD was upset - she wanted real fruit.  She's 6 - she knows what good is.  She told me later that she liked \"last year's place\" (Delicatessen - they no longer do dinner) better.  We always have jewish-style food and blintzes on Shavuot.

    "text": "Chain pseudo-Brooklyn-Italian (Immigrant cuisine circa 1954) in whopping huge portions.  (Only recently has Buca Mio - for one - become an option.)\n\nThey make a passable Chicken Marsala and decent pizza.  It is, indeed, carby goodness!\n\nI have my ordering down to a science - especially when dining alone.\nI get a side of fettucine alfredo with the alfredo sauce on the side (so I can control the amount of glop).  A side order is HUGE.  Then I order ONE SINGLE (yummy) meatball - which is the size of a small baby's head.  (*ouch, the imagery*).\n\nI then slice up the meatball and put the red sauce (\"It's Gravy if you're from soufilly\") and a bit of the alfreddo over the pasta.\n\nA tasty heart attack on a plate.\n\nThe decor is loud and so are the clients.  This is the only restaurant I've been to where the table in the kitchen (it's a hoot) is QUITER than the tables in the dining rooms.\n\nCheck out the \"pope room\" and the ladies room while your there.  What a hoot!\n\nGourmet - mais, non - but fun?  Why, yes!",

All had salad (caesar or classic), bread and baked rigatoni.  Kids got to \"make their own\" pizza\" in shifts at the chef's table in the kitchen.\n\nBucca is not the greatest food - but for a 7 year old's luncheon party it's a neat choice.  The kids had a ball.  The adults took excedrin.\n\nSasa and Kyle and our other serves were amazingly patient. Thank you!",

The rude (and disorganized) reservation system and lines at check in and check out really take away from the over-priced just OK massages and pedicures that I have gotten.\n\nI can't speak to the salon (hair/make-up) services - but for spa treatments - there are better places to go.\n\nThat said I got a gift certificate for $100 here and I gave it away to the receptionist in my building who was absolutely thrilled and delighted with her first-time ever massage.\n\nBut for a jaded, ex-NYC day spa owner, toppers needs to re-tool it's customer service and therapies in order to continue its legacy.\n\nTry Terme di Aroma, Spa Elysium in Chestnut Hill - or even the pricey Phoenix, instead.",

    "text": "Finally had a chance to dine in at the (not so) new location in Media and my issue is NOT about price - the prices seem pretty fair, actually.\n\nI ordered Pico & Chips (I have had their delicious pico several times before - as a take out item - they add chunks of avocado to their pico making it super yummy). and for $5 they should have called it CHIPS and pico.  there was a 4 oz paper cup of pico - so I ordered another ($2.00 more) so my friend and I could share.\n\nAlso it took a long time to sit and wait for it - i think somebody goofed as I sat and sat and sat (and took a few phone calls) and eventually had to ask at the counter where it was.\n\nFinally my friend & I ordered salads (we both opted for small \"side\" salads - fairly priced at $6.) She had the Caesar and I had the beet salad.  They should have called this KALE salad as it was basically a plate of balsamic vinegar-dressed kale with a glob of beets on top (best part) and 3 balls of goat cheese.  There was no mention of kale nor goat cheese on the menu - and I am not a big goat cheese fan. Not ordering that again!\n\nSo for $13 I ate 1/3 of a side salad and some chips & pico.\n\nHardly the greatest dinner ever.\n\nAlso - I wanted to get a single (fish?) taco as advertised on the website but now you must order 2 or 3 tacos - no more single taco orders.  I hope they will reconsider this and bring it back.\n\nThey need to update the website menu.\nAlso there are inconsistencies on their printed menu at the restaurant (Cheese plate pricing on page 1 does not agree was cheese plate pricing on cheese list (page 3).\n\nI will be back and we love the owner - they are a terrific member of our small Media community, but I honestly, have had better meals.\nNext time I will order a real \"plate\" and see what transpires.\n\nOh - and the eggplant parm (I thought about ordering that - when I saw it on the website menu) is no longer on the paper menu.\n\nMany small things \"wrong\" added up to a lower rating than I had hoped to give.  The place is very nice, and I hope my next experience will be better.",

P. is your place.\n\nI came here with a group of 27 people and we were easily accomodated in a private room (with our own bar and buffet area) and service by Michele was excellent.\n\nThe drinks during happy hour are cheap enough - 1 beer and 1 well-tequila margarita ran me $7.\n\nThe food is fine.  Chicken or Eggplant parm, penne marinara, veggies and over-cooked roast beef with rolls and horseradish.  Not great but not awful either.  Very \"safe\" and everyone enjoyed the dessert tray with brownies, pound cake (looked like Sara Lee) and mini canolli.\n\nWe had a great meeting and would definitely have events here again.\n\nThere is even an old-fashioned ballroom (seats up to 150, I think) huge with it's own dance floor and restrooms - suitable for a down-scale wedding or a bir rehearsal dinner or graduation party.\n\nThis place is HUGE and has many configurations for groups large, small and massive.",

I enjoyed my veal-leg slices and could cook just ONE at a time which was great.  The also ship right to your door with plenty of dry ice.  The website is easy to use and your friend (whoever refers you) gets 5% credit from your purchase.\n\nThe bad - in order to get the prices to drop from ridiculously expensive to insanely high, you either have to join as a Rastelli Consultant (minimum monthly order requirement) or join the \"Smart Shopper\" program - which drops the price 20%.  Still too damned high.  And they try to lock you in to a monthly auto-ship feature.\n\nOh and the $19.00 (about $16 after the discount) Steamazing frozen entrees (2 for 16 is ridiculous still) were glorified lean cuisines.\n\nNo thanks, Rastelli.  The quality just does not justify the price.  (They have to build in comissions for your upline.)\n\nI will order again - but not every month.  No way.\nMy steaks are gonna continue to come from Omaha.",

So last Friday me, my husband and our active 4 year old daughter dropped in for a quick dinner.\n\nDD's gyoza were the best part of the meal - freshly cooked and perfect. (Even if frozen.)  DH had a greasy, heavy chicken lo mein, and a spicy tuna roll that he enjoyed. I tried a specialty roll - at $11.95 I expected better.  It was stuffed with Shrimp Tempura and Cucumber and coated with spicy tuna (not the best I've had but OK).    What killed it was they literally DUMPED a load of Tempura Flakes all over it.\n\nNow don't get me wrong - I like tempura \"crunch\" but this was over kill.\n\nI also ordered a green salad.  I should have known better and ordered the ultra-sweet orangey-ginger dressing (again - I've had better) on the side.  The iceberg lettuce and sigle slice of tomato were fresh and crisp.  Not gourmet - but good.\n\nIt's a solid 3 star joint.",

The \"Wilmington (aka Fattening) Roll\" was deep fried salmon and mayo and onion.  Not for me!\n\nThe $10 order of 4 \"lobster\" shumai came in a rich, delicious cream sauce - but the dumplings themselves contained very little lobster (nearly all filler) and were not worth the money.\n\nWe did not have dessert.\n\nI liked it here - and it has a sexy \"bar-type\" vibe.

(Ours was fair.)\nWe arrived at 1:15 on a Wednesday - 2 of us - for a late lunch.\n\nOur cheerful (and obviously new) server seated us and brought water right away.  After a while we each ordered chopped slads but with different items omitted and added.  After a VERY very long wait (for salads!) they salads arrived but neither mine nor my companions had tomatoes (and we wanted them and they were supposed to have them).\n\nSo very quickly the salads were brought back with the tomatoes and were fresh and crispy and very good.\n\nThen the bill came - my friends salad (which last at $8.50) was $8.50 but mine was $12.00.  Wow.  I sure wished I had known that omitting bacon and adding chicken would cost me $3.50.  Again - not the end of the world but considering I omitted one protein in exchange for another, I kinda hoped they cut me a vbreak or tack on 2-$2.50 max.  Even LaCroix Rittenhouse only charges $4.00 for a chicken breast.\n\nOK - enough raggin'.  The salad was good - crisp romaine and delicious dressing.\n\nI will return - but I'm not in any great hurry.  (We picked it for location near my friends school.)\n\nOh - and they serve Capogiro Gelato (nice) - but we didn;'t get any.  They also have some outdoor seating, and an espresso bar.",

Because the food it just not that great.\n\nHere's why...\n\nFirst of all this place is VERY kid friendly - so if you want a quiet spot, this is not for you.  We were seated near the front door (which blasted us with frigid air each time someone opened it) and next to us was a table of 15 middle schoolers.\n\nOh my.\n\nSo that aside, our lovely young server (Blake?  She told me her name twice and I still did not retain it.) was attentive, friendly and 5 star all the way.\n\nBy now the noise is nearing deafening.\nWe get our apps/snacks.  French Fries (an enormous order for $4) and $12.50 for the tuna tartare which was drowning in 3 types of sauces.  All sauce .  Could barely taste the fish.  It's a shame because in concept this could be a wonderful dish.\n\nNext came a cup of beef chili with sour cream which was good but the beans were a little hard/tough.  Not too spicy (which for me was a good thing) but if you are a chili lover you may find it too mild.\n\nDessert was the best part and even it was not that great.  A home-made \"Chipwich\" - 2 chocolate chip cookies with chocolate (or vanilla) ice cream in between.  Enormous - and we took part of it home.\n\nAll that said, I will return to Christophers - but with Teresa's and Matador and Paramour all nearby - there are better dining experiences within a quick walk.\n\nChristopher's is a great place to take your over-indulged, entitled children (Mine included - but even \"the princess\" would balk at the over sauced tuna tartare).",

And in all those years the food has never improved - yet people still go here and many, many people LOVE it.\n\nJust not me.\n\nI don't HATE it - it's just \"Meh\"xican.  Boring, nacho-esque Ameri-mex.  (Or worse, Pennsy-Mex?)  But I do love Doug Esch - and all the D. Esch boyz.  Lot's of nostalgia for me at Poco's.\n\nSave me a barstool, pour me a margarita, rocks 'n salt - and I'll be downing nachos along with the rest of 'em.",

So go early or very late, or else there will be a wait for a table.\n\nOut party of 7 was seated right away at 8:35 AM on a late summer Sunday.\n\nThe kids breakfasts are huge and caloric - the chocolate chip covered Pancake Bear or the Sprinkle & whipped-topping laden \"Rainbow panckaes\" are a big hit with our little girl - but man are they BAD for her.\n\nService is a bit spotty and often there are no creamers, or no jam or something is missing that we need.  If we ask they will get it for us.  Weird.  \n\nThe breakfast rush is quite a scene for sure here at Perkins.\n\nOh- and there are sometimes COUPONS in the Daily Intelligencer - so be on the lookout for those.",

    "text": "Nicely presented food - but the quantity was pretty skimpy - but that may be because of the reduced bugdet our building had for parties this year.\n\nAnyhow, Miles catered our building's annual holiday cocktail (really beer, wine & soda) party and set out some antipasto (delicious olives, caponata, artichokes with long, tasty stems) cheeses, dried fruits and fresh grapes, a few dessert items. (Frozen creeam puffs and pre-made tartlet sheels filled with gloppy cream. A few cannoli.)  Uninspired. (But it beats chips 'n dip.)\n\nAs said before -presentation was lovely.  Service was great.\n\nThe also butlered a few platters of seared tuna with a wasabi \"cream cheese\" on a crispy-fried chip.  They were delish!  The cranberry chicken spring rolls were odd tasting.  The beef brisket sliders looked vile.  I passed.  Friends enjoyed the mini crabcakes and toasted \"grilled cheese\" one biters (with goaty-goat cheese.  Baaaaah!).\n\nAll in all, the servers were friendly and efficient, but the food was just OK - and there was not enough of it.  \n\nBut hey - it was \"free\" (we pay enough in rent throughout the year to justify a holiday bash!).",

She just seemed a bit pissed off for most of the time we were there. Note:  they will NOT split the check on weekends,\n\nThe food was very salty and heavy (especially what we ordered) but presented nicely.\nMost of all though - it was over priced.  $15.50 for a pulled pork sandwich?  $17.50 for my 10 year old's fish & chips?  Ugh.  Oh - and sodas are $3.25 each NO refills.  OUCH!\n\nBut there are cute doggies there (a very dog friendly place) and it's great fun to sit outside.\nWe do not live near here, and unless we are going canoeing again and North brook or coming here with locals we likely won't be back any time soon.",
