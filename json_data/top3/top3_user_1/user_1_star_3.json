Ah, the '80's - and we all owe a debt to Rocky Ayoki.\n\nThe sushi selections have improved a bit - although fish selections are limited and the Hamachi Hand Roll I had was sub-par.  (Tamago was froze - for $2.75 a piece).  Prices were too high for that sort of mediocrity.\n\nService was harried - we were seated on a rainy Sunday at 7 PM in the bar area, albeit with our picky 7 year old who did not care for her $3.90 Strawberry Lemonade.  (She had water instead.)\n\nEdamame was boiled within an inch of its life.\n\nMy MIL had a tasty steak teriyaki - surprisingly yhe best of the lot.\nOh and for $4.00 a single round blob of chocolate Hagen Daaz was unceremoniously plopped in a dished and thrown at my child.\n\nNot in a hurry to return.",

Oy vey.  Strange \"crunchy\" fishy topping that we did not like.  Lots of fruit -mango and strawberries.\n\nThat said, we will be back - but try more affordable, conventional maki next time.\nThere is no way I would get sashimi here again.\n\nHigh prices (2 roll lunch combo is $12, 3 roll is $15.

OUCH!).\n\nKeshia, our server was very nice, but clearly overwhelmed as she had the entire upstairs all to herself to manage.  Our lunch took far to long, and my friend was stressing out b/c she had to go back to work.\n\nMeanwhile, the salad with petite jeweled vegetables was great (the veggies taste like candy!) and the veggie (pasta-free, cheese-free) lasagne was good too - but it had a bit of a \"harissa-like\" spice that crept up on me after a few bites.  The side of tabouleh was lightly lemony and sublime.\n\nGreat food, excellent drinks but too high of a price point and too slow for lunch-rush service.\n\n\nTry the Persephone - a souped-up mojito with 10 cane rum, pomegranate and a bit of jalapeno.

So refreshing.  They also make a REAL \"Dark & Stormy\" that packs a robust gingery punch.  Soooooo good.\n\nMeanwhile, 4 of us lovely ladies had drinks & dinner here last night.  Service was good by the servers, but the bus \"girl\" was too aggressive in removing plates before we were finished.  She got the hint the 2nd or 3rd time we guarded our plates.  \"No, we're not finished quite yet\".\n\nAfter a round of refreshing drinks (best part of the evening for me, anyway), we started with a $3 bar snack of duck liver, spread thinly on 2 crisp toast points.  It was a little gamey.  Would not re-order.\n\nThe best appetizer by far was the gnocchi.  Now I realize the reviews here on that gnocchi are mixed, but we told them light on the oil and it was great.  Served with REAL morel mushroom.  2 of us split one order and another lady had an order all to herself.\n\nHoney & Whiskey glazed petite chicken wings were very tasty, but also small and boney.  (Large portion, small wing size.)\n\n2 of us, myself included, had the tilapia po boy.  My friend loves this sandwich, i  thought it was just OK.  I wanted to try the lobster BLT special, but the night we went (a Sunday there were NO SPECIALS at all.)\n\nQuel Dommage.\n\nAfter our meals, we had a dessert course.  A nice cheese plate came with red grapes, walnuts and 3 generous cheese selections including Morbier and Stilton.\n\nThe rest of the gals shared a chocolate/peanut butter mousse, which was chilled, dense and not at all goopy.  It was served in a perfect circle with a dulce du leche beneath it.  Not too peanutty, but full of milky chocolate flavor.\n\nThe booths are made of a hard wood and look great but are small for a party of 4 and not comfortable.  This can actually help the restaurant to turn tables - as you won't sit too long (ha, ha!).  The bar was packed at 8:30 PM on a Sunday.  Nice to see in this crappy economy.\n\nI will return to P&K but it is not a holy grail. Oh, and it's not cheap.  (but not horrible) $40 each for the 4 of us.\n\nOh, and we love the \"pabbit\" logo - pig/rabbit.  Reminds us of the divided we fail logo where the Democratic Donkey and Republican Elephant are merged.  CUTE.\n\nNice job!  Please don't let it slide.",

It was also served sans cornichons - a sacrilege - but 3 small french pickles were brought right away (thankfully for no charge) upon request.\n\nThe seafood cocktails - shrimp, crab (2 legs for $18 - ouch) and lobster all were effortless to eat.  ($16 for 4 shrimp - eeek!)  My friend and I were still hungry so she got the French onion soup (and I helped!) which quickly killed our appetites.  (Heavy - but sweet and not to salty and delicious.)\n\nProfiteroles for dessert were very good but not orgasmic.  (And I had been eye-ing them all evening.)\n\nSo would I return?  Hell, yes!

Also the rice had been siting around a little long - great flavor - but tasted like the remnants of lunch.\n\nAgain, this is probably \"my bad\" and I bet at lunch when the turnover is higher, the food is likely fresher and tastier - but meanwhile - I can;t wait to go back (at 11:30 pre-lunch line crowd) and give them another try.\n\nThe 2 dudes ahead of me orderes $2.00 side of falafel (3 balls per side) and that seems just about perfect.  \n\nAlso I did not try the hummus which looked awesome - and for just $.50 you can add a bunch of mix-ins and toppings, if you care to.\n\nOwners are 3 culinary partners and the one I met tonight was a sweetie.  I intend to try them again and re-yelp - hoefully with more stars.\n\nKeep it FRESH - from first client to last - and you'll have more dinner business.\n\nAlso - I noticed they open at 9 AM - I wonder if they'll offer breakfast?  Shakshouka to go?\n\nPrice is \"Philadelphia Lunch\" approriate - $8 - $10 (more if you dare to get a beverage.)",

They did not give us water until we asked.  Many of us had no cutlery nor napkins.  Again, we asked.\n\nSasha - one of our servers, was lovely - but stretched too thin to accommodate all of us, who ordered (partially separate checks) bar items, bar menu items and dinner menu items.  Items and courses sometimes came right away and other orders were lost in the shuffle and never arrived.\n\nMeanwhile, my partner (on the same check) and I shared the $3 Parisienne Gnocchi (Paris is not known for Gnocchi, by the way), the $5 Mac & Cheese (both from the BAR menu) and a $7 side of sauteed brussels sprouts.  All were delicious - but the gnocchi was SWIMMING in butter and I would not order it again.  The brussels sprouts were the high point for me.\n\nOthers at the table had the Quinoa/Ratatouille dinner entree - and the Quinoa was way, way undercooked.  It was crunchy.  Fortunately the ratatouille was excellent.\n\nDecor is sleek & gorgeous (I mean, the place is brand new.) and the food is NOT \"Mariott-era\" hotel fare.\n\nI am pleasantly surprised and plan to return - but I will allow ample time and expect erratic and weird service.",

I walked in at 6 PM on a Tuesday and the place was DEAD - in fact I thought it was closed from the parking lot - but went inside anyway.\n\nNo hostess, no wait staff, EMPTY diningroom - except for an elderly couple slowly eating in a front booth.

Then she disappeared for a long while and then came back and took my order.\n\nThe food - and I love Persian/Iranian food - was just Ok - yes the rice was 5 star stellar - but I paid $30 for a plate of rice and overcooked chicken (in a delicious sauce, though) thighs (Fesenjoon).  The chicken was so dried out and hard.\n\nYick.\n\nMeanwhile the rice (and the crispy/burnt rice on top) was great.\nI also enjoyed the Shirazi (cucmber/tomato/onion salad) but it was drowning in lemon juice and way too oniony.\n\nI wanted to LOVE it here - and many people do, but the slow service, high prices, awful chicken and DATED ancient decor downgrade it for me. And $30 for basically rice and onion salad (no drinks, no dessert).  Other diners got baklava (not sure if they ordered it) but I never got any.\n\nNeeds a service and decor makeover.

Meh.  Fine.  There was ONE cherry tomato and ONE cucmber slice buried at the bottom. Whatever.\n\nNext I got a specialty sushi roll (I can;t remember which one - I think it was the Lotus Inn Roll) that was just OK.  The sushi fish here is just OK.  Not bad and not great.  I also got an order of sake (salmon) sashimi ($6.50 for 3 thin slices) which I never should have gotten.  Meh.\n\nFor $14.95 I expect more than an alaskan roll with a few slivers of Escolar on top.  Escolar is NOT white tuna.  Albacore is white tuna. Thank goodness I remembered to get the sauce on the side.  Fish was good - but not superb. \n\n\nBut whatdya expect?\nMeanwhile the party of 6 next to were raving about their chicken & brocolli and shrimp chow mein.\n\nMaybe I oughta stick to cooked foods here.\nOr the Salmon Lovers Lunch ($14.95) which I have gotten a few times.\n\nAtmoshpere is relaxing.",

We had a semi-open bar for 45 minutes - and beer on tap and house red or white wine.  I had the Pinot Grigio which I did not enjoy.  However, the barkeep (a lovely young lady) and hostess were attentive and very, very hospitable keeping everyone's glasses full.\n\nI shoulda had a pint of Harp or Bass.  Oh well.  Next time.\n\nThen we were ushered into a private dining area.  A choice of soup or Salad (this was - in my opinion) the best part of the meal.  The house salad was EXCELLENT - 4 stars easily - perfectly dressed fresh greens, lots of cukes & carrots and 2 perfect cherry tomatoes.  Accomanied by a basket of fresh warm bread.  I succumbed to the Irish Soda Bread with creamy butter.  Sooooo good!  A friend had the potato parmesan soup which looked awesome (and fattening as hell) and she just LOOOVED it.\n\nBut the entree failed me.  We had 4 choices - a burger (looked great), grilled salmon (looked OK - not earth shattering), a big greasy plate of delicious fish and chips (I tasted a friend's fish - which was begging for malt vinegar - a bottle quickly appeared.) - and my entree - the roast chicken.\n\nOr should I say the dessicated chicken?  \n\nThis chicken was so dry and over cooked it was just not enjoyable.\n\nUGH.  OK - Star off for that.\n\nDessert redeemed TNN - with a luscious banana split - with warm caramelized banana halves.\n\nWe had a lovely time and I will return (and maybe even give 'em 4 stars next time) but no WAY would I order the roast chicken EVER again.\n\nOh - you should also know that prior to our dinner - a colleague and I sat on the outdoor patio (we had arrive early) and were given water in FILTHY dirty glasses.

It's a shame because I love a good french onion. This one was like eating a salt-lick.\n\nThe cute blonde female bartender was very sweet and gave us terrific customer service (and did not charge us for the salty soup).\n\nCan't wait to come back for a full meal. This place is hoppin' at most time of the week and is packed on Summer waednesdays for \"Dining under the stars\".  (AKA \"Chaos out in the heat\")\n\nI like this place much better than Sligo so far.\nA fun bar scene for middle-agers like me (ha ha!).",

IHOP is the kind of chain that can vary greatly in cleanliness - but the food is EXACTLY the same in each and every location, as it is cooked via formula by disinterested underpaid teens and young adults.\n\nSurprisingly enough we have never come here during the mad breakfast rush - but rather on Sundays after 4 PM when it is dead empty - and thus our service is usually good and food hot.\n\nMy hubby likes the flavored pancakes - and I really enjoy the crepes.\nNot a Holy Grail by any means - but it is cheap and good in a pinch.",

I called the restaurant, as I have had 3 parties here before - and although I am aware they do NOT take reservations for Happy Hour/Bar, I wanted them to at least know we were coming at 4:30 so they would not be taken by surprise.\n\nWell, we were taken by surprise when we arrived and the front door was locked - It' was about 4:10 PM.  So I thought - \"maybe they don't open until 4:30??\" and we went to a cafe and came back at 4:30 - and one of my friends was waiting at the door (since 4:15).  So I called them and they said \"We open the bar at 4.\" and I replied, \"Well, we're standing in front of the door\".  So they apologized and came and opened the door.\n\nAnd things went downhill from there (and then came back up).\n\nWe were seated and then told that happy hour ($6 Mojitos and Sangria) does not start until 5.  So basically if we ordered any drinks they'd be full price ($9).  Also there are no more 1/2 price apps - so we were stuck paying $12 - $15 for the apps. (Which greatly affected my plans - since I was to be paying for the food and my friends paid for their own drinks).  Oh - and any apps we ordered would not come out until after 5 because the kitchen is not ready until 5.\n\nFinally 5 PM came and we began to drink and eat - and folks came and went (about 16 in our party in all - and we spent HUNDREDS of dollars.).\n\nThe handling of the bill was a huge cluster fiasco - I was able to pay for my drinks and the first rounds of apps on one bill - but Janel, our server, put all the other drinks on another (large) bill and then folks who left had to battle it out with cards and cash to figure out who owed what.\n\nSo then we had about 8 people remaining and things calmed down.\nThe manager brought us a small sampler of finger foods (tempura battered baby corn, fried chickpeas and something else) gratis.\n\nA friend and I were still hungry so we split a (delicious) entree of duck breast.  The kitchen split and plated it for us at no charge which was great.\n\nBy now, poor Janel - who I really think hated us at the beginning of the night was getting much friendlier.  She brought us a Chocolate cigar (also complimmentary) and we ordered a few dark & stormies and were on our way.\n\nWe had fun - but the beginning of the night was very, very rough and we seriously thought about going elsewhere - but stayed since it would have confused the (12-15) other people in our group.\n\nIt's a shame really, in 2011 and 2010 I threw similar parties (with 1/2 price apps and split checks) with no issues and great service.\n\nTo ask your guests to wait 30 minutes (after waiting 15 at the locked front door) and not honor the Happy hour is poor form.\n\nNext year?  There is NO WAY I will have my party here.\nToo rich for my blood.",

I am basing this review on a large event my group had in there upstairs, private space.  \n\nWe had about 90 people, an open beer, wine and well drinks bar (excellent) and appetizers (not so much).\n\nFirstly, there was not enough food (in quantity) and the quality of the small platters of apps (place on the bar - not butlered) was pretty meh.  Pretzel nuggets with mustard dipping sauce (cheap!), Mediocre quesedillas, and a strange bruscetta with an unidentifyable brown meat-or-possibly-eggplant on top.  Still have no idea what the heck that was all about!\n\nAnyhow, service was fine - bartenders were quick with our moderately-drinking crowd of adults in there' late 20's to early 50's.\n\nWill I rush back here?

The food?  Sub-par at best.  The best bite of the night was the steamed broccoli (which was loaded with butter, I think.)

Service was good, but dish execution had too many things wrong to be ignored.\n\nMy Kir Royale was made with flat prosecco - I clearly got the last of an opened bottle, but that is even forgivable if the meal was good.\n\nMy husband's dish was excellent - if a bit over-sauced (tender, home-made Cavatelli in s rosa/blush sauce).  I would discover first hand how heavy they pour the olive oil. I ordered the burrata of the day (m.p. was $17 - OUCH - but OK.) but that was NOT what was brought to me.\n\nInstead i got a \"doctored up\" caprese - and I am a HUGE fan of caprese so I agreed to accept the (beautiful) plate and began to eat it.  Drowned in Olive oil, and the Plum tomato (served quarted) tasted fermented.  It was not visibly rotten - but it really, truly was.\n\nI am happy to say they took the salad ($14) off the bill.\nPlease ease up on the sauce and oil!\n\nNext time - and yes, there WILL be a next time - but not right away - I am getting a pasta (folks one table over had the pan-grilled chicken parm and another table ordered rigatoni with one enormous meatball) - they looked amazing.\n\nThis is really a 4 star place - and has potential to be a 5 star place - but we are off to a rocky start with 'Teca.\n\nOh - and the $8 Tira Misu in a mason jar is light as air and delectable.\n\nPrices are far too high for this neck of the woods - but they have ALOT of overhead to pay for including party rooms and glorious pizza oven-bar that seats 16 and a HUGE cocktail bar, wine cellar and much more.  And they are STILL building.  WOW.\n\nI am hoping they will make improvements and hit their stride soon.  We had a far better meal at the \"original\" West Chester \"Teca in 2013.\n\nSee you in 5-7 months!

I still loathe chain restaurants - and even moreso loathe crowds, but tonight wasn't too terrible from a culinary perpective.\n\nThe frantic (almost) 5 year old had a $4.99 hot dog (what a rip) with a cup of applesauce and an OJ.  The inlaws had a 2 for 20, as did my husband and I.  I played it safe with a burger - which was edible and not bad.  DH's chicken cheese penne was overly salted and the noodles were over cooked (so NOT al dente).\n\nThe inlaws split a vat of Spinach dip and MIL had a rather sweet 1/2 rack of baby back ribs.  FIL did not like the Quesedilla burger, because the tiny burger pattie was lost in the vast recesses of the large floppy torilla.  \n\nOh well.\n\nAt least the kid didn't scream.  Plus the 5 of us escaped from Applebee's for around $50.  Not bad.\n\nI won't rush back but I expect to be summoned here yet again next summer.  I think once a year is far too often.",

She had the Caesar and I had the beet salad.  They should have called this KALE salad as it was basically a plate of balsamic vinegar-dressed kale with a glob of beets on top (best part) and 3 balls of goat cheese.  There was no mention of kale nor goat cheese on the menu - and I am not a big goat cheese fan. Not ordering that again!\n\nSo for $13 I ate 1/3 of a side salad and some chips & pico.\n\nHardly the greatest dinner ever.\n\nAlso - I wanted to get a single (fish?) taco as advertised on the website but now you must order 2 or 3 tacos - no more single taco orders.  I hope they will reconsider this and bring it back.\n\nThey need to update the website menu.\nAlso there are inconsistencies on their printed menu at the restaurant (Cheese plate pricing on page 1 does not agree was cheese plate pricing on cheese list (page 3).\n\nI will be back and we love the owner - they are a terrific member of our small Media community, but I honestly, have had better meals.\nNext time I will order a real \"plate\" and see what transpires.\n\nOh - and the eggplant parm (I thought about ordering that - when I saw it on the website menu) is no longer on the paper menu.\n\nMany small things \"wrong\" added up to a lower rating than I had hoped to give.

It was not crowded and service was good.  \n\nThe second time I came I had a platter of sushi and it was not as fresh as it should be.\n\nThe last time I went - and I will not return, the service was just awful.  The $17.95 maki I ordered, while HUGE and containing ingredients I like, was dripping in 3 kinds of gloppy sauces.  Go easy on the sauce, guys.  Use fresher fish and pare down to basics.  Some things don't need tempura crunch AND eel sauce AND spicy mayo AND whatever that other glop was.",

There are much better places IMHO to get Italian-American food.\nThey do make a decent pizza (but Rustica in Northern Liberties is much better) and serve large plated entrees of decent - not memorable - chicken, fish & veal.\n\nThe pasta was, indeed, al dente - which was a plus.\n\nService was fine - but it was crowded and very loud.  I don't like to sit outside - the whiff of auto exhaust from Walnut Street is not my idea of a fine dining al fresco experience, so we were trapped inside with the hoardes.\n\nDon't go on a Friday night, is all I can advise.\nMaybe don't go - try Le Castagne instead.

Dogs are so welcome - and there are many cute dogs to pet while you vist.\nOn the minus side?  ONE tiny ladies room and always a line.",

($6).\nThe food is way, way over priced especially for the meh quality.  My Flank Steak salad had a small portion of delicious sliced steak over a bed of boring mixed greens with 3 (no kidding, 3) tiny cubes of diced tomato.  I asked for more tomatoes and they were brought.  No cucumbers were  available.  For $16 that is kinda steep.\n\nDH also had flank steak - his was also a small portion (too small in his opinion) served with grilled zucchini, red and yellow peppers.  $22.  (Whoa.)\n\nOur kid had the pulled pork sandwich ($14) sans coleslaw.  It was very smoky and kinda dry.  She added BBQ sauce to it.  Brioche bun was tasty.  \n\nThe fries that came with the sandwich could be a memoir all their own.  They literally glistened with grease and were so oil-soaked it was almost comical.  They were presented in a cute \"mini fry-basket\" lined with paper that el kiddo said \"was (clearly) not doing it's job\".\nNo way for $6 I would have ordered a separate side of these oil-slick fries.\n\nUnless I am dragged here by fellow Media-ites, I am in absolutely no hurry to return to SPB.\n\nStick to the beer and you'll be fine.",

The \"Wilmington (aka Fattening) Roll\" was deep fried salmon and mayo and onion.  Not for me!\n\nThe $10 order of 4 \"lobster\" shumai came in a rich, delicious cream sauce - but the dumplings themselves contained very little lobster (nearly all filler) and were not worth the money.\n\nWe did not have dessert.\n\nI liked it here - and it has a sexy \"bar-type\" vibe.

Because the food it just not that great.\n\nHere's why...\n\nFirst of all this place is VERY kid friendly - so if you want a quiet spot, this is not for you.  We were seated near the front door (which blasted us with frigid air each time someone opened it) and next to us was a table of 15 middle schoolers.\n\nOh my.\n\nSo that aside, our lovely young server (Blake?  She told me her name twice and I still did not retain it.) was attentive, friendly and 5 star all the way.\n\nBy now the noise is nearing deafening.\nWe get our apps/snacks.  French Fries (an enormous order for $4) and $12.50 for the tuna tartare which was drowning in 3 types of sauces.  All sauce .  Could barely taste the fish.  It's a shame because in concept this could be a wonderful dish.\n\nNext came a cup of beef chili with sour cream which was good but the beans were a little hard/tough.  Not too spicy (which for me was a good thing) but if you are a chili lover you may find it too mild.\n\nDessert was the best part and even it was not that great.  A home-made \"Chipwich\" - 2 chocolate chip cookies with chocolate (or vanilla) ice cream in between.  Enormous - and we took part of it home.\n\nAll that said, I will return to Christophers - but with Teresa's and Matador and Paramour all nearby - there are better dining experiences within a quick walk.\n\nChristopher's is a great place to take your over-indulged, entitled children (Mine included - but even \"the princess\" would balk at the over sauced tuna tartare).",

So go early or very late, or else there will be a wait for a table.\n\nOut party of 7 was seated right away at 8:35 AM on a late summer Sunday.\n\nThe kids breakfasts are huge and caloric - the chocolate chip covered Pancake Bear or the Sprinkle & whipped-topping laden \"Rainbow panckaes\" are a big hit with our little girl - but man are they BAD for her.\n\nService is a bit spotty and often there are no creamers, or no jam or something is missing that we need.  If we ask they will get it for us.  Weird.  \n\nThe breakfast rush is quite a scene for sure here at Perkins.\n\nOh- and there are sometimes COUPONS in the Daily Intelligencer - so be on the lookout for those.",

(Frozen creeam puffs and pre-made tartlet sheels filled with gloppy cream. A few cannoli.)  Uninspired. (But it beats chips 'n dip.)\n\nAs said before -presentation was lovely.  Service was great.\n\nThe also butlered a few platters of seared tuna with a wasabi \"cream cheese\" on a crispy-fried chip.  They were delish!  The cranberry chicken spring rolls were odd tasting.  The beef brisket sliders looked vile.  I passed.  Friends enjoyed the mini crabcakes and toasted \"grilled cheese\" one biters (with goaty-goat cheese.  Baaaaah!).\n\nAll in all, the servers were friendly and efficient, but the food was just OK - and there was not enough of it.  \n\nBut hey - it was \"free\" (we pay enough in rent throughout the year to justify a holiday bash!).",

Ugh.  Oh - and sodas are $3.25 each NO refills.  OUCH!\n\nBut there are cute doggies there (a very dog friendly place) and it's great fun to sit outside.\nWe do not live near here, and unless we are going canoeing again and North brook or coming here with locals we likely won't be back any time soon.",
