DiBruno Brother's couldn;t help us.  Neither could Dunkin Donuts, nor Cappriccio (though the manager tried).\n\nThe coffee favors available on \"wedding\" websites as favors is sub-par pre-bagged swill.\n\nWe wanted QUALITY - and with La Colombe - our guests got it - for reasonable coin, too.\n\nWe ordered a case (96 pouches) of the house blend and bagged each pouch in a cute little tulle bag, and added a Yankee Candle \"buttercream\" votive.  Between the coffe and the cream - our closet smelled heavenly.\n\nThe coffee favors were a huge hit and La Colombe is the ONLY Philly coffee place to come through for us.",

    "text": "OK, Brace yourself.  It's gonna be a long review.\n\n3 of us went to R2L for an amazing dining experience last night.\nAnd even though there were some problems (big ones) with service, the exquisite food more than made up for it.\n\nDanny & Zaga - you \"make your mamas proud\".\nThat semi-open kitchen was running very nicely.  Your garnish chef, poultry man and line crew were in a good groove.\n\nDaniel Stern's newest creation is in a gorgeous, dimly lit (and on a hoppin' Saturday night - very loud but still, surprisingly, comfortable) space.  The light fixtures, sculpture, bathrooms, stainless steel salt & pepper shakers (unused and unneeded) even the jacket of the wine list - all set off the gorgeous floor to ceiling views of the city.\n\nOur lovely female bartender mixed us excellent drinks (brandy soaked cherries that are simply divine - I could eat a handful easily) and explained the menu while we waiting for our friend to arrive.\n\nAfter we were seated our new and VERY nervous waiter (I think he had been there 3-4 days) explained even more.  We forgave him for using his notecards.\n\nWhat was not so forgivable was the service snafu.\n\n2 of the 3 of us ordered apps which were brought in short order after a delicious house-made bread.  The apps - which I truly recommend (those here with low food reviews - man, I think you may have ordered the wrong things) were the steak tartare (served in a rough chopped with plenty of shallots.  I ordered mine \"not too spicy\" and it was delicious.  Accompanied by crispy toasts with sort sort of butter (I think she said \"beet butter\" but it must have been golden beets as the color was a pale yellow).\n\nMy friend was not yet even finished his appetizer - crabcakes (which I did not try but he liked them and they looked great.) and his entree and side were brought out.\n\nThen we sat.\n\nAnd sat.\n\nAnd finally said - \"go ahead and eat it while it's still hot\".  So he started to eat his (signature dish) Veal 5-6 ways.  So fabulous.  YOU MUST TRY DAN STERNS famous veal plate.  Accompanied by crisp butter-tossed broccoli florets.\n\nSo while he ate and my husband and I sat there and stared around - I said \"This is a screw up\". \n\nAnd, indeed it was.\n\nFirst our (now petrified) young server came to apologize.  Next the manager came and said that our entrees were \"3 minutes away\" and apologized and said that they would do something \"special\" to make it up to us.\n\nWhen our entrees did arrive - they were so worth the wait.  The filet accomanied by prociutto (I always spell that wrong) wrapped leeks (divine) just melted in your mouth - and the shortribs (want a little beef with your beef?) were good, too.\n\nI opted to get an app as an entree - and had the unqiue -and uber-rich - lobster mac 'n cheese.  It was more like mezza-canelloni each topped/stuffed with small, buttery lobster medalions.  Served with it was a copious amount of rich, creamy cheese sauce - cheddar, gouda and something else.\n\nWOW.  Don't miss the lobster mac!\n\nTo make up for the weird dinner service (AWKWARD!) they comped our desserts, cappucinos (delish - La Colombe)  and 2 of the 4 glasses of wine.\n\nThe pineapple cucumber sorbet was simply perfect.  Refreshing and \"sang\" on the palate.  Served over diced honeydew and plums.  The blackberry verjus sorbet was also good - but nothing compared to that Pineapple Cucumber.  It was capogiro worthy and obviously house made - served in perfect quenelles. (Can't wait to try the Kalamansi icecream and of course - who doesn't love a good gianduja?) Oh, my thighs!\n\nMy friend ordered the chocolate cream and apple pie (with a decadent sour cream quenelle beside it.\n\nAlso to make things \"special they gave us an amuse-bouche pre-dessert of cinnamon panna cotta with a lovely rose-water sugar crysal topping and two picture-perfect fresh raspberries.\n\nAfter dinner they served us each a crisp (not rock-hard) house-made cinnamon biscotti and - the best yet - buttery blueberry financiers (OK I can't spell that either).\n\nKUDOS to your pastry chef.  He or she is a keeper.\n\nOh and Zaga is really a master - wow.\n\nSuch fun to watch y'all work.  If you can fix a few kinks in your service and have a more welcoming hostess stand - the 5 stars will stick!\n\nGood work!  We can't wait to try your place in University City.\n\nOh - and they have a small private party room that seats 12 or so - and I hear a big one that seats about 100.  This would be a great wedding or rehearsal dinner setting.\n\nAnd I bet plenty of marriage proposals will go down here.\n\nSwanky, urban, romantic, high quality American classics with a BIG twist.",

And there's a sign on the back kitchen door that says, \"Beware Attack Waitress\" and they are not kidding - those ladies can work it!  Yes - there are 3 terrific Laotian cooks, grilling up greek fish.  And it somehow all just works.\n\nPerfectly.\n\nA close friend and I (tip - do not come with an odd number of people - a single gets stuck at the counter, and a 3 will be forced to do a deuce with an extra chair) ate dinner here.  We split everything and ordered just right.\n\nMozzarella & Tomato salad was delicious, fresh, easy to eat and cut up home-style.  Perfectly seasoned.  Baba (no Ghanoush - ha, ha!) was some of the BEST I've ever had, bursting with charred eggplant flavor, olive-y richness and fresh garlic zing.  Not too oily.  Just AWE inspiring. (Great with that char-grilled pita.)\n\nNext came a perfect Scampi (or Gambas if you were in Spain) with an abundance of fruity olive oil, garlic  and paprika.  Delish.  (Dip some of that pita in the oil when nobody is looking!)  And they are not skimpy with the shrimpies.  We had at least a dozen.\n\nAnd a platter of grilled veggies - mostly Zucchini and Green Bell Peppers, but also a few red onions, pepperocini & olives.

I had 2 of 'em.\n\nI can easily seeing just giving this place 4 stars - it is NOT fine dining and there were a few service related flaws, but for pure, simple Greek/Med cuisine (and perhaps the East Coast's BEST BABA) I give them 5.\n\nAnd I can't wait to go back.\n\nAnd I kinda want to try the other location on 22nd Street, too.",

It's crowded enough as it is - if I tell you I'll never get a table.\n\nOK, I'll tell you a little bit.\nIt's a no-decor, little atmosphere place run by a genuinely NICE family (the hostess/daughter is marrying the pizza chef in August 2008 in Brooklyn).  They make their own mozzarella, and bake fresh brick-oven pizza on a thin - but not-too-thin crust.\n\nThe shrimp scampi is ENORMOUS - they give you over a dozen shrimp.\nIt is garlicky & oily - so if you order it light on the garlic 'n oil it's even better (IMHO).\n\nThe Veal Parm is a flam-family (that's FLAMILY) staple and my mom & I can easily split it.  (Comes with a side of pasta.)\n\nFresh (onion-y) bruschetta arrives on the table nearly as soon as you are seated.\n\nCappucino is light and frothy.

Love you, Rachel G! (Love Anna, too.)\n\nI had a long, luxurious 90 minute aroma-therapy massage (Swedish with a bit more pressure just where my back needed it) and hand-selected citrus and lavender essential oils. There are over 40 oils you can pick from and they'll blend you up a customized synergy for your treatment.  Nice touch.\n\nBLISS.\n\nThe waiting area was spacious - and even though there were 6 (yes, six) people waiting for 10 AM appointments on a Sunday, it was quiet and calm.\n\nI was NOT offered a robe or to change, so I guess they just have massage clients change in the treatment room - which I am OK with - but it may not sit well with everyone.  One lady was wearing a robe (she was having a facial, I guess) but the rest of the 5 of us \"lowly\" massage clients just sat in our regular clothes.\n\nThey also sell Yeah-Baby slippers - which are super comfy.\n\nThe spa uses Yon-Ka skin care products and carries a nicely stocked array of aromatherpy products, candles and gift items.  I succumbed to a Persimmon scented jar candle - which at $6.50 (small/votive size) wasn't too bad.\n\nThere was NO pressure to buy - which was GREAT.\n\nThe owner (Jeff?) seemed cordial and the boutique person/receptionist (Stacy? Stephanie?) was very welcoming.\n\nI will come back for a SERIES (Saves you $10 - $30 depending on the series you pick) of treatments next time.\n\nIf you are a tourist visiting Old City or a local who lives near here - Terme di Aroma is worth checking out.  And - they validate parking for select garages/lots.",

The service on a non-busy lunch shift is quite different than the after-work bar scene or dinner or brunch.\n\nD\u00e9cor is just lovely and service was fine - the busser was new and clueless, but the female server was terrific.\n\nBut for lunch?  Albeit a pricey one ($70 for lunch for 2 - not including drinks or desserts, including tip).  We got 2 entrees (The crab/seafood louis - which is DIVINE) and 2 apps.  The devilled eggs (We got all peppadew - normally you get one of each in a sampler, peppadew, bacon and truffle) and a crab-stuffed piquillo pepper app (2 pieces) which was ABSOLUTELY marvelous.  Not too spicy.  Akin to a crabcake with luscious sauces on the plate.\n\nI.  LOVED. LUNCH.  here.\n\nI'll be back as soon as my wallet can recover.\n\n(I am thinking Bar for Happy hour.)",

Sounds like not enough?  WRONG!!!  Many of the choices are heavy. (Even at tapas size.)\n\nStandouts amoung the 14 different items we tried?\n\nGambas (your basic garlic shrimp - done just right), Flatbread with Artichokes (divine), Yellow tomato gazpacho (perfect on a summer night) was garnished with crab salad and avocado ice cream (Yes - a savory icecream pluche).\n\nThe crab-stuffed peppers were so incredibly creamy, crabby and tasty we ordered one more plateful.  (So I guess we had 15 dishes among 7 ladies).\n\nThe plate of veggies (can't remember the name) was simple and perfect - tomato, pepper, onion and a delectable eggplant dip.  It was accompanied by crispy-thin bread smeared lightly with a chive goat cheese.  HEAVENLY.\n\nLamb meatballs were too rare (nearly raw)  for most of the groups liking, but the sherry cream sauce and fresh green peas were tasty.\n\nThe salad with figs and blue cheese came literally wrapped in Jamon.  Weird and not my bag - but it, too, disappeared.\n\nMeanwhile, they ARE heavy handed with the salt and the (salty) cheeses - so if you KNOW this (you, smart -yelper-who-pre-reads before you go, you!)  Ask for items light on the (salt) (Cheese) (Sauce) etc.\n\nI can't wait to come back here - at an off time - with more than 2 other people.\n\n2 dishes apiece for 7 people came to $280 (including tax 'n tip) including ONE sangria each.  (Well, not I, I had 2 virgin mojitos with a splash of pineapple juice).  \n\nJose, baby,  you live up to your hype.\n\nAnd I have now been to all 5 Philly Garces joints.  Huzzah!\n\nOh - and if you don't eat pork or shellfish - you'll have a TOUGH time here.  And if you are vegan - fuggedaboutit!  (Dairy is hidden in things)",

The server called me by name (Ms. F.) numerous times during the meal.  Attentive without being over-breaing and just perfect.\n\nMy dining companion started with the onion soup - which looked marvelous, and I had a delectable tuna tartare.  The swimmingly-fresh fish was cubed and tossed with a wonderful blend of herbs and red peppers (bell peppers), It was artfully plated with tiny cubes of fried diced potatoes.\n\nFor entrees my friend had a deliicous - if a bit salty for my taste - dish of baked ham & cheese risotto - so comforting on a winter day.  I had an Or-Gas-Mic and perfectly medium rare, sliced DUCK BREAST (Don't miss this) served with halved ripened blackberries and house-made gnocchi that were heaven on a plate.\n\nDesserts were petit amuse-bouche style including profiteroles, chai creme brulee (miniature) and a sublim Opera torte (complete with the classic gold leaf garnish.)\n\nI was having flashbacks to my honeymoon cruise in Europe.\n\nWhat a TERRIFIC place.  Much like Arnold Scwartzenager - I'll be baaaack!\n\nI gotta try that brunch.",

DH enjoyed perfectly cooked shortribs accompanied by ricotta filled pierogie (yum!), our friends had a simple chicken and I again indulged in a lovely duck sous-vide.  \n\nOh - and the desserts were marvelous.

    "text": "Wow!!!!!  I am gonna go out on a limb here and give these fine people the full 5 stars (some may argue its a 4 star experience - but what we had last night was truly 5 stars all the way.)\n\nNOTE:  We also went BACK on 4/4/09 and it was fabulous AGAIN!\n\nStarting with the bar and terrific bartender who mixed me a fine Whiska-retto Sour (That's a Canadian Club Whisky Sour with a splash of Amaretto to sweeten it up. - YUM.).  The bar has a retro feel with colored shelves that slant at different angles to display the bottles of liquor.\n\nNext we (there were 4 of us) were seated by our gracious host/waiter/manager (possibly owner?) and ordered lots of tasty treats.\n\nWe started with an appetizer course.  I had a terrific goat cheese (mild - not too goaty) and beet salad.  2 of us has the slightly salty but very tasty French Onion Soup, and we all tasted the Chicken Shumai (obviously frozen - but tasty nonetheless.).\n\nAlso the stuffed portabello mushroom is SO TERRIFIC.\n\nSince one of the entrees - Pasta \"Mikey\" appealed to all of us - we ordered one order and split it 4 ways on 4 little plates as a pasta course.  The pasta was penne, coated in a rich, creamy pink sauce accented with shavings of proscuitto.  Very tasty and perfect as an app.  (May be too rich to eat a big plateful.)\n\nFor entrees the standout was the lamb - a gorgeous frenched rack of 8 chops total, served with airy riced potatoes and asparagus spears.  The meatlof entree (with more of the delicious mash) and my husband's \"special\" of flaky-crusted chicken pot pie, all disappeared.\n\nWe were nearly stuffed by now, but stayed for delicious rich cups of freshly brewed coffe and decaf.  And split amongst us 1 cheesecake (classic and creamy) and a decadent chocolate bourbon pecan pie.  (The crust of which was outstanding.).\n\nWe have returned twuce.  What lovely evenings we have had,  surrounded by gorgeous decorations and the classic portraits that adorn the walls.\n\nThis is a unique place that seems like \"nothing\" when you walk by.  Go INSIDE!!!  Go!!!\n\nYou will not be disappointed.",

Her spa pedicure is worth every penny and is like heaven on earth for me.\n\nWell - I am one of Cheryl lee's faithful following.  Cheryl is just about the BEST nail tech you'll ever know.  I came to spa elysium on a very hectic, very icy, overbooked day before Xmas.\n\nThe expansive salon (spa is downstairs - nails & hair upstairs) was buzzing with activity and the front desk greeters were just not paying attention.  There was NOWHERE to sit in the waiting room (it was that packed) and many stylists were running late so people were getting grumpy.\n\nMeanwhile, sunny Cheryl was running right on time.  (I arrived by train about an HOUR early.)  I started with a luxurious spa pedicure - which I can not recommend enough.  I also indulged and got a spa manicure ($25 vs. the regular $18 mani.)  Next time I will get a regular mani.  The extra exfoliating scrub was nice - but not needed each and every time.\n\nI just love the way Cheryl does her nail services.  Very clean, thorugh and attentive to details.  My feet were smooth and cuticles neatly cleaned up. The polish was applied precisely and immaculately.\n\nCheryl - you are 5 stars in my book - but please tell the spa management teamt o shore up their front desk operations.

Also some folks chose unsweetened iced tea.\n\nAppetizers were monumentally delicious, especially the escargot, 1/2 order or sweetbread ravioli and burrata served with thinly sliced golden beets.\n\nOne lady ordered the special app - a HUGE charcuterrie plate with 6 different Italian cured meats including prosciutto and GUANCIALE.  Heavenly! (Plus garnishes including crostini and lovely artichokes.)\n\nOur meal continued with entrees (A bit pricey at 25 - 35 a pop and the special - a huge steak for 2 was $70!!!) that were generously portioned.  Hamachi was gorgeous as was the stuffed veal breast.  I had the duck breast (served med-rare with the perfect amount of Quack!) and polenta.  So terrific.\n\nDeeserts were the only place Paradiso fell short.  While the ricotta cheese cake was silken and lovely, the bombolili were heavy as lead.

    "text": "Another outstanding review for nail technician extraordianaire, Cheryl Lee.  I visited the spa today for a standard pedicure (I usually get the spa pedi) and \"regular\" manicure.  Both were top notch.\n\nCheryl is only there on weekends now, but I wish she were there more.So book an appointment in advance.  She is worth it and in demand!  I hope the management there knows what a gem she is.  her pedis last for weeks - and her polishes are precisely applied.  She uses a pre-basecoat drying treatment (when indicated) that helps the base coat (Seche Clear) to bond to the nail plate.\n\nShe also uses Seche Vite top coat which is an HG (Holy Grail) product in the nail tech world.\n\nCan' say enough good things about the nail services at spa elysium - done by Cheryl Lee.\n\nP.S.  The spa itself is a 4 star operation.  They have a NEW front desk person (at least she seemed new to me) named Amy who was cheerful and a big improvement.\n\nIf I lived in Chestnut Hill this would be my go-to spa.  It blows Spa 3000 BC away!!!",

She made a \"Tropical Sundae\" fruit arrangement for a co-worker and it was delivered as specified PERFECTLY.\n\nShe even added 3 extra choclate dipped strawberries.\n\nThese fruit creations really do taste as good as they look - just be sure to order seasonally - pineapples and strawberries can vary in ripeness throughout the year.  Spring and Summer arrangements taste better in my opinion.\n\nFruit Flowers is a great alternative to simply sending flowers.  Great for condolences, thank you gifts and of course birthdays and anniversaries.\n\nWe also had one delivered to the restaurant where we had our wedding rehearsal dinner (that was handled by the BucksCounty/Southhampton store).\n\nI love this concept and the execution!",

DIVINE.\n\nOur only complaint?  The $15 nachos (close to $20 if you want chicken) used to be an enormous platter - not anymore.   The nachos are still wonderful but you get much less - plenty for 3 people - but not for 9.\n\nThe 5 stars goes for the tremendous service including separate checks and rushing in a happy hour order (Iron Hill's Happy Hour drink specials end at 6 PM!!!!) for us.\n\nSo glad I planned my Ladies Night Happy Hour here.",

BLTC&E (Bacon, Lettuce, Tomato, Cheddar and a fried egg - on Rye with a light smear of lemon aioli. - WOW!) Everything I have ever ordered here has been terrific and the hostess (older lady) is delightful. Love this place!!!!\n\nMy colleague ordered Mac & Cheese with Bacon & Tomato - and it, too, was delicious but a full plate of that would send me straight to nappy-land! \n\nI wish they'd offer a side of the plain Mac or a 1/2 order. PLEASE CONSIDER THIS!!!!!\n\n Oh - and the Turkey Cobb is amazing too (sounds like whatever - but the turkey is fresh roasted and the composition is ON POINT.)\n#FoodOnFleek",

I hade my birthday party here in March (11 women with mucho mojitos, caipirinhas and many apps.)\n\nTonight however was a simple evening - executied perfectly.  A close coleague and I shared the divine thinly-sliced scallop ceviche - bright with tangy acidity.\n\nWe also shared (gotta have 'em) the tuna tartare tacos and royal palm dates.  A heavy but delicious bowl of duck confit fried rice - brimming with umami goodness, topped with poached egg and studded with currants and edamame beans.  And of course, a sweet side of maduros with a drizzle of crema.  (Who needs dessert?  Heck, who needs entrees? We were stuffed.)\n\nInstead of dessert she had a Mighty Leaf tea and I got a delicioso cafe con leche.\n\nWhat a meal!  What a night!\n\nAnd fabulous service from the lovely lady who served us.   I wish i could remember her name, but I just can't.\n\nOh - and I had 2 virgin Clasicos and my friend had a black cherry caipirinha and a Clasico Mojito.\n\nStill on top of its game.\n\nLove you Doug-y baby!  Even though you beat my sorry a$$ on \"Ready Set Cook\" in 1996.  Poor me - I was paired with a wimpy pastry chef from California.",

I can judge the margarita when there is no fruit muddled in, no chi-chi twists, just pure Margarita goodness.\n\nMy dining companion and I both started with salads - the chopped salad - topped with crispy tortilla strips in a luscious buttermilk-chipotle dressing, and the GRENADA - you HAVE to try this in season - it is topped with a layer of jewel-like pomegranates and roasted pepitas.  Crunchy, crisp and fruity with a bite from the pequin.  YUM-I-NESS!!!\n\nThen we had the House-made chips, salsa and guacamole (10 - yikes!).  The chips and salsa were top notch and re-orderable - but with all the other great things to eat this is (*gasp* - can't believe I'm about to say this...)...\n\n...the first time that Guacamole was an afterthought for me at a Mexican restaurant.\n\nXochitl's guac was better - had a better flavor profile and was table-side prepared.  Not so at Distrito.\n\nAnyhow, we had a superb side order on Plantains & Crema (De-lump-scious).\n\nMy friend had the chicken tacos (not so great - sauce seemed to be an odd concontion of Hot Sauce, Sugar and Barbecue sauce.  Not a fave - but still edible.  I had the \"quesdailla\" - which looked more like fried pierogies, stuffed with w super-yummy pumpkin (calabaza) and cheese mix.  So decadent.\n\nWe were sooooo full by now - but could not resist the Churros - and were we glad we ordered them.  (Even better than Xochitl's)  9 mini churritos sprinkled with a vanilla bean sugar and served with a small (wish there was more...) scoop of home-made coffee ice cream  (WOW!!!!) and a tall shot glass full of warm Mexican chocolate and a top layer of dulche du leche.  ADDICTIVE!!!!    One could have easily downed the shot and licked the glass.\n\nOn weekends (we were in luck) there is a talented Mariachi singer.  He belted out Billy Joel's \"Piano Man\" in Spanish.  Service was attentive but I did feel rushed - especially when nearly everything came out at once - it was like \"SENSORY OVERLOAD\".  Our great looking male server helped!  It was also very, very loud in there.\n\nI would like to come back her on a Tuesday at 5 PM or another \"off time\" so I can hear myself think.\nI hovered between 4 & 5 stars and went with the five - because it really is a remarkable restaurant.  (Much better than Tinto.  I am jonsein' to finally try Amada.)\n\nThe bill for 2 including - only 1 alcoholic drink - tip & tax was exactly $80.00.",

Just skip that and get onion rings, cucumber salad, mac & cheese or rice.\n\nThe seafood itself is divine - Shrimp & Scallops broiled in butter were simple but tender and delectable.  Lobster salad ($42 a lb) is terrific and the shrimp salad is fresh and flavorful.\n\nDine in (simple digs - you don't come here for atmosphere) or take out, you just can't beat the super fresh seafood here - fried, broiled or grilled.

We were smart and made a reservation for the 3 of us - we took our 5 year old DD who just LOVES (and ate 6 of) the jumbo shrimp shumai.\n\nService was great considering how frantically busy they were (they had to turn people away) on a Friday night.\n\nMy husband's sushi was great - especially the crunchy spicy tuna roll.\nI had the (ENORMOUS) Zen bento box which came with delectable tempura and 4 pieces of sushi, plus kalbi, 1 shumai (we got a little shumai'ed out) and a spicy tuna roll.  (Yum!)\n\nIf you are a big eater consider the $36 Zen box - comes with miso soup (GREAT and homemade), salad (tasty soy-based dressing) and dessert.\n\nAs a surprise - and mostly why I am giving them 5 stars is that they brought our daughter a HUGE platter ($14 on the menu) called the Doma Dessert Sampler.  (FOR FREE.)\n\nThe dessert sampler came with:\n\nVanilla ice cream topped with green-tea cream cheese and a fresh blueberry\n\nMochi-covered Strawberries (home-made mochi) with a small pot of fudge to dip them in (WOW).\n\n3 fried banana-tempura drizlled in (more) chocolate sauce and caramel sauce.\n\nAnd a MOLTEN chocolate lava cake.\n\nIt was a HUGE platter of dessert - and easily fed all 3 of us (who, by the way, were already stuffed from dinner).  Somehow we managed to eat it.  (Ha!)  What a treat.  And how nice of them to do this for us.\n\nMy little one already adores DOMA and now I am quite sure it has surpassed Roy's and Swanky Bubbles (2 of my little one' faves) as her favorite restaurant.\n\nMan, I wish my parents had taken me to places like Doma when I was 5.\n(Yes, she was the ONLY kid in the joint - this is not a kiddie place.)\n\nKid's got good taste.

The pastry chef also sent out (gratis) 6 chocolate espresso truffles - hand made and yum-city!\n\nTeg the sommelier and GM is a doll and there were 2 weddings that night (it was a perfect 80 degree night).  One 36 party small wedding in the conference center and a huge (for JAI) 115 person wedding in the Wheelwright room.\n\nIt was fun to re-live our wedding day again (except that ours on 6/7/08 was in 96 degree heat!).  The service was great and we just can't recommend the JAI highyl enough.\n\nFor a wedding, a special dinner - or just to come and enjoy the food or lodging.\n\nTry the JAI - you won't be disappointed.",

She recently catered a \"heavy hors d'ouvres\" reception for about 50 people at my cousin's home.\n\nThe food was delicious and elegantly presented.  The lamb chops with pesto and duck 'n onion crepe were highlights.  Standards like shrimp shumai and asparagus tempura disappeared along with delectable mini-mugs of home-made creamy tomato soup served with grilled cheese triangles.\n\nHer staff of server and bar tenders were on point in both serving and clearing.\nThe blueberry-mint lemonade was refreshing and perfect for the event.  (The open bar was also great.)\n\nStationary displays of fruit were as beautiful to look at as they were tasty to eat.\n\nFor dessert?  Butlered mini desserts like freshly torched creme brulee and petit lemon tartes.\n\nI am considering hiring her for my own events and would urge yelpers to do the same!  She does Philly area, suburbs and South Jersey.\n\nLove Power Catering!",

    "text": "Can not...\n\n...write.\n\nToo...\n\n...weak\n\nLapsing into... food... coma...\n\n4.75 Stars.\nOMG - Have you ever had a meal that was such a calorie bomb that you literally felt all of the blood rush to your stomach to try and equalize what was happening in your system?\n\nI seriously feel weak from my anniversary dinner at Union Trust.\nDh & I had a very romantic, dimly-lit, 5-star service (Fabian, you ROCK!), unforgettable meal here tonight.\n\nI may need days to recover.\n\nWe started with cocktails/wine.  I had the Flyin' Hawaiian and with what little I normally drink (Being the Empress of the Arnold Palmer and all), after a few sips I was nicely buzzed and after one I was flyin'.  (2 might make me crash land.)\n\nOnce the buzz was on, out came our delectable apps.  A very good lobster bisque for DH and an icy-chilled crab cocktail perfection for me (better than Parc!).\n\nWe each had massive slabs of cow-on-a-plate.\nHe had the ancho-rubbed strip, garnished with salty (a bit too salty for me) finely-julienned frites.  I had a perfectly cooked cowboy ribeye (so huge I took over half of it home - and, I should mention DH took about 40% of his home.)  My major complaint (which nearly cost them a star) was the crust of the ribeye was WAY salty.  Not Arizona-desert salty, not inedibly salty - but noticably biting with salt.  Dommage!\n\nMeanwhile the spectacular (and for $9 - $11 a pop they outta be) sides saved the meal.  Mac 'n cheese was enough for 4 people (again, half came home - which our kid will appreciate).  The crispy top gave way to bubbling, hot, melty-cheesey-creamy-yet-tender (not at all flabby) elbows.  (I had been expecting shells based on other yelp reviews - but got elbows.)\n\nI love mac 'n cheese and the mac here is worthy!!!!  So good.\n\nA platter of donut-like sweet, tender Onion rings - battered to perfection and (the only thing?) NOT salty.  Wonderful.  I lterally ate 1/2 of one ring and was satisfied.\n\nDH also got a $3.00 dish of caramelized onions to go with his steak.  Not needed - but so tasty - with a light balsamic/demi sweetness to them.\n\nThe floor manager, our server (Fabian) and \"bus\" Valetin, were all on point with the service.  truly excellent.\n\nDessert (Come on now!  We have come this far - why not just succumb to the madness) was an I.V. of lipitor.\n\nNo, seriously - dessert DH had the s'mores (which did, in fact, look like a marshmallow-meringue hedgehog) atop a scoop of house-made peanut butter cup gelato.  The even wrote \"Happy Anniversary\" on the plate.  And put a little candle on it. Cute.\n\nI had a latte (delicous Saxby coffee - not Peregrine, but fairly good stuff) with a few spoonfuls of Frangelico in it.\n\nBasically everything - with the disappointing exception of the overly salted crust of the Cowboy rideye - was top-notch.\n\nWe hope to return again in about a year.\nIt'll take that long to recover my arterial walls.\n\nAlcohol, caffeine, salt, fat and sugar.\nA dietary disaster - but oh, so much fun.\n\nback...\n\n...to the sofa.\n\nI feel a pleasant numbness coming on in my left arm.",

Yes, it really is all that IF you order the right things.\n(I am torn between 4 and 5 stars, but I will be generous due to the fabulous entree and app I am about to describe.)\n\nFirst of all the Green Room is a great special occaision place.  The ornate, grand dining room, complete with a gilded music gallery (balcony up above) with a pianist on weekend nights.  The food and service are AAA 4Star for good reason.\n\nNot only are you paying for the decor and ambiance, the food and ingredients are terrific as well.\n\nThe Hudson Valley Foie Gras app was out of this world, and the $39 lamb chop entree - with 2 double cut, frenched rib chops (total of 4 ribs) kicked the baaaaaa out of the chops I've had at Joseph Ambler Inn, and Tinto (2 of the places I have recently had good lamb chops).\n\nThe desserts are $8-10 and the signature dessert - a White Chocolate Amaretto & Fresh Raspberry Napolean is a work of art and worth the price and calories.  Skip the deconstructed Pear tarte Tatin - but if you like get the fresh house made ice cream (the small orb of vanilla ice cream that accompanied the tarte surpassed it with each yummy, creamy, chilled bite).\n\nOh my widening butt!!!!!\n\nAnyhow - back to reality and my diet.  But don't miss a chance to have DINNER at the Green Room.  Especially if someone else foots the large bill.\n\nOh - valet parking is $14.00 unless you are a hotel guest.\nAnd also - someone re-train the hostess.

If you read Pat D.'s review - you'll hear all about the yummy treats she orded when we had lunch here today.\n\nI had the greek salad - and they were kind enough to \"hold\" the feta cheese for me.  The greens were crisp and 3 types of olives were used (2 green and 1 black variety) along with batons of red pepper and home-made dolmades.  The scrumptios  - and simple - lemon and olive oil vinaigrette made it SING.  Presented on a white rippled plate - very clever.  The plate allowed the dressing to pool away from the crisp greens and thus I could dress the salad as I wished.  YUM-MY!\n\nThe I had the Asian Dumpling soup.  The single dumpling had a shrimp-based filling and was scrumptious, as were the veggies in the soup.  The broth was a bit salty for my liking - but I am a no-salt added kinda gal.\n\nNext was the star of the show - and what I was WAITING for - Chicken & Waffles.  It was accompanied by tender-crisp southern greens (with a healthy shot of garlic) and thin-ly julienne deep-fried sweet potato strings.  Damn, what a great waffle!  The pulled chick on top was tender and delicious - but my one complaint was the copious amount of bland sauce.  It nade it a bit too \"a la king\" -ish for me.\n\nDessert for me was a simple - yet perfect fruit salad of watermelon (sweet and seedless) bites, blackberries,and a single slice of orange.\n\nService was good - I felt so bad for the guy in crutches who had broken his femur.  What a trooper.  \n\nI will be back - hopefully SOON. (And maybe even with Pat D!)",

We wound up having the cocktail hour indoors, to save guests from the heat.\n\nThe food, service and accomodations were all top notch.

Nearly everything in the multi-level salon is an antique and much of it is for sale.\n\nI come here, oddly enough, for nail services. (I have never had my hair done here - as frankly, i can't afford the prices, but a friend has her cuts and highlights done here.)\n\nI used to see Donna for FANTASTIC spa pedicures.  (They have a regular and a spa pedicure.  The only difference is $10 and an extra mask application.)  She was great - but she left, so now I see their long-term uber-manicurist, Ginny.  She is really loud and talks alot - so if you want a quient technician - she may not be the gal for you - but from a technical perspective she knows her craft.\n\nI am still on the quest for the perfect pedi - and Cheryl Lee (spa elysium) has that title in the bag so far.\n\nBut, I sure miss Donna.  She gave me a great pedi.\n\nOh - and they used to sell Kerastase here but now they carry another line. (Which is a shame because I would buy my Kerastase here.)",

    "text": "Happy freakin' brithday to me!!!!\n\nOk - I'm gonna do it.  I'm giving Davio's 5 stars.  I read all the yelp reviews before we went (and many were bad or just fair) - and I have to tell you - last night we had a true 5 star experience at Davio's.  Lemme break it down...  \n\nBefore last night's soiree I had pretty much ZERO desire to go here.  I walk by all the time and the menu seemed kinda small and boring and PRICEY as heck.  I wanted to go (and still want to go) to Butcher & Singer.  (And I will - one day.)\n\nOur party of 7 (Originally to be 9) sat at a lovely LARGE round table, and our server (Rodolpho?  Renaldo?) was terrific and gave great expalnations and recommendations.  The space (a former bank) has high ceilings and gorgeous wood floors.  Chairs are big and COMFY.  First class all the way.\n\nAfter a round of drinks (2 of my friends had drinks at the bar while waiting for the rest of us to arrive - but they were offered to sit at the table by the host had they so desired.) including Bellini Martini's (YUM) and Veuve Clicquot - simply perfection in a glass - we ordered or apps & entrees.\n\nThe round of apps included several standouts.  My friend LOVED the Philly Cheesesteak Spring rolls.  I had the beet salad - which I shared with a friend) and she shared her chicken livers - sauteed in balsamic with cherries.  Both were simply popping with flavor.  So great.\n\nWe also passed a big \"honkin'\" slab of Insalata Caprese around the table.  Now, I have had this salad (mozzarella & tomato) umpteen times in so many preparations - good, bad and indifferent.  This one was good - but not great.  The supposed \"Buffala\" mozz was fresh - but not as creamy as some.  The tomoto was a thickly cut beefsteak.  \n\nI definitely reccomend the chicken liver app and the beet salad with lemon zest, walnuts & fresh micro-watercress.  Both \"sang\" on the palate.\n\nMy DH had pasta for his app - and I had 2 delectable bites.  One of the fresh tagliatelle (WOWZA!) and a second mouthfull of the thick, meaty bolognese.  I would order this again for sure.\n\nEntrees were just as good as the apps with Osso Bucco, Shortribs, Ribeye Steak and RACK OF LAMB (Best in my opinion - and I ordered the osso bucco - BFF had the lamb) were standouts.  Fresh Branzino fillet was served atop a mound of risotto puttanesaca - rich with flavor.  My good vegetarian friend has angel hair arrabiatta - which he loved.  (But at $16 I would NEVER have ordered.)\n\nService between courses was perfectly timed.  Not too attentive, not too stand-offish.\n\nDesserts ROCKed.  Yes, it's trite - but 3 out of 4 of the ladies (myself included) ordered the molten chocolate cake (allow 10-15 minutes for prep - we were in NO hurry).  Served with Vanilla Gelato - it was plate-lickin' worthy.  A friend had tiramisu - looked more like a layered torte - another had a luscious sour cherry tart - which was more like a glamorous muffin top.  (I happened to enjoy the bite I snagged of it.)  Last but not least 2 of the gents tried the rich, yet light & fruity lemon pudding.\n\nWe were all treated to a chocolate covered strawberry on each plate (which I requested).  Many of us had coffees - and I had a lovely cappucino (yes, I know that nobody in Italy drinks capp past 11 AM - but hey - I wanted one - and it was damned good.)\n\nWhat a lovely evening.  Pricey as heck - and in my opinion this is a \"special occaision\" or \"expense account\" restaurant - but if some wants to take me here?  You bet I'm goin'!  And I fully intend to grab a girlfriend or two and order drinks & apps at the bar.  Those chicken livers are calling me...",

This is a hostesses nightmare and we were prepared to be told to \"sit at the bar\" but we got a table (in the bar area) right away.\n\nI had 2 of the tastiest Arnold Palmers you can imagine - made with the herb-infused house sun tea.\n\nEverything we ate from the fluffy warm brioche rolls with ramp butter to the delicate \"handkerchief\" pasta (mine with umami rich rabbit, my friends was vegetarian) to the luscious side of garden beets (at least 2 varieties of beet - possibly 3 it was hard to tell) and candied orange peel and a touch of creamy fresh ricotta. - All was wonderful - but the real showpiece was the special of SEASON ONLY squash blossoms (which I love!!!) delicately fried - stuffed with goat cheese and herbs.\n\nCalorie-city!  But so tasty - and we shared an order of 4 - so 2  seemed just about decadently perfect.\n\nWe also splurged and shared a Millefuille (more like quatrefuille - please tell me somebody gets my jokes...) of thinly sliced banana, toffee and chocolate served with a rich yet delicate quenelle (aka the Quenelle from hell) of dark chocolate sorbet. \n\nWow.\n\nBeets (pun intended) the heck outta Parc.\nSimilar price points but somehow we spent WAY less (no $60 seafood cocktail tonight, thank you very much).\n\nDinner for 2 with soft drinks and 1 dessert (no alcohol) was around $75 before tip.\n\nI can't wait to go back.\n\nGO TO TALULA'S. \nGo!\nGo!\nGo!\n\nAnd ask for Marina - what a sweetheart.\nTatiana was a doll, too.\n\nGreat service, great food, precious decor (a little too cutesy for me, but it's Starry-eyed splendor in the grass.).\n\nYou got me!",

I will say, however, they are much more considerate of \"regulars\" than walk-ins so perhaps, call first and ask for an appointment with Cyndi, Jen or Nancy.  All 3 ladies are terrific and I get pedicures (regular and spa), manicures (regular, gel, Vinylux/Hybrid, French and nail art) and waxing (eyebrow or underarm) here as needed for both myself and my 14 year old.\n\nWe love coming here - the pedi chairs were recently re-done and are much nicer now.  Large selection of over 800 polishes (300 classic/hybrid) 400 gel and about 100 \"dip\" colors.\n\nI tried 5 or 6 salons (including the much lauded \"Zen Nails\" and the now defunct and awful \"Nail 452\") when we moved here and Trendy's got my money and my vote every time.\n\nPlus, you can walk over to Starbucks if they are too busy to take you right away (again - walk-ins).  Tip:  Come here on a weekday morning for much better service.  Saturdays and Sundays are crazy-busy.\n\nCyndi, Jen and Nancy are who I see (all 3 are equally wonderful).  A few of my other ladies have left and new ones are here but I do not yet know their work.  Cyndi's gel work is amazing, Nancy is great at everything and Jen's pedis and Classic or Hybrid manis are long lasting and meticulously applied.\n\nGood nails are only as good as the strength of the nail technician and these 3 ladies know their stuff. Go Trendy!",

They offer a \"Bespoke\" ocffee tasting service where they will come to your office or home and fresh grind,brew and allow you to sample numerous types of single origin or single estate beans.\n\nKen is a true \"coffee geek\" and is extremely knowledgeable about all aspects of coffee production.  He buys his beans green and roasts them in the Peregrine Roaster in Tacony.\n\nWe had 5 friends over for a Bespoke Coffee Tasting party and could not have been more pleased.  They will even package smaller amount of coffee as wedding favors.  (Oh, where were they when we needed them 6 months ago!!!?)\n\nAll this, and to top it off they are the nicest, smartest people you could hope to meet.\n\nWe hope to have more tastings with them.\n\nThat KenyaAA was something to taste!  (So complex and delicious.)\n\nYou will never want Dunkin' again!!!!   (Don't even get me started on Charbucks.)",

    "text": "Our party of 6 had a truly wonderful lunch during \"Taco Week\" at Condesa.  We all opted for the $22 three-course deal - choice of app, entr\u00e9e and dessert.\n\nThe Aqua Fresca that day was a delightful guava, lemon and mint.  It reminded me of guava lemonade.  I had a splash of it over sparkling water to cut my carbs - and it was mighty tasty.\n\nThe fresh guac was truly flavorful with fresh cilantro and sliced mini-jalapenos.  Just the right amount of kick.\n\nFor an entr\u00e9e I opted for the Platos of pork with onions and nopales - which I happen to love.  The pork itself was just perfectly seasoned and the right amount of fat and lean.  Juice.  Succulent.  Rich tasting.  And oh-so-not-Kosher.  Sorry, G-d.\n\n3 of the 6 people got lamb tacos (on bluecorn tortillas) and everyone was raving.\n\nFor dessert there were a variety of fresh Mexican pastries and a moist, warm (again, delightful) Olive Oil cake.    Too many carbs for me - but worth the splurge.\n\nThe food, d\u00e9cor and service here (even the mod-chic ladies room) were all stellar.  So great.\n\nPricey, yes - but the $22 three course is a great deal if you can get that.\n\nI can't wait to come back.",

James (the manager - NOTE:  He left about a month later - fall of 2012) and I communicated for months beforehand and the actual day was picture perfect.\n\nDelicious food (We offered a soup/salad course and a choice of 4 entrees) and wonderful service by Lucas and the other servers. People raved about the perfectly cooked salmon and filet mignon as well as the delectable chicken/penne dish.\n\nChambers even allowed us to bring our own cake - and graciously sliced and served it for us.\n\nWe are so very pleased with our 5-star party at Chambers!\nI wish James was still around.",

(We did not split any entrees - we ordered 2 apps and 4 entrees).  When we objected they removed it from the bill - but it just seemed cheesy to charge $5.00 to split an app.  (The split-plated it for us - but we did not request that and would have happily picked off each others plates).\n\nAlso, the desserts are kind of a downer.  (Only2 or 3 to chosse from and no pastry chef on site.)  Save room and head to Capogiro for dessert!\n\nBut you gotta try that duck breast.  (Cherry gastriche)  HEAVEN on a plate!",

Tonight was my innaugural experience here - and (even with no reservation - on a Sunday night) we got a great table.\n\nWe had 2 lovely female servers and everything my friend (a fellow yelper) and I ate was just wonderful.\n\nWe both started with salads.  She had the Goat cheese, walnut and mixed greens, I had the beet and fresh fennel salad - and subbed goat for bleu cheese.   My salad was truly dreamy - and almost like eating 3 salads in one.  It was artfully presented ring-mold style with the top layer (salad No. 1) being a mache mix in a light and PERFECTLY balanced vinaigrette (just the right blend of acid and oil).\n\nUnder the mache layer was salad #2 - a crunchy, cold layer of shaved fresh fennel with (again) the perfect dressing ratio.  Now - you must understand that I am the quintessential \"on the side\" kind of gal.  I almost always ask for dressings and sauces \"on the side\" - but here I did not - and I am glad.  The salad was PERFECTLY dressed.\n\nAround the edge of the plate was sub-salad number 3 - sliced, sweet, red beets and toasted pine nuts.\n\nThis salad was worth every blessed penny of the $12.\n\nFor an entree I chose a \"small plate\" (which was not small -more like medium size) of 8 butternut squash filled ravioli in a delectable brown butter and sage sauce.  (Not diet friendly - but I asked for light on the sauce and it was not too heavy).  The pasta was tender and perfectly cooked and every bite was delicious.\n\nFor dessert we shared a (dated, I know - but this one was awesome) molten lava cake, served with 2 generous blobs of home-made whipped cream - each topped with a strawberry fan.\n\n2 cups of coffee later (the house blend is custom roasted for Fri. Sat. Sun. and it is yummy) we were so darned happy!\n\nWhat a wonderful evening.  The ambience (this is a GREAT date place, dimly lit, romantic vibe), music (mellow '60's), service and food were all TOP NOTCH.\n\nThis ain't no Garces/Starr/Industrial place.  It's not slick.  It's an urban townhouse rest-o and as Arnold Schwartzenager might say...\n\n\"I'l be baaack...\"\n\nI can't WAIT to go back.",

(Diet permitting.)\n\nI wish Rebecca and Flying Monkey all the success in the world!\n\nKeep on baking, ladies (and gent.).\n\nOh - she used to make great chocolate truffles, too.  Don't know if they are offered these days.\n\nDon't miss the specialty cupcakes.  WOW!!!  She gives Buttercup and Magnolia (bakeshops in NYC) a run for their money.\n\nGo, Monkey, go!!!!",

They also make very heavy (but I think tasty) potato salad and cole slaw.  YUMMY all-white meat Chicken salad, too.\n\nVERY expensive for what it is - picnic food - but we love to get take out meals from Gross'.\n\nYears ago you could get the most amazing frozen meat (and cheese - but I liked the meat better) ravioli here, too - but alas, no longer.\n\nWant a neat idea for a quick picnic?  Don't feel like cooking?  Like tasty chicken?\n\nTry Gross'.\n\nIt's NOT at all gross.",

Once cut open, the tomato had been cored and stuffed with a delicious pesto.  Interesting presentation.\n\nThe tuna tartar is still on the bar menu ($10) but has been re-vamped and is better than ever.\n\nDrinks are just $5 for the delicious sweet-tea-like Daly Pear and the always tasty William B.

(Next time we'll try the meat bun).\n\nFor dim sum we had the superb Shanghai Pork Soup Dumplings.  #Bliss.\nThe har gao (crystal shrimp dumplings) were tasty (kiddo's fave) but my favorite were the pan fried beef dumplings.  Wow.\n\nI am sold and can't wait to return.  Next time we shall try the scallion pancake and 2 kinds of Shu Mai.\n\nNever met a dumpling I didn't like - but these are terrific.\nChinatown (a cleaner, more yuppified version) has come to \"downtown\" Media!\n\nUpdate:  We went again on 8/15 and who did we see working there?  SABRINA!  We love her.  She introduced us to the fabulous sweet potato cake for dessert.  We also tried the Shanghai Shumai (very good), more har gao (LOVE THEM) and an order of the pork & chive dumplings.   One of the best bites?  The cold, marinated sliced pork.  Soooooo good.",

In reality this is a 4 star place, but the way our group of 31 people (20 of which were children ages 2-7) was treated deserves kudos.\n\nKumar and Mohammed helped me to plan and execute a large Indian dinner for my 5 yesar old's Pre-K class, their parents and siblings.\n\nOrinigally we planned on 12 -15 guests and each family would simply order what they wished and pay for their share.  Well plans changed..  and the guest list ballooned to 20, then 24, then 27 and finally 31.\n\nWe decide to go to a set menu - and people got to choose from 5 entrees including Chicken Tikka (plain for the kids or Masala), Lamb Korma, Shrimp Shag, Malai Kofta (for our vegetarian friends) or 3 kinds of Biryani.\n\nAppetizers were great and included a smooth Muligatawny (Lentil) soup, Crispy Samosas (yum!) and Chana Chat - chikpeas in a tamarind sauce.\n\nThe kids plowed their way through 18 Lassi in Mango, Strawberry and Pomegranite.\n\nWe had our tables arranged in a large \"U\" shape for lots of interaction.\nI only pity the other diners that night (a few tables on a Wednesday night) who witnessed the chaos.  Those kids had a BLAST.\n\nThe servers and kitchen worked hard - and in the end the dinner was enjoyed very much.  Plus we introduced a whole group of young children to many new foods - including the yummy breads (which the loved) naan, paratha and poori.\n\nIt's not on the menu by itself - but ask them to make you a poori - it's (fattening and) delicious.\n\nOh - and those who stayed for dessert (many left early for bedtime) enjoyed Mango and Pistachio kulfi.\n\nTHANK YOU to the staff of King of Tandoor.",

The tuna lovers plate ($42, includes 2 pieces of chu-toro), naked tuna on crispy rice, oshi-tashi with bonito and succulent salmon tartar were all sheer perfection.\n\nSwimmingly fresh.\n\nFabulous service, nothing \"shi-shi\" or hipster or fancy, just amazingly good sashimi, nigiri and maki.\n\nWe love you and sister-restaurant Doma, too.\n\nRun, don't walk, to Shiroi Hana today!",
