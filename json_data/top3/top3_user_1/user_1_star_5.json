I have been here twice already and, although pricey - and sometimes unbearably crowded, I will be back again and again.  It's Xo-Good!\n\nThe Aussie Bartender is muy, muy caliente!\nTry a couple of Dona Florinda cocktails with fresh prickly pear cactus fruit.  Super Yum!",

DiBruno Brother's couldn;t help us.  Neither could Dunkin Donuts, nor Cappriccio (though the manager tried).\n\nThe coffee favors available on \"wedding\" websites as favors is sub-par pre-bagged swill.\n\nWe wanted QUALITY - and with La Colombe - our guests got it - for reasonable coin, too.\n\nWe ordered a case (96 pouches) of the house blend and bagged each pouch in a cute little tulle bag, and added a Yankee Candle \"buttercream\" votive.  Between the coffe and the cream - our closet smelled heavenly.\n\nThe coffee favors were a huge hit and La Colombe is the ONLY Philly coffee place to come through for us.",

They make their own mozzarella, and bake fresh brick-oven pizza on a thin - but not-too-thin crust.\n\nThe shrimp scampi is ENORMOUS - they give you over a dozen shrimp.\nIt is garlicky & oily - so if you order it light on the garlic 'n oil it's even better (IMHO).\n\nThe Veal Parm is a flam-family (that's FLAMILY) staple and my mom & I can easily split it.  (Comes with a side of pasta.)\n\nFresh (onion-y) bruschetta arrives on the table nearly as soon as you are seated.\n\nCappucino is light and frothy.

Media Bean Company now brings their fabulous breads, pies, FOCCACIA PIZZA ($4 a slice and worth every penny) and artesanal baked good to the Media Farmers Market on Sundays from 9 AM - 1 PM.\n\nWe just love that pizza - especially the kind with fresh mozzarella, fresh basil (with or without a balsamic drizzle).  My 13 year old gets 2 slices to go from the market and they are usually mostly gone by the time we drive home.\n\nSoooooo delicious - and supports working people with disabilities.\n\nKeep it up, Media Bean Co!",

    "text": "OK, here's the secret to having a 5 star experience at Amada - go on a slower night (like a Monday during the summer) so that you can be seated comfortably and the noise level won't be too deafening (this is a LOUD, busy place).\n\nGo with a crowd - we had 7 ladies and ordered 2 plates each.  Sounds like not enough?  WRONG!!!  Many of the choices are heavy. (Even at tapas size.)\n\nStandouts amoung the 14 different items we tried?\n\nGambas (your basic garlic shrimp - done just right), Flatbread with Artichokes (divine), Yellow tomato gazpacho (perfect on a summer night) was garnished with crab salad and avocado ice cream (Yes - a savory icecream pluche).\n\nThe crab-stuffed peppers were so incredibly creamy, crabby and tasty we ordered one more plateful.  (So I guess we had 15 dishes among 7 ladies).\n\nThe plate of veggies (can't remember the name) was simple and perfect - tomato, pepper, onion and a delectable eggplant dip.  It was accompanied by crispy-thin bread smeared lightly with a chive goat cheese.  HEAVENLY.\n\nLamb meatballs were too rare (nearly raw)  for most of the groups liking, but the sherry cream sauce and fresh green peas were tasty.\n\nThe salad with figs and blue cheese came literally wrapped in Jamon.  Weird and not my bag - but it, too, disappeared.\n\nMeanwhile, they ARE heavy handed with the salt and the (salty) cheeses - so if you KNOW this (you, smart -yelper-who-pre-reads before you go, you!)  Ask for items light on the (salt) (Cheese) (Sauce) etc.\n\nI can't wait to come back here - at an off time - with more than 2 other people.\n\n2 dishes apiece for 7 people came to $280 (including tax 'n tip) including ONE sangria each.  (Well, not I, I had 2 virgin mojitos with a splash of pineapple juice).  \n\nJose, baby,  you live up to your hype.\n\nAnd I have now been to all 5 Philly Garces joints.  Huzzah!\n\nOh - and if you don't eat pork or shellfish - you'll have a TOUGH time here.  And if you are vegan - fuggedaboutit!  (Dairy is hidden in things)",

Everything from the decor and service once inside (the receptionists rudely demand that EVERYONE in your party be present before being seated - and they don't reserve for small groups.  BLAH!!!!).

The appetizers are great too and for lunch try the (affordable) enchildas.\n\nExpensive - but so worth it - for true haute-Mexican cuisine.

    "text": "5 stars for service from Emily (and the male manager and a pink-haired server who's name I did not catch).\n\nEmily served our group of 9 ladies for a long-awaited and long-planned Happy Hour.\n\nWe got a large table (a few tables pushed together) in the back and ordered apps to share (delicious fried Brussel's sprouts and thick-cut sweet potato fries with 2 delectable dipping sauces - try the vanilla sauce).\n\nFolks ordered their own drinks and dinners - but 4 of us had the pan-seared scallops with a creamy risotto.  DIVINE.\n\nOur only complaint?  The $15 nachos (close to $20 if you want chicken) used to be an enormous platter - not anymore.   The nachos are still wonderful but you get much less - plenty for 3 people - but not for 9.\n\nThe 5 stars goes for the tremendous service including separate checks and rushing in a happy hour order (Iron Hill's Happy Hour drink specials end at 6 PM!!!!) for us.\n\nSo glad I planned my Ladies Night Happy Hour here.",

    "text": "I hosted a party for a group of 20 at Iron Hill and things went WAY better than ever expected or imagined.\n\nWe enjoyed delicious nachos, wings, guacamole, crab quesadilla, cheesesteak egg rolls and a few folks ordered dinners.  There were Salmon, Scallops  - and my 9 year-old demolished a big plate of fettuccine carbonara (Ah to be 9 again and to be able to eat like that). Desserts like cheesecake and the Chocolate Brownie Sundae (it has a special name) were show stoppers. (And many pints of Raspberry Wheat were consumed as well).\n\nWe are so pleased and grateful to our server, Megan and all the expediters, servers, bussers and hosts/greeters for a wonderful and fun evening.\n\nI would not hesitate to recommend Iron Hill to friends and colleagues when planning their holiday parties or other group events.\n\nWhat a great experience.\n\nBrava!",

All delicious.\n\nPerfectly marinated ikura (salmon roe) - although for $5.00 a piece - the portion was very tiny.  (Like 18 eggs or so.  Come on, guys!)\n\nAnd for \"dessert\" 2 perfect slices of house-made tamago (none of that frozen garbage here!).\n\nDomo! Domo!\n\nI am infatuated (once again) with Zama.  Decor is Zen, sleek & lovely.  (Look up to see the giant Koi above you.)\n\n$60 including tax 'n tip (no alcohol) is pretty steep though.  My husband may freak out on me.  It also underscores what a GREAT value Doma is and how high-priced Morimoto is.  (Zama is right in between.)",

I can judge the margarita when there is no fruit muddled in, no chi-chi twists, just pure Margarita goodness.\n\nMy dining companion and I both started with salads - the chopped salad - topped with crispy tortilla strips in a luscious buttermilk-chipotle dressing, and the GRENADA - you HAVE to try this in season - it is topped with a layer of jewel-like pomegranates and roasted pepitas.  Crunchy, crisp and fruity with a bite from the pequin.  YUM-I-NESS!!!\n\nThen we had the House-made chips, salsa and guacamole (10 - yikes!).  The chips and salsa were top notch and re-orderable - but with all the other great things to eat this is (*gasp* - can't believe I'm about to say this...)...\n\n...the first time that Guacamole was an afterthought for me at a Mexican restaurant.\n\nXochitl's guac was better - had a better flavor profile and was table-side prepared.  Not so at Distrito.\n\nAnyhow, we had a superb side order on Plantains & Crema (De-lump-scious).\n\nMy friend had the chicken tacos (not so great - sauce seemed to be an odd concontion of Hot Sauce, Sugar and Barbecue sauce.  Not a fave - but still edible.  I had the \"quesdailla\" - which looked more like fried pierogies, stuffed with w super-yummy pumpkin (calabaza) and cheese mix.  So decadent.\n\nWe were sooooo full by now - but could not resist the Churros - and were we glad we ordered them.  (Even better than Xochitl's)  9 mini churritos sprinkled with a vanilla bean sugar and served with a small (wish there was more...) scoop of home-made coffee ice cream  (WOW!!!!) and a tall shot glass full of warm Mexican chocolate and a top layer of dulche du leche.  ADDICTIVE!!!!    One could have easily downed the shot and licked the glass.\n\nOn weekends (we were in luck) there is a talented Mariachi singer.  He belted out Billy Joel's \"Piano Man\" in Spanish.  Service was attentive but I did feel rushed - especially when nearly everything came out at once - it was like \"SENSORY OVERLOAD\".  Our great looking male server helped!  It was also very, very loud in there.\n\nI would like to come back her on a Tuesday at 5 PM or another \"off time\" so I can hear myself think.\nI hovered between 4 & 5 stars and went with the five - because it really is a remarkable restaurant.  (Much better than Tinto.  I am jonsein' to finally try Amada.)\n\nThe bill for 2 including - only 1 alcoholic drink - tip & tax was exactly $80.00.",

    "text": "Last night's visit was sooooooo fabulous.  We were smart and made a reservation for the 3 of us - we took our 5 year old DD who just LOVES (and ate 6 of) the jumbo shrimp shumai.\n\nService was great considering how frantically busy they were (they had to turn people away) on a Friday night.\n\nMy husband's sushi was great - especially the crunchy spicy tuna roll.\nI had the (ENORMOUS) Zen bento box which came with delectable tempura and 4 pieces of sushi, plus kalbi, 1 shumai (we got a little shumai'ed out) and a spicy tuna roll.  (Yum!)\n\nIf you are a big eater consider the $36 Zen box - comes with miso soup (GREAT and homemade), salad (tasty soy-based dressing) and dessert.\n\nAs a surprise - and mostly why I am giving them 5 stars is that they brought our daughter a HUGE platter ($14 on the menu) called the Doma Dessert Sampler.  (FOR FREE.)\n\nThe dessert sampler came with:\n\nVanilla ice cream topped with green-tea cream cheese and a fresh blueberry\n\nMochi-covered Strawberries (home-made mochi) with a small pot of fudge to dip them in (WOW).\n\n3 fried banana-tempura drizlled in (more) chocolate sauce and caramel sauce.\n\nAnd a MOLTEN chocolate lava cake.\n\nIt was a HUGE platter of dessert - and easily fed all 3 of us (who, by the way, were already stuffed from dinner).  Somehow we managed to eat it.  (Ha!)  What a treat.  And how nice of them to do this for us.\n\nMy little one already adores DOMA and now I am quite sure it has surpassed Roy's and Swanky Bubbles (2 of my little one' faves) as her favorite restaurant.\n\nMan, I wish my parents had taken me to places like Doma when I was 5.\n(Yes, she was the ONLY kid in the joint - this is not a kiddie place.)\n\nKid's got good taste.

    "text": "Amazing!  A hair's breadth away from 5 stars - so I'mma gonna do it and give them all five - and especially Marina our kind, patient server who was so accommodating.\n\nFirstly, my dining companion and I walked in 45 minutes EARLY for our 8 PM res.  This is a hostesses nightmare and we were prepared to be told to \"sit at the bar\" but we got a table (in the bar area) right away.\n\nI had 2 of the tastiest Arnold Palmers you can imagine - made with the herb-infused house sun tea.\n\nEverything we ate from the fluffy warm brioche rolls with ramp butter to the delicate \"handkerchief\" pasta (mine with umami rich rabbit, my friends was vegetarian) to the luscious side of garden beets (at least 2 varieties of beet - possibly 3 it was hard to tell) and candied orange peel and a touch of creamy fresh ricotta. - All was wonderful - but the real showpiece was the special of SEASON ONLY squash blossoms (which I love!!!) delicately fried - stuffed with goat cheese and herbs.\n\nCalorie-city!  But so tasty - and we shared an order of 4 - so 2  seemed just about decadently perfect.\n\nWe also splurged and shared a Millefuille (more like quatrefuille - please tell me somebody gets my jokes...) of thinly sliced banana, toffee and chocolate served with a rich yet delicate quenelle (aka the Quenelle from hell) of dark chocolate sorbet. \n\nWow.\n\nBeets (pun intended) the heck outta Parc.\nSimilar price points but somehow we spent WAY less (no $60 seafood cocktail tonight, thank you very much).\n\nDinner for 2 with soft drinks and 1 dessert (no alcohol) was around $75 before tip.\n\nI can't wait to go back.\n\nGO TO TALULA'S. \nGo!\nGo!\nGo!\n\nAnd ask for Marina - what a sweetheart.\nTatiana was a doll, too.\n\nGreat service, great food, precious decor (a little too cutesy for me, but it's Starry-eyed splendor in the grass.).\n\nYou got me!",

    "text": "Our party of 6 had a truly wonderful lunch during \"Taco Week\" at Condesa.  We all opted for the $22 three-course deal - choice of app, entr\u00e9e and dessert.\n\nThe Aqua Fresca that day was a delightful guava, lemon and mint.  It reminded me of guava lemonade.  I had a splash of it over sparkling water to cut my carbs - and it was mighty tasty.\n\nThe fresh guac was truly flavorful with fresh cilantro and sliced mini-jalapenos.  Just the right amount of kick.\n\nFor an entr\u00e9e I opted for the Platos of pork with onions and nopales - which I happen to love.  The pork itself was just perfectly seasoned and the right amount of fat and lean.  Juice.  Succulent.  Rich tasting.  And oh-so-not-Kosher.  Sorry, G-d.\n\n3 of the 6 people got lamb tacos (on bluecorn tortillas) and everyone was raving.\n\nFor dessert there were a variety of fresh Mexican pastries and a moist, warm (again, delightful) Olive Oil cake.    Too many carbs for me - but worth the splurge.\n\nThe food, d\u00e9cor and service here (even the mod-chic ladies room) were all stellar.  So great.\n\nPricey, yes - but the $22 three course is a great deal if you can get that.\n\nI can't wait to come back.",

Well plans changed..  and the guest list ballooned to 20, then 24, then 27 and finally 31.\n\nWe decide to go to a set menu - and people got to choose from 5 entrees including Chicken Tikka (plain for the kids or Masala), Lamb Korma, Shrimp Shag, Malai Kofta (for our vegetarian friends) or 3 kinds of Biryani.\n\nAppetizers were great and included a smooth Muligatawny (Lentil) soup, Crispy Samosas (yum!) and Chana Chat - chikpeas in a tamarind sauce.\n\nThe kids plowed their way through 18 Lassi in Mango, Strawberry and Pomegranite.\n\nWe had our tables arranged in a large \"U\" shape for lots of interaction.\nI only pity the other diners that night (a few tables on a Wednesday night) who witnessed the chaos.  Those kids had a BLAST.\n\nThe servers and kitchen worked hard - and in the end the dinner was enjoyed very much.  Plus we introduced a whole group of young children to many new foods - including the yummy breads (which the loved) naan, paratha and poori.\n\nIt's not on the menu by itself - but ask them to make you a poori - it's (fattening and) delicious.\n\nOh - and those who stayed for dessert (many left early for bedtime) enjoyed Mango and Pistachio kulfi.\n\nTHANK YOU to the staff of King of Tandoor.",

    "text": "Omg! Came back to Shiroi after nearly 7 years and they treated us like celebrities.  The tuna lovers plate ($42, includes 2 pieces of chu-toro), naked tuna on crispy rice, oshi-tashi with bonito and succulent salmon tartar were all sheer perfection.\n\nSwimmingly fresh.\n\nFabulous service, nothing \"shi-shi\" or hipster or fancy, just amazingly good sashimi, nigiri and maki.\n\nWe love you and sister-restaurant Doma, too.\n\nRun, don't walk, to Shiroi Hana today!",
