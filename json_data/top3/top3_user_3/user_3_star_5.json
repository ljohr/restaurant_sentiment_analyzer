    "text": "I would said this restaurant is unique in many ways. The cuisine, the setting of the restaurant, the attention of owner make the place great to eat. There are gluten free item and grass feed beef as their advertisements of the material of the food. \n\nI like to mention a little about their sound system. It is front row seat to the concert. The restaurant invest a very good sound system that is pleasure to the ear. They also hide their speaker very well. Imagine they play the Star Wars music. May the force be with you. \n\nWe have order the taste of the islands and the blacken mango salmon. The taste of the island include curry goat, Ox tail and jerk chicken. The goat is a bit heavy smell. The jerk chicken is great with the seasoning they have. The best is the Ox Tail. The Ox tail with Caribbean spice make this dish special.\n\nThe blacken salmon is prepare with Caribbean blacken spice. It is very nice. It serves over cook pineapple sauce. The fish is tasty. This dish accompanied with a side salad. The desert we have is the coconut cake. The coconut cake has layers of coconut cream. It is guilty pleasure. \n\nThe greeting of the owner from the restaurant make this place special. The decorations is modern and it is gear up for upper class power lunch or dinner. Nice touch. Service is great and the cook is the owner wife. It is family run with attention to the details.",

Since we have 7 in the group, we have ordered the Family Dinner. It is a whole chicken with salad, fried yuca, and cilantro rice. The salad is fresh with vinaigrette dressing. I like the cilantro rice with spice in rice. The chicken is marinated and slowly roasted with the skin is crispy outside. We have added the tostones - the flatten fried green plantain for other member to experience the food. \n\nWe also ordered the Cuenellis Special - Palomilla Steak with fried egg. The steak is well season and tasty, however, the steak may need to be tenderizing for better chewing. The dish also come with fried yuca, 1/4 chicken and fried sweet plantain. A lot food for affordable meal.",

    "text": "This is my special review for a single vender in the French Market. The reason that they need special attention is due to the unique food that they are prepared. If you visit the French Market, do not miss up the opportunity to try their food. Their vender stand is located at the last vender stand of the food venders at first open air structure. It is very much at the middle of two open air structures. \n\nThey occupied three vender stands and a front open air stand. You will not miss it. The front vender stand offers the roast cone and broil peanut. They roasted their corn in the enclose smoker. Once they receive the order, they will peel off the skin and show the ear. Then they will dip the corn to the hot butter, and season with salt, parmesan cheese (yum), Cajun spice (wow). My wife loves this corn. The inner vender stand serves the deep fried corn, crab cake, gator bites, and frog leg. They also serve different type of fruit drink and icy. We were curious the deep fry corn did not turn to pop corn. The vender owner assures us it will not happen. Evidently, it does not and coated with thin cajun coating. I have concluded the deep fried corn is a boy food and the roast corn is girl food base on the preference.\n\nWe also order the home made crab cake. The surprise is not the crab cake; it is the side dish that comes with it. The deep fried kale. I have the deep fried kale at the Cool Bean restaurant in Tallahasse FL. I did not expect they are as good as the restaurant grade. The Kale is deep fried for 30 second then season. The best thing is when you put on the tongue and the kale melt like cotton candy. The vender did a very good job.",

    "text": "I am using this restaurant to mark my 100 review. This will be the restaurant I will likely repeat when I come back to New Orleans. This is one of my favorite restaurants in New Orleans. Each reservation or walk in is allowed for 1.5 hours dining in the prime evening by the restaurant. The restaurant offer blue music while eating. The musician is very good and talented. They can kick into high gear or take it slow like Big Easy. \n\nThis restaurant located Marigny area. This is a hypies area. Many people around this area are care free. But the restaurant is considered a high end even though they are located in this area. We love the performance by the musician. The guitar and harmonica have their solo highlight display the talented tune. The singer also great and the song is about the daily life. \n\nTonight we have order the Two Run Farms Lamb Sliders, Beer Braised Kurobuta Pork Belly, Bleu Cheese Stuffed Dates, Seared Scallops, Crab Dra Diavolo Cannolloni and Deviled Yard Egg. Most of the dishes have a choice of small or large quantity. Our first dish is the Deviled Yard Egg. The egg filling include seasoned egg yolk. It garnish with seasoned chop vege and top with deep fry broccoli flower. You will experience with crispy, sweet vege, and salty paste taste. The second dish Bleu Cheese Stuffed Dates. The Dates wrap in bacon and drizzle with sweet vanilla balsamic vinaigrette. The Bleu Cheese is stuff in the Dates and the combination allow for salty first then sweet (bacon to sweet dates). The third dish is  pork belly. This is my favorite dish in the restaurant. The pork belly is slice in rectangular cube. They pork belly is actually braise to soft the texture then slightly sear at the outside. It place on Chinese flat bread and garnish in the pickle cucumber. When you place the pork belly at your tongue, you can feel the pork belly fat actually melt away. This is actually a Chinese technique to cook the pork belly in pressure cooker and braise in slow fire. This is a dish should not miss. The fourth dish is the Crab Dra Diavolo Cannolloni. This is fresh pasta with spicy crab meat filling. It is cook with tomato sauce with caper.  The pasta is refreshing. The fifth dish is the Lamb Slider. The lamb meat is grounded and seasoned. It cooks over the open flame and top with tomato creamy sauce. The last dish is the seared scallop. The scallop is seared and serve with charizo, red lentils and bok chai. \n\nOverall we enjoy the great music over the meal. I have order the local brewer beer - southern pecan beer. It is great to go with the meal. The service is great. I am award this restaurant with five star to start my 3 digit review.",

Pokeworks located at the mall near the food court. \n\nI did take advantage on their grand opening special but one get one free. We have free samples of the sorbet ice while we wait on the line. I like their choices on the base, ingredients, topping. At the base they have a choice that no poke place has it yet - the kale noodle. It is delicious. On the topping, they have and item like fried slice lotus root. That is unique at it on way. \n\nIn addition, they mix the ingredients separately with sauce or flavor. Their worker are well train and costume to your order. They ask you you want light, medium or heavy sauce. It give you adjustment for not too sweet or salty of your food. Great choice. I am a fan for this poke. Many other poke store need to learn from them.",

It has an outdoor red umbrella and Columbia flag in front of the store. \n\nIf you are here, got to try their ice coffee. They use whole milk or 2% milk to stir up with mocha coffee. It use food processor to grind the ice and coffee and milk. Very delicious. \n\nThe pastry is another best. Got to try their sweet corn and cheese item. The pastry includes beef and chicken fluffy pastry. Other than it. It has many pastry to select. Some thing sweet or salty. \n\nPrice are affordable. Many Columbian has done here. The store server know a little English only. So point you finger. Don't worry about price. You will love and they are affordable.",

However, it is worth a trip for taste and unique of the food. \n\nThis restaurant only has three elite members review including me. This restaurant needs to make know. I would say this is a very creative on taste and combination of the ingredient. \n\nWe have Ahi Poke, Out of Control Roll, Tampa Roll, and Spicy Tuna Roll. The Ahi Poke is Ahi tuna seared with shichimi pepper and tossed w. hot sesame oil, sriracha sauce, scallions, and masago. Served on crispy wonton chips, and avocado. It is a bit spicy but the preparation of the roll requires time in cooking, chopping, assembling, and decorating. It top with eel sauce and set on the fried wonton skin and make a beautiful presentation. \n\nThe out of control roll is never out of control. The flavor is well control and sophisticate. This roll is tuna, salmon, kani & avocado inside, tuna, salmon & yellow- tail w. mayo & seared across, caviar on top w. eel sauce and scallion. This roll require dear across the roll top with eel sauce and masago. This is another creation of the chef. \n\nI would recommend order from the Uchi special roll section if you are here. The service is good. This place is a bit pricy but worth the money to try special roll.",

They have many good things going on this food truck. I round them to 5 stars. \n\nIf you come here, you got to try their halo halo. Their halo halo is different than most Philippino cuisine. The bean and jelly are home made. The juice is jackfruit juice. Very special. Best halo halo in town. \n\nThis food truck is popular here. A lot of customers. They do have the seating area. But I rather take it to go during pandemic. The menu changes every day. When they sold out they will not continue make it until next day. \n\nWe got the Bistek. It is sirloin beef steak simmering in soy sauce. The serve with rice and lumpia. I would only give them an average on this dish. The second dish is much better choice. It is the saut\u00e9ed mung bean. It serve with the fried scad fish. The bean is one of the kind. I would recommend this dish. Fish is good. You have to chose tail or head section.",

Because Dale Mabry Carrollwood area is definitely a restaurant pocket. With that said, I think will be a good contributor to the community with great food with easy selection. \n\nI like the new restaurant with outside seating that allow many dog owners gladly visit the restaurant. This is a plus in many way just by sacrificing a few parking space with outside seating. \n\nThe restaurant Mediterranean cuisine has a lot to offer. You can have kabob, bowl, sandwich, pita, salad, and piadinas. We got the salmon bowl with Mediterranean Salad Trio. I am good with that. The best is salmon kabob with roasted veggies and quinoa. This is very good dish. The salmon is fresh and grilled very well. I like roasted veggies with a lot flavor. I would go for double roasted veggies incomparable to quinoa. \n\nThe manager did make around our table to see how is our food. I also like to suggest the Mediterranean Lamb Kafka as starter if you happen to visit them.",

The steak, grilled pork, cow tongue, pork in green salsa. I like the steak taco. You know they have good taco because the steak is not pre-cook and re-cook when people order (the meat will be too dry). As a result the meat is tender and juicy. I heard they have the shrimp taco special on Friday. I will be back to try that. \n\nThey are about 4.5 stars restaurant in my opinion. I award them to five stars due to a lot of meat is pack to one taco, juicy, great taste, nice garnish.

Xi'an cuisine is famous on flat noodle, beef rougamo , or hand pull noodle. Love it. \n\nWe start with the beef rougamo - beef pita. The beef is slice beef shank with spicy marinated. I've the beef. I may not necessarily like the pita. We also got the Yummy chicken nuggets. The coating is panko crispy with a bit of Cummings. \n\nOur main dish is braise beef hand pull noodle.

The final dish is the chicken with dry chili. It has good high BTU wok technique. Next time, we will order the broil fish with bean sprouts. \n\nI can say the restaurant is 4.5 stars.

I think they have changed their system a lot since then. \n\nBefore it they have menu in Japanese and customers take a lot of time try to understand what they eat. Now they just have pictures at the entrance and you order and paid at the entrance. Easier and cut down the time try to explain and make the process slow. \n\nWe have order the Ramen and grilled squid. The squid was slice after grilled and go with their home made sauce. The ramen is close to what we have eat in Japan. As a result we like their authenticity.",

This is one of the golf courses you can know about your driving golf ball distance. \n\nIt doesn't matter it rain or shine, this place can handle both conditions. We were there when Tampa has been rain for a week. I actually like to play when it rain in summer time. Summer in Tampa for outdoor is brutal even with the sun down. Rain actually cools it down for this cover open air activities. \n\nWe like the food there with bite can be share with many people. We have steak flat bread, Mushi, and buffalo chicken slider. The Mushi is chicken roll in jalape\u00f1o tortilla. They have many pieces to share. I would consider they have many selection of the party food. \n\nMy friend shows me the games system of the golf. I am just a recreation golfer may be golf 1 time every three years. You will know I am not the skill golfer. My friend indicate to me that is better for me since I am not the serious golfer and I will enjoy more in Top Golf games. Serious golfers loose the fun of this place since they ask for their perfection of their skill. \n\nThey also have games indoor with pool table, games console with motion and more. The games are free inside.  However, the price of golf is double after 6 pm.",

    "text": "I like to thank Nick S. for the notice to this restaurant. It located at Temple Terrace northwest corner of Whiteway Drive and 56 street the Temple Terrace Village Plaza. This is Peruvian restaurant. The restaurant owner are Elizabeth and her husband. Her husband is the cook. The restaurant just started December 26 2014. Elizabeth is from Columbia and her husband is from Peru. Peruvian grilled meat is very tasty. \n\nThe lunch and dinner menu seem like the same. We have order the Falda and Lomo de Cerdo - grilled skirt steak and grilled pork chop tenderloin. The Falda is equivalent to Churrasco in Argentine dish. The meat should be at the low section of cow a long flat cut of skirt steak from the \"plate\" of the cow. The skirt steak is actually diaphragm muscle of the cow but in low section. Some one may serve you the skirt steak on the upper section which not as good as the low section. This restaurant also serve the upper section skirt steak dish call Vacio. Which is internal flank plate. Today the Falda came with the home made chimichurri sauce. You also allow to select one side. I have select the sweet plantain. All dish came with salad in the plate. To eat Falda, cut along the meat to the direction of the meat grain with small strip. You will enjoy more with cut since the Falda come in strip against the meat grain. I can finally said I found a reasonable price churrasco that comparable to Cuban churrasco that serve in Miami ($18.95) at Tampa. My wife dish is the grill pork chop. Seem like the preparation is first fried then grilled. The pork chop is marinate with rosemary, salt and pepper. This chop is good since they are sealing meat juice when they prepare it. \n\nOverall the restaurant is not busy and you get the service from the owner. A few thing they may be able to improve is have the lunch menu price that can attract more customer. Adding the pre-meal item such as bread or soup. The decoration of the restaurant display the mozaic of the local Peruvian art and painting. The restaurant back door is open to ventilating the food smell. So pick the seat close to the front to avoid food smoke.",

We were here when Genghis Flan playing here. Parking is challenge since the restaurant have a lot of traffic. If you come after 7:00 pm, you can park at the value pawn shop after they close. \n\nTonight dinner we have begin with crab stuffed butternut squash. Butternut squash is a very difficult cooking material to be use, however, the chef did a very good job to prepare it with crab meat and citrus hollandaise source. The squash filled with crab meat area is extremely soft and sweet to eat. \n\nOur main course is chicken mole and beef tenderloin. The chicken is very juicy in curry source top over comb read arepa. Who can think about the combination of the dish. It is getting better with the preparation on the beef tenderloin. The dish come with 2 pieces of 4 oz tenderloin in port wine source. It grilled to perfect with beef juice seal inside. This dish also come with bacon wrap asparagus. Bacon is good with any food but who can think the combination of crispy bacon wrap with bacon juice drip into the asparagus. It also come with mash potato cake. The mash is well season and the top is bake to crispy. \n\nI am usually not given out 5 star. The cooking and the mixture of the material and taste is well balance. The food give me a wow and unique factor.",

I wonder they do it here. \n\nWe were here many time for the Sunday morning Thai market and eateries. I like this place because it serve my home country neighbor country food. It is very similar to my country. The food here very similar to the vendors of Friday night market in my home country. Only different is you have to wait on line to order. \n\nAlways come here with two people or more. You need to divide and conquer. The noodle line is long. Here one person in line while the other person go to buy other food. Always put your name down on the coconut ball and it will be ready before you leave the market. Once you got some of the food, feed the person in line for noodle then go get the drink for Thai tea, longan drink or coconut drink. Once got the drink go back to the noodle line to help the bowl of soup noodle. This is always our strategy for this market.  \n\nThe soup noodle is the best. It is very light food. They have thin, medium or widest noodle size to chose. You can chose beef or pork base noodle. \n\nI also like their dessert. Many to chose from. Grill chicken, steak or pork stick is grilled on the spot. The also have wok cook food like the curry, pad Thai and more. \n\nThe best time is November to December and March to May. When it is not too hot. The weather is pleasant. At special event, they perform the Thai traditional dance.",

I really not a fan of it. I like many choices of the ingredients to be add on. Only a few need additional money. Which is I can skip. \n\nMy last visit is the restaurant did give me freedom to separate the rice from the ingredients and sauce. Allow me just to mixed the ingredients only. I also like just select the Ahi tuna and salmon without add into premixed spiciness. This is much better quality because the tuna is dice close to a inch cube. Big size for mixed your on poke. I give them an A in this matter. By separating the ingredients from rice make this mixed more flavorful. Now I can combine many sauces with the raw fish and ingredients. Some of the ingredients included crab salad, corn, mango, red cabbage, cucumber, edamame, masago and more. These are the ingredients included part of the bowl price. \n\nI would love to have the sweet eel sauce, ponzu sauce and poke sauce to add together. This is my favorite mixed sauce. At the end you add the fried onion and fried garlic to add the crunchy and extra taste. \n\nOverall experience is great. We have party of eight and enjoy our moments of poke.

Be brave and order this appetizer. It tastes like regular beef meat. Thank to Steve to organize the UYE Latin Crawler to get to know this restaurant the first time. \n\nThe ambient is nice and the restaurant is pack with people during lunch time. We have the free sample on the appetizer with potato or fried yucca in cream cheese sauce. I like the yucca with cream cheese. \n\nMy entree is fried fish top with shrimp, mussel, and squid in fish broth. The restaurant did a good job on the on the fish broth. If you use the can fish broth, you need to be careful on the saltiness in the mix. This restaurant is balance their broth with a good technique not to overpower the taste and maintain light level of salty. The squid is well prepared with the softness of the texture. The shrimp count may be in the range of 10 to 15 counts a pound which means larger shrimp. When the restaurant prepares seafood you are looking for the fresh material. The seafood is really fresh and keeps in the quality. \n\nThis is a restaurant serve a lot ceviche, Peruvian stir fried or deep fried. I would said they are definite are very good on this end. I have not tried their grilled meat dish and that is yet to come. Service is a bit headache since we have a group of 30. They may be able to improve at in this end when they facing busy condition.",

    "text": "Rare Ethnic Food 4 - Malaysian Cuisine. \n\nFinally we have some restaurant actually represent my country well in Tampa. There are three claiming Malaysian restaurants in Bay Area. This one may be the best representing. Although the restaurant introduce a lot of pan Asia food, but predominantly is Malaysian street food. The Chinese has immigrated to Malaysia long time ago. A mix marriage with local Malay people and create a generation call Nyonya. This people combine the Chinese cuisine and Malay cuisine and ultimately have this mix cultural food. \n\nLaksa is one of the good example. This spicy soup base rice noodle dish is created of the combination of the Chinese rice noodle in the use of Malay lemon grass material. The Prawn Mee is another example. The soup base is spicy Malay spice from shrimp shell and head. The noodle, pork, slice of shrimp are Chinese touch. \n\nChar Kway Teow is stir fry flat rice noodle. In Malaysia you can ask them to add the sambal - spicy shrimp paste in the noodle. It make more interesting. Have you try the Roti Canai. In Malaysia, this item is a hand craft. The chef actually has to stretch this dough to thin piece and pan fried on the hot plate grill. In Malaysia you can ask them to add egg, goat meat, onion. Can you feel the gulai (Malay for curry) of the Roti is different then any curry. It is different from Indian or Thai curry. The spice for Malaysian curry is sophisticate because they use wet curry powder. \n\nI would encourage you step out from your comfort zone to try this Malaysian dish including the mee goreng, Hokkkien mee. Unfortunately the satay here is still not close enough per Malaysian standard. I was able to give them 5 stars is to make sure the Orlando kitchen crews have left and they can stand their own ground to support this store. They did not disappoint me. They are quite good. Food came out in amazing speed.",

I like burn taste of the escolar. The sauce is excellent to go with it. The baked green mussels is chop and mixed with imitation crab meat. It is delicious after the baked. I like to pick up the small pieces and eat it slowly. \n\nThe price is not cheap for the appetizers. But the experience rewards the outcome. I would said about 4.5 stars.

One of my non Yelp friend told me about this place. Plus when you have priority list of the restaurant in you book mark with added distance to travel here, we take me 7 month to hit this book mark. But no regrets and I will return. Blame on Todd and Melissa hidden this place very well :) Can believe I bum to them while I visit. \n\nNow about the restaurant. I like the concept of tapas and open garage. The tapas is very close to small plate. For two people 3 dish is enough but it does not stop you to order more. Instead of spending money for two dish at most restaurant, here you can try one more dish. I also like the open garage drink area with pool table. It make this place lively. \n\nThe skill of the chef. We have order the Miller, Kevin and Destin. We started with The Kevin with Blacken Redfish. The fish was handle well. Most chef either charcoal or not blacken enough. This chef make it just right. Blacken spice burn but not charcoal. The accompanying black-eyes pea and grit is good match. The Destin mixer of seared fillet tip, spice shrimp and sausage (soppressata) make this dish over the top. The many step preparation make this dish great to taste and put in the creamy pasta. My favorite is the miller. You can kill for this dish. The duck breast was marinated and blacken. A good duck breast need to cook roughly at medium rare to medium. The reason is medium rare is too chewy and the medium is to well done. This one just right. It has meaty bite but not chewy. Good technique. I am not going elaborate the accompanying side. Go find out yourself. \n\nService is good. Love the atmosphere and food. Can't wait to return.",

The chicken masala is good curry to go with rice or the nan. Their nan is not at the buffet tray which is I agree, they bring fresh from their kitchen which is a smart move.

Since the restaurant is very close to the water, they has a fresh seafood that you can choose. We got the blackened grouper, fried oyster, burger, and fish taco. They did the blacken very well with the flavor that I like. The coating of the fried oysters was very nice. The oysters are also  bigger size compared to many oyster we have eaten. \n\nThe restaurant provide a bowl of water for the dog. The only thing that they can improve on is to make the shade and umbrella a little bigger.",

The dishes I like are the Falda, Picanha, Lomo de Cerdo. Several people of my friend have tried their ribs and they like it. \n\nIf you come with a group of three, you can order the mix grill platter to share and you will have a chance for each type of meat. The Picanha is a bit salty but the marinated spice is well done into the meat. The best dish is still the Falda. \n\nThey have the lunch special now use 10 to 12 dollars. I like the full portion better. \n\nThe Chicha Morada is improving from my previous visit. The trick is telling them not to put too much ice in the cup before they pour it. The taste will be more Peruvian bean taste when they did that.",

At certain day they have all you can eat wings or tacos. \n\nThe night we have visit they have combo special 2 people for $30. Very good deal. In the combo plater, it has 5 types of grilled meat. Pork rib, petite sirloin, smoke wings, grilled chicken breast and sausage. It also come with grilled onion and wedge potatoes. This item serves over the fire grill that keep the food warm. The grille has center plate to heat up the food. I like this way because many BBQ place has combo. At the of combo, the remaining food get cold. However, the device they have in this restaurant keep warm and heat up in the middle of grill. \n\nI would give them 5 stars for the food taste, keep warm on the combo, good service, nice open dinning hall, great price on the alcohol. I got 22oz Miller lite for $5.5.",

The main reason they are good rating is they are generous on the meat quantity. \n\nThe meat selections are Rib, chicken, thin end, turkey leg, brisket, sausage and pull pork. We got the three meat combo. Although their price is the most expensive in along the I-275, but they make up the quantity of the meat. I got the brisket, sausage and rib. I think their rib is the best. I also like their brisket with good marinated BBQ sauce. I saw some one order the turkey leg sandwich, it was looking good. They will chop up the rib to bite size for easy handling. \n\nOverall my experience with them is great. Sometimes you need to wait for the meat because it is still in the smoker.",

It has successful Cinderella story that many small businesses can learn about it. \n\nMany yelper know about them for the food truck they have operated. The Arepa that they have served using the imported Venezuela cheese. This cheese is almost like mozzarella cheese. When it melt, you can pull like small string. Thousands yard long. May be not. May be you can make it to Guinness record by single pull cheese string. Good Luck:)\n\nThis is a small guy that make it to the big stage. Now they open the restaurant to serve this food. It is truest Cinderella story make it to the big stage. What make them successful is the first impact that make the customer want to comeback after one visit. The success reason are:\n1. Nice restaurant interior design to attract young and old crowd\n2. Great service that make you feel welcome\n3. Vibrant atmosphere created by the people who work there feel the Latino warm feeling \n4. Good food for the reason to come back \n\nThis was our second stop of restaurant night and we have ordered the Nico Sampler and Sopa de Res. In the sampler, every items are great especially the cachapas. The cachapas is made from sweet corn and they are good. The Sopa de Res is the beef soup and it is very good too. They told me the weekend special is their tripe soup and it usually sold out in the morning. \n\nOur waiter Rafael make our trip special and welcome. I am glad they hire the good personality and vibrant waiter. If you feel hungry at night when all restaurants have closed, they are the few open restaurant in the Bay Area. They open till 4 am in the week end. Go checkout and give them a shout if you like.",

    "text": "The line for dinner is 45 minutes wait. Fortunately they are only one block away from the Canal Street where we can wait and watch the parade. They will assign you a buzzer. And the buzzer range is about 1 block. \n\nThis restaurant is recommended by our taxi driver. He has indicated the local love this place. Tonight we have order Crawfish \u00e9touff\u00e9e and Seafood combo. The seafood combo is the fried shrimp, catfish and oyster. The coating is Louisiana bread coating with dry coat. The cat fish and the oyster is killer in this dish. The cat fish is fresh that do not smell fishy. The fish is soft and tender. The oyster in New Orleans is different and soft after fried. The chef did a very good job. Normal fried oyster is a bit rubbery but the chef here make it almost like raw oyster soft. \n\nThe pre-meal items came with the broil potatoes. The potatoes are inch in diameter. They broiled and coated with spicy salt spice that I could not guess what spice. It is good. The crawfish came with salad with sweet vinaigrette dressing. A bit sweet for me but is good. \n\nThe Crawfish \u00e9touff\u00e9e is one of the New Orleans must try item other than Gumbo and Jambalaya. This is a gumbo soup base material with rice and crawfish. This crawfish is broil alive and the shell is removed. The crawfish then added to the soup base with rice. The dish has more than 30 crawfish tail. This is a good dish.",

The tail is braised till the meat fall off the bone. The jerk chicken is marinated till enter the meat. Then it grilled to perfection. When you use your finger to eat the chicken, you still can smell the marinated sauce at your finger after you have finished the chicken. Each dish come with rice, stir fry veggies. \n\nI also got their conch soup. It is a bit fishy but it is good. Love all the food here. Portion is big to feed the hungry person.

Definitely have a good time here. Service was excellent. And thanks to Chad Bash to allow us enter the reserved room earlier before our set time. Their special room can can seat 50 people easily and good for smaller wedding party too. \n\nTonight I try their different cocktail. Each one has their unique taste. My first one is the salted caramel martini, it is sweet with foam above. Second is the tall and sexy, definitely this tall glass attractive with beautiful waist look glass. If you are thirsty, this is the drink to go. The next is the Bourbon Barrel Aged Spice Sangria, this special make sangria which is great for accompanying the meat dish. The next is I believe scofflaw but not sure. The last is the Midnight Martini to wake me up with coffee drinks. It has good coffee in it. My friend enjoy the Black Widow and the Sacred Margarita. They even pull out a virgin Black Widow for a non alcohol soft drink. It was good for them. The margarita was the best among my friends because it come with fruit press for the drinks before pour. Unique. Some of my friends order the virgin pina colada and Daiquiri. They enjoy it. \n\nOverall the good are great love the appetizers and main dish.",

Very nice clean bathroom. \n\nTonight we order three small plate. The escargot, the sear blue fin tuna, and the mussel. The escargot is seat on the bread and pour in wine sauce. It make it perfect when they are soak. The escargot is in good size and they about 10 pieces. Sauce is about the right touch for the escargot. The mussel come with creamy sauce. It is a good dish to pickup not over power the material. \n\nI like the tuna the best. This a blue fin tuna in belly section. It is a bit fatter and rich in taste. They are likely seared top with a bit soy sauce with fragrant  taste and lay over a special chili sauce. \n\nThe price for the small plate is good. The price of the large plate in about the medium to high side. Not much of seating area but good enough for the night.",

The bar has a nice decoration hanging on a T cross beam. I know the owner did not mean it to be sacred flowers on the cross but I think is perfect. \n\nI start with their signature cocktails. The black widow. It is a silver tequila, agave nectar, blackberry, lime juice and a leave of fresh basil. It do have enough alcohol for the tequila. The blackberry accompanied well. It is a good drink. \n\nThe entree is the Hawaii Delmonico. It is angus ribeye marinated in the pineapple and sweet soy. It is Hawaiian thing. I ask the steak to be medium rare. I was hoping they glaze without over burn because it is sweet. The chef did a good job not just prepared to the order, it caramelized the entire steak. It is great to have it. \n\nMy night is perfect. The bar service is very attentive. I like pre-meal item. The bread with chili bell oil sauce is well balanced.

The new restaurant do bring a lot good to the neighborhood especially for blue collar workers. If you need a good box food, I recommend this is the place. For me, I prefer to eat there because they just prepare fresh. \n\nWe started with the pork spring roll and chicken egg roll. These rolls are the complimentary from the restaurant. We added the charshu Bao. The spring and egg roll is freshly fried. Very good. The Bao has good steam bun. The price come with three Bao which has a lot of meat. Love the Bao and sauce on it. \n\nWe got the bulgogi and grilled pork noodle bowl. The bulgogi is the best. The steak of the bulgogi is soft and tender. Good to bite. The grilled pork has good seasoning. It is a bit different then most Vietnamese food but I like this way. \n\nI like restaurants set the food in right price. This restaurant make it to the list.

I feel their steak do not worth for the upgrade unless I can order the medium rare steak and chop up. Steak is over done. However I have to tip my hat to the teriyaki chicken and spicy tuna.

The cost is low, the food is great, and we even get Chef Treatment. Tonight dinner is one that closer to my heart. The restaurant or the institute is naming as Tutored Chef and they only serves dinner on Thursday and Friday night from 6 pm to 8 pm. Please call 813-393-5395 for reservation.\n\nThe menu has ten items to select. Each item not more than $6.95. You also can try their special combination of the ten items from the menu with three to five course meals. The three courses is $13.95, four courses is $15.95, and five courses is $17.95. This is a steal and price buzzer. They are currently serving the spring menu. The summer menu will be start at July. I would encourage the patron go to support them. However, if you want to get the best cooking skill, come after four to six week later when they are familiar with their menu. That is when the food is goooooood. The food and the tip are going to the school. You can tip extra with cash and mention it is for the people who serve you. It is good for the student who serves you. \n\nTonight we have everything in the menu. The restaurant starts with crouton with herb dip and enhance flavor butter. Then follow by baked empanada with passion fruit and Cajun Spice for opening. We started with grilled asparagus in asparagus puree and bacon bit. This is a well presented dish and it is elegantly presented. The asparagus is well cook and go well with the Canadian type bacon. The second initial entr\u00e9e is the Egg - it is soft broil fried egg serve over the Mushroom Ragout. When the egg is cut, the egg yolk is spilled over the mushroom. The mushroom is cook with wine sauce. When it mixed with the egg yolk, it has added the flavor. The egg is fried with crust and tasty to eat. The third initial dish is the soup du Jour. The soup is one of the student creations. Creamy soup is served with smoke bacon. \n\nThe main dish starts with the lamb - Chilled Grilled Leg of Lamb serve over the Israeli Couscous. It also has the touch of the Chimichurri sauce that makes the grilled lamb more desirable. The second main dish is shrimp - The shrimp is cook with Tarragon Tomato Relish and Chive Oil. It serves over the risotto. The taste is like old bay seasoning for the Maryland Crab. It goes well with the risotto. The third main dish is pork - They are two type pork is served here. Braise Smoked Pork Shanks and Saut\u00e9ed Pork Tenderloin.  These are two different type of preparation. And both are good. It also serves with Potato Gratin, Baby Carrot, and snow peas. It is a balance meal. The fourth main dish is the beef - Slice Grilled Beef is place on top of the crouton and place on top of sweet Onion Marmalade. The onion is saut\u00e9ed to soft and good for the mixed with the beef.\n\nWe close the night with Blueberry financier on blueberry sorbet and blueberry compote. It is pretty muffin cake over blue berry ice cream and syrup. We also have the Chocolate Marquis top with Ice Cream and roasted pistachios. Chocolate is same as mousse. \n\nI was going to post this review for my 200 hundred reviews. But restaurant this good needs to be shared. I am thinking do a UYE on the end of July or begin of the august when the student chefs get familiar with the summer menu.",

They do have outdoor seating area if you bring the pet. \n\nThere is must try drink in restaurant. The horchata iced coffee is a must have. I like it for cooling summer hot day. We got two different flans. The salted caramel and the butterscotch flan. Both flans are delicious. We also got the Timba with guava dipping. The Timba is the fried cheese - Queso Blanco. This fried cheese and great to have. \n\nThe restaurant have many sandwiches. We were here after lunch for dessert. Food ordering was easy.",

The porky is the vanilla ice cream with bacon. The ice cream is great. The bacon is good. The banana pudding is the one I like among the two. \n\nThey do have taste try.

You can have white, wheat, gluten free or Keto friendly crust. I am going for the wheat dough. The guy who made it very skill. He stretched and throws to the air spinning with further stretching to thin crust. It is a show. \n\nThen you chose your sauce. You don't need to choose one sauce. I got the extra virgin olive oil then ask them to add the basil pesto. This is the first time I see pizza using basil pesto sauce. Unique. Next step is type of cheese. I am going to mozzarellas. Then the veggies, I pick the mushroom, sundry tomatoes, minced garlic, basil leaves, jalape\u00f1o and olive. First time also I see pizza add garlic. Then the meat. I got the sausage, pepperoni, meat ball, salami. That complete my master piece. \n\nI also ask them to top with balsamic drizzle. Love it. I don't eat a lot of pizza. But I would recommend this pizza. You can add the combo with drink and chip of gelato or salad.",

We were attract to the recent post in the talk by Nick S. for the highly decorate 5 star restaurant. We have to check this out tonight. The whole street is dark at that area except this restaurant. People line out at this place before their turn to order. The store front is small and we have a suspicious this is good?\n\nThe restaurant look like a hipster place. The setup is efficient  allow the patron to order and they give you a code to pick up the food. The sitting area is limited. They have some table at the outside of the building. Today we have the Austinite taco, west coast taco, and the Texas flood taco. This is translated as Carne Asada Beef, grilled shrimp, and beef brisket. All meat is grilled to perfection. The Austinite came with caramelized onion and avocado. The Texas Flood has the chipotle BBQ sauce. The meat is grilled and have a lot flavor. The beef and shrimp is marinated. \n\nAll taco is $4.25, the burrito is $9.50, wet buritto is $10.25 and bowl is $9.25. You can order each combination at above package. The salsa of the chip is great. This place is affordable for the price, good quality food, perfect seasoning and flavor. As a result I have give them 5 star for the so little price we pay. The biggest price is to pay the gas to get there.",

We have order the lengua, tripa, asada, al pastor. I love the lengua and tripa. They are good flavor. The steak (Asada) was well seasoning, I like their way burn the steak a bit to bring out the aroma of the steak. The pastor has deep seasoning. Most of the taco place only lightly seasoning not bring out the good of the taco. Here did a good job. \n\nOn my next return, I will surely try the Cabeza, chorizo, chicharon, and carnitas. Food is reasonable price. You can call the number to place your order ahead and pickup without waiting. They are fluent in English. Since it is affordable, I am not paid your taco.",

The new owner creates the attractive menu. What you need to ask is their special. They do have separate chef special seafood items of the night other than the menu. I also like the bigger dining room with compare to old restaurants. The ventilation also improved from old setup. \n\nWe start the night with the fried calamari. The coating has a special flavor with seasoning. The dipping marinara sauce is fresh and different. I love it. Ingredients must be good condition to have the good sauce. \n\nMy wife have the chicken parmigiana with spaghettini with pink sauce. The chicken is breaded with marinated coating. It was crispy and tasty with cheese and marinara sauce. The pink sauce also interesting. My dish is a signature of the restaurant. I have the sacchettini with added grilled shrimp. This is the first time I try sacchettini. It is dumping stuff with pear and mozzarella. Then it cook in Gorgonzola Sauce. It is heavenly good. Highly recommend this dish if you have never have this Italian dish before. \n\nOverall the service and food is good. A VERY excellent Italian Restaurant. Please ask if you can bring your own wine.",

In this plaza, they are the only restaurant. Which mean perfect for parking spot since no other restaurant compete for car parking during the night. I can easily find a space to park in compare to many other restaurant which I have circular the area for parking. \n\nThe place in trendy. I like the modern decoration. \n\nService: the waitress know how to compliment the dress or shoes of the customers make lady customers feel they did the right thing. This added pleasures does go a long way. \n\nQC: I have observed the kitchen head chef QC every dish come out. This make the consistency of the food. I would said that is a big step to make sure the food come out correctly. \n\nKitchen: the new Noble Crust does have full equip big kitchen. It make all the food fly out without too much to wait. This is the reason why they are successful in this location. \n\nFood: we have the bistro steak, FGBLT, and the PEI mussel. The steak is cook to the temperature we have asked. It is good size of steak. It top over collars green with southern twist. The accompanying mash potato top with drizzle balsamic vinegar and green aioli. I like the steak top with green apple chimichuri. Very unique. The FGBLT is lay the fried green tomato as a base and layer with pimento cheese. Final touch top with glazed pork belly. The presentation is very nice. However the pork belly harmony is not there. I would said they need to work on the skin fat and meat combination. It need to be melt at your tongue instead a very chewy piece. I like the PEI mussel. It is cook with saffron broth. Most of the mussel I have either butter wine sauce or tomato red sauce. I like the way they have it with the southern twist with added andouille sausage. \n\nOverall, they are very good job with competitive price. It make me to revisit. Truly 5 stars restaurant with the right price. Not perfect. But close enough.",

After visited the restaurant, I found out the reason why. 50% of the food is fried here, it will be not great to have the take out. Eat there is the key. Because when you brought the food home, these food turn tougher. Especially the pork. \n\nWe started out appetizers as Salty Fish Pate. The pastry skin is very flaky and the salty fish is great. Our next appetizer is the Akra. This is malanga fritter with great coating with nice seasoning. Malanga is root veggies. It is interesting to be fried with coating. \n\nWe order the griot. It similar to chicharon in Spanish food. But the pork is seasoning before fried. Better than chicharon. It come with rice and bean and tostone. It also serve with spicy coleslaw and spicy red curry. This dish really need to be eat there. If not, the pork skin will be to tough to bite after you order to go and eat at home. You need to experience the crispy of just fried pork. \n\nI also got the Tassot Kabrit. It is marinated fried goat. The bone in chop meat is delicious and soft. It was not tough. May be just fry or the chef have good technique. \n\nOverall we like our food. A lot people order take out. Tip don't wear good clothes. Because you smell like fried food after eating. They need to improve the ventilation system.",

Many crystal chandelier hang from ceilings. That is the reason they call this place Crystal Dining Room. \n\nOne thing is they lack of service people die to lack of customer. However, food is good in compare to many place and the price is good for the food and ambience. I would host the wedding reception here. \n\nWe have the New York Strip au Poivre. The steak is big enough and the sauce is great. The accompanying potatoes and asparagus was great. We also has the grilled salmon bed with rice, top with mango salsa. All the dish is great. The chef has great skill. All entree come with salad. I also like their dark n stormy cocktails.",

Eat while you can before the weather turn too cold. \n\nJeremiah's Italian Ice has many varieties. Their trademark ice is scoop froggy frog. However I like the mango and sea salt caramel. Like other Italian ice place in some Tampa a layer Italian ice with a layer of soft serve. Jeremiah can pile 4 layers which a layer more than anyone can pile in Tampa. I have try that route. \n\nI also have them do the ice only. The ice girl pile 4 layer and top one scoop of four favorite on top of four layer you have ask. It look colorful. The trick is to eat eat fast since they don't have soft serve in between. If it melt, the ice will mix together. But I like this way even freezing my brain. I have a few of them when I try this way. Take boon challenge!!!!!",

This store hold it own with very competitive pricing. \n\nThe love of the store is not about the groceries. It is about the deli section. The have all kind of sandwiches to select include the one I like now grilled sea bass sandwich. It is only $6.99 for regular size sandwich. Compare to the seafood restaurant next door, I pick the value, good food anytime in this store. Other sandwiches include Cuban, gyro, Italian, ropa veja and more. Come to check them out. \n\nThe have the hot deli in Cuban cuisine series. It include the roast pork and devil crab. Food here is good and convenient to housewife.

The use of volcanic rock stone heat up over 700 degree and grilled the food is a healthy way of cooking. In Taiwan, the meat is marinated and cook over the stone. It is not much of difference than this restaurant. \n\nThe lunch of the restaurant offer a better deal in smaller portions for experience if you don't want to spend too much money. For $12 you can have the sirloin, shrimp or ahi Tuna with a side during lunch. Recently they run the special for $18include steak and shrimp. \n\nThey have butter on the side if you want to grilled your meat with it. This type of cooking requires fresh seafood of premium grade of steak. It is not recommend for pork or chicken. \n\nThe food is tasty. It may require some minimum cooking skill to enjoy it. So who can blame if the food did not cook well. It was great to see the method is introduced in US. The dinner item is medium range in price compare to any steak restaurant.",

The shrimp size is big also the spicy tuna is good size. We are happy the quantity they allow to add on. There are plenty selection. I got the masago, seaweed salad, fried corn and more. The add on is great. The base selection also a lot. I got the white rice and soba noodle. \n\nOne thing that can be improved is the their rice. Instead of white rice, sushi rice is better. It has more flavor when preparing correctly. Other than the add on, they also have large variety of sauce for selection. If you don't like to mixed your on bowl, you can get the premixed bowl.",

The waffle is puffy and crispy. Right baking. It come with two scoop of ice cream and two topping. I have the mango and coconut ice cream with assorted mochi and the blue berry mochi. Delicious. \n\nAdvice for the new comer. Come early at dinner before they are busy, get all the order in earlier. For the owner, I think open late and closing late is better. Breakfast usually don't get much sale. Usually people get one item and leave. Dinner people tendency to order more and get more sale. I will update on next visit.",

They have bar with TV for the single dinner or people who wait for the table. Atmosphere is great.\n\nWe have started with the Beef Carpaccio. The thin slice of the beef to be pick up and set on the white truffle and a touch of balsamic vinegar. This is delicious. Our entr\u00e9e are Blacken Atlantic Salmon and Crispy Duck. The salmon serves with spinach and zucchini. I like the lemon butter sauce that accompany the vege. the salmon grill with blacken at top of the salmon that make the taste desirable. Some improvement can be made on how to prepare the blacken side. Like the beef can be cooked for well-medium-rare, the blacken also can be prepared lite spicy-medium-black spicy. This can give the customer a choice of their familiar taste. The crispy duck is definite the go to dish. The duck is debone to only three bone left -wing, two leg bone. This make the dinner easy to consume. The dish serves with mash potato and the duck top with the gravy. The skin is very crispy that make the name of the dish. The duck meat is great and softly prepare. I have try crispy duck with orange sweet sauce, five spice crispy duck, pekin duck. But duck with gravy is first time. We end our evening with champagne raspberry sorbetto. The sorbet is great. By pulling the champagne on top of the sorbet that create the bubble sensation of the taste. The dinner end with creative dessert is making the dinning perfect.\n\nToday we came before 7 PM and they have the entr\u00e9e for the half price. It is a steal. Even after 7 PM, they are also good due to the amount of the food was given. The quality and quantity surely make the chart. The service is perfect for the night. Certainly will be back. They deserve the five star rating for tonight. The half pricing make it to the top.",

I have seen many chef has over cook the mussel but the here is very good touch. \n\nThe entr\u00e9e are 6 oz sirloin and the shrimp and scallops linguine alla vodka. This sirloin was well prepared to the temperature I have ordered. The seafood linguine was well prepared. I like the large shrimp and large sea scallops. Good selection on the material. The dish make excellent mark.",

Some day includes salsa and swing dancing if you want shake off you hip. \n\nThe food we order have some Peruvian and some Columbian cuisine.

Shrimp is cocktail size. \n\nOur entr\u00e9e are Bandeja Paisa Colombiana. This dish has many items. It includes grilled steak, fried Pork Belly, sausage, fried egg, rice, fried beam, fried sweet plantain. It is parade of food. Great taste for each items. Our second dish is Pescado A Lo Macho - fried filet fish as a base and with saut\u00e9ed shrimp, octopus, squid, and mussel in seafood broth tomato base sauce. I like the sophisticated cooking. It make it interesting. \n\nThey have army of wait staff. Easy to get attention. Their staff can speak clear English which make easy to order. Food is good, service is good, great experience.",

It is cute store at central avenue. \n\nThey serve poke that you can do your own or you can get one that pre set for you. We go for their best seller pre set - Mixology Poke. This is salmon and Tuna as protein. Including the seaweed and ginger. I like they add extra sauce on the side if you needed. Also extra salsa. The fish is firm and the piece was cut big. They were generous on the protein to create happy customers. Good strategy. Now day we have so many poke place open. This will be good sign for better and more protein. \n\nThe store clerk was very friendly. Definitely will visit them on next time I am in the neighborhood. Enough poke to fill the stomach. I will try their boba next time.",

This restaurant has been in the Bay Area for a year and I saw Anna M. has carry out from this sushi restaurant to watch the movie at home. We decided to try her cinema sushi bite. \n\nThis is actually mixed of Korean and Japanese sushi restaurant. Our lunch special is perfect here. We have ordered the Kahlbee lunch box. It came with 4 pieces of California rolls, 3 pieces of sushi (tuna, salmon, and white fish), vegetables tempura, white rice and the main item Kahlbee - the Korean BBQ with short rib. I have been eating many lunch box special with California roll. This one has some Masago (fish egg) on top and makes it nicer. The Korean BBQ is grilled to perfect. The meat is tenderized and they not over grill to charcoal. Perfect meat seasoning. \n\nWe also order the lunch special for additional two rolls with total less than $10. The spicy crunchy tuna and Unakyu Roll (eel roll in eel sauce). I prefer the seaweed to be wrapped outside than inside. The reason is the roll receives crunchy seaweed on the outside than soak and wet to be wrapped inside. The crunch tuna is delicious. They make good use of tiny pieces of tempura chips. Some use the crunchy noodle but I like this restaurant use the tempura chip is more authentic. \n\nThe service is good. The restaurant did give us a special with 3 small Korean appetizers - Kimchi, fish cake, and egg cake. I love them all especially the fish cake. I would recommend for the lunch special and you can try variety of food with affordable price. I also like the combination of Korean food and sushi.",

I have been to this restaurant 5 year ago and it does not give me an impression of good Vietnamese cuisine. \n\nI have read many of my friend review about the pho, it is not the best. Why we revisit. I saw Joel review on the vegan food and decide to try it again. After I have read their menu, we discover the dishes that not normally serve in Pinellas Park Vietnamese hub. You need to navigate to their house special. Tonight we have a dish that we have try in Hanoi and did not see anyone doing it. The chargrilled fish. It is the grill fish \"Thang Long\" style. The fish is marinated with turmeric and baby dill. This dish we found at the street of old town Hanoi. Now we know they have it. \n\nWe also order the autumn roll with fresh roll on grill ground pork. Interesting. We order the the authentic happy pancake with large rice crepe with pork, shrimp and bean sprout. It is very unique. The other dish include traditional Central Vietnam Rice Noodle. This is special noodle of the central Vietnam. That how it got the name. \n\nOverall they are good. I would suggest if you are here, don't try the pho for once. But try their house special menu.",

This is goat with creole sauce. The goat is a bit smelly which mean the process do not include like soak in the milk to soften the smell. But the dish is still good. The second dish is the griot -- it is fried pork. This is popular item of the list. They have good fried systems. All dish come with rice and fried plantain. The rice have a choice of white rice and bean, mixed rice and bean or black rice. I would recommend the black rice. The black rice is actually their specialty. It is a mushroom rice. Very delicious. \n\nYou need to be a little patient to come to this place. Because they cook all food right there. So it requires 15 minutes wait minimum from order.",

I like the Tanger sauce they have put over the rice. The use of spice is very similar. It is definitely a recommended restaurant to visit. The few things that I would comment on the restaurant. 1. Employees should use mask during pandemic. 2. Serve real plate instead of styrofoam box for the food if customers dine in. Other than that, they are great restaurant and good service to the local. \n\nWe order two plate from chef special. The first dish is the Le Carnivore. This is the grilled skew steak and chicken. The steak was process and good tender. The chicken has the marinated spice into the meat. The hummus is like soft like the silk. They must take time grind and prepare this hummus. The Morocco shlada or \"salad\" is well prepared. Love it. Our second dish is the mermaid. This is grilled salmon and skew shrimp. This seafood combo dish. The shrimp is large and the fish is good. \n\nOur appetizer is one of the best falafel. The coating is fried to crispy. The inside is still green. Similar to the falafel in Morocco. The spice in falafel is very flavorful. Don't forget to order this appetizer.",

This restaurant do not specific has one but able to manage the reservation and scheduling. Does mean they don't have one but integrated the system in the waitress. They also don't need one floor manager which is effective. Not second hand sit around worker. Very efficient. Big applause to the restaurant with good business model. \n\nThe food. Mmmmm good. Very good and reasonable pricing. We have order the Szechwan Cracked Peppercorn and Garlic Steak and the Shrimp Lo Mein. The shrimp Lo Mein is good but the steak is better. The steak is NY Strip with their spice rub and finished on the grill. Then it the sauce with pan fry garlic is added on the steak. Well balance on the taste. Steak is cooked to your order. \n\nThe service is well train on the table side manner waitress. Pay attention to the detail of how to serve. Am I coming back- a big yes.

No take a back step to naturalize to American taste. It is India street food and it suppose to be like it was done in India. Only one level of spiciness. If you cannot take it, do not come here. This is not your typical American Indian food. It is real to the conditions which cook in India. \n\nWith that said. I love the authenticity of the food. It is good spice. Marinated deep to the bone. We start with pani puri. It has shell crust outwardly and inwardly fill with cilantro, onion and tomato. This dish comes with the secret liquid to be pour into the opening of the crust. Then you enjoy the whole thing. It is out of body experience. I have the Apollo Fish. It is spicy and good. We also has the peppers chicken. It is very interesting to try it. \n\nTheir menu is extensive. Go find out yourself. The vegetarian side is amazing too. At lunch, they have this Tali plate that is intriguing.

To open it, find the point of crust tip and hit it the ground to crack it open slightly. Than you can peel break it. Or use screw driver penetrate to the tip and pry it open. \n\nSome said this fruit look like the poop and some said is a golden nuggets. This fruit is either you like it or stay away of it.

The sweetness is one of the kind that you cannot imagine. \n\nIf you have durian at home, the people who visited your home will know that since the aroma of the smell will occupy the air space of your home. When the gardener or planter walk under the durian tree, they need to wear a helmet. The ripe durian actually fall to ground and that is the signed ready to eat. You don't pick durian from the tree.

Please be aware of the temperature since it is close to Mississippi River and will catch a lot of wind drift in cold weather. The restroom is pack with tourist during the Mardi Gras season. I would advise you to take the restroom at old US Mint. When they are open, they have the cleaner restroom for the ladies. It is just across the street at the end of market. No line!!!!! \n\nThe vendor of art varies from many things. It ranges from clothing to front car display plate. During Mardi Gras season, the venders also located open sky concrete pad area. There are fantastic hand craft.\n\nPlease try their street food like fried cone or roast cone. These may be a must try item and they located at Mother Nature's Cupboard. Some of the venders sell crepe on the order, oyster and crawfish. Looking for special artist item such as one of the artists can bend the wire in different color to make a ring that can fit your exact ring finger size.

The wait for dinner is 1 hour average. They don't take reservation. The best way to get to the restaurant is during their opening and during parade. We have found a trick to get to this restaurant. YELP has indicated the restaurant open at 11:00 am, they are actually open at 10:30. I am using this advantage to beat the crowd by 10 minutes to get a seat.    \n\nToday lunch we have ordered the chargrilled oysters, fried crab craw, fried crawfish tail. The chargrilled oysters are season with garlic and salted and cook over the open flame. After you have eaten the oyster, you can dip the bread into the half shell to pick up the remaining seasoning sauce on the shell. Mmmm it is very good. The oysters here are better than the one we have in Florida. They are fresh and big. Somehow the swamp water breeds a better oyster. The fried crawfish tail is great to go with the beer. The fried blue crab craws are much better in this case. It is heavenly good. We were joking may be order to go order and sell with double price for the people who are waiting hour in line. \n\nSince they are open for lunch at 10:30 am, it is consider brunch. You actually can skip the breakfast at Cafe du Monde and come here for better food experience. I have pick this restaurant to be one of the best in New Orleans to close my double digit review.",

    "text": "Rare Ethnic Food 43. Caribbean Smoke Jerk Cuisine. \n\nUsually you will see Jerk BBQ chicken. The chicken mostly grilled. This one has a twist with Caribbean Smoke Jerk Chicken. The chicken is marinated with the special house sauce. The marinated is to the bone. It was greatly prepared. As a result, when they are out of food, they close for the remaining day. They also has Smoke Jerk Pork. Both items are very delicious. I like the chicken wing a lot. I would said you got to eat there. Because, when they just take out from the Smoker, the skin is still crispy. That why you need to eat at the table or in your car. DELICIOUS. Now with that said. Some time by luck, you can have their specialty rack of lamb. My goodness, those are amazing. Check out my picture. \n\nDon't get disappointed if they close because they run out. I have actually try visiting this place three times before I actually got to try their food.",

If the service can have the smilies face to customers, probably 5 solid stars. \n\nThis is a food truck in front of the plaza parking lot. I like they take an effort to fence it and decorated with plant and straw like umbrellas. It is good effort. We got Hawaiian Rainbows with passion fruit ice cream. It is definitely good for the picture. The shave ice was pile on the cup. The best thing is the color fruit flavors syrup was pull to bottom of the cup. Some other place they don't give enough syrup and the bottom shave ice did not receive it. Not this place. \n\nThe passion fruit ice cream is unique. They have some other flavors I like to try next such as Allota Colada, Green Paradise, Onalicious.",

I am glad that Temple Terrace has established this restaurant that have this capability. This is classified as a street food. They are savory and good snacks. \n\nWe are here for snack that is close 9:00pm. They have two type fried chicken. Fried chicken fingers or chicken row. You probably understand chicken fingers. Chicken row are fried bread chicken breast and cut into pieces. This is my favorite. The breaded coating is not normal flour. It is crispy and the Chinese spice is in it. They are very good taste. \n\nThey also have curry items. But I am interesting on their pig feet, cool tilapia, and the Szechuan Sweet pork rib. I may have to come back to try it. \n\nI am excited to their price also. $3.89 for one whole box of chicken row. Very affordable. If you select the meal, you can ask the spring roll for the side and a soft drink come with it.",

It was split to half and grilled to perfection. I like the chicken with juicy meat. It is wonderful to eat. The side is amazing. We have dirty rice and baba ghanoush. The dirty rice has ground meat and sliced gizzards. Very interesting. \n\nThe gyro is good. Not particularly impressed. If I visit next time, I would try their grilled snapper. It look interesting.

We got the clown cone. This is with cotton candy. We take a part and eat those separately. \n\nBy the way, extra scoop is only a dollar more. The clown cone is $7 and extra scoop make it to the $8.

Byblos has these technique in high standard. I have the lamb chop and my wife has a mixed grilled. The lamb is the bone in lamb that is well cut and perfectly grilled. The marinated spice is well deep into the meat. This dish is my favorite. My wife have the mixed grilled. They are good also. But after you have the lamb, you will feel the lamb is more superior than the sheik kabab. \n\nThe room is well decorated. Each room has it own character.

This is the best of the cold app. It come green mango salad, aji amarillo sorbet, fish sauce caramel and tamarind peanut crunch. It creative that the sorbet replace the wasabi and the fish sauce caramel replace the balsamic reduction sauce. Now you know why they call themselves food lab. \n\nThe second course are the hot appetizers. I have smoked maple glazed pork belly. It top with hoe cake, black eyed peas, green tomato chow-chow. Usually I don't care about hoe cake but sauce and other ingredients combine, it is great. The pork belly is cook perfectly. If you are not good chef, do not try this dish because it need three part meat harmony. My wife has Serrano ham zeppole. The slice hams were place on top of rosemary doughnuts with compressed melon, Saba and Parmesan snow. Interesting dish. The rosemary was deep fried to crispy with seasoning. I have not have it this way before. \n\nOur third course are the main dishes. I have the red snapper a la plancha. It is fillets snapper with saut\u00e9ed and glazed on top on avocado coconut grits, baby spinach, mergers marmalade, avocado chutney and mango harissa pur\u00e9e. This best main dish tonight the pur\u00e9e go very well with the fish. My wife has the painted hills short rib 'sancocho'. Usually the Caribbean sancocho is a mix of meat and veggies soup. This is an overhaul design for the short rib with boniato, yuca, sweet potato, and sweet corn, green plantain,avocado toss watercress, and cilantro sweet garlic juice. I only can said - it is good. \n\nThe final course is the sugar crusted butter cake or chocolate peanut butter bar. Both of them is great. I the butter cake because the cake form the caramelized sugar crust on all expose wall. The cake is syrup and is good. \n\nThe only thing is the food take a bit time to come out for the first dish. The rest are good. The service is great. The drink you have to refer to the pic since we don't know what they have created.",

    "text": "This restaurant locate at downtown St. Pete close to the museum of fine art. Since this is a Thursday night with museum special deal after 5 pm ($5 per adult, normal $17), after museum, we decide to come to this restaurant. \n\nThe store front is a open bar. The time we were there is about six and they can sit you immediately. After 30 minutes, there is already a waiting line. Please come before six if you don't want to wait for sit. Bella already extend their sitting area with capacity, however if you are late, you will need to wait.  Among all the restaurant at downtown, they are the most reason in price for the food. \n\nToday I order the menu with \"secondi\" category - marinated skirt steak and my wife order the grilled chicken pasta. The item in the \"secondi\" came with soup of the day or salad. This is better deal. The $22 skirt steak came with two side and a soup. Good deal. The soup of the day is minestrone sausage soup. It is bean base, dice tomatoes, dice carrot, and chop pasta in crush tomatoes base. I believe they have added the oregano and basil to enhance the flavor. It make the soup well balance and interesting. \n\nThe skirt steak is marinated with sweet sauce and serve with mash potatoes and grill broccolini. The broccolini is very impress. They broil, grill and stir fry in the process with garlic sauce with a hint of spicy chili. This make the food sophisticate. The skirt steak is grill to your order and slice to the bite size. \n\nThe whole proceed of serving is ok. It is slow in the beginning but it pick up at the end. The extend area may be good for company Christmas party. It deserve for full stars due to to chef cooking skill, service, clean bath room and good pricing.",

    "text": "Agree with Mark for the tasty food and fast service. I think it is more like 4.5 stars restaurant then actual 5 stars. I wonder why they have to be located at Soho area, why don't they locate near USF area to attract more students and the Busch Garden tourist. Soho already has so many restaurants, I think their pricing is good for the students. \n\nI will start with their side selection. They have several selection I like. The roasted vegetables, braised white bean and Greek salad is good. For the Greek salad selection is free with kabab. Other combinations need to add $1.69. Tonight we have the steak and salmon kabab. Both of them is flavorful. The steak is in sweet marinated sauce. The reason they get half stars less due to the meat quality,  it is chewy. The salmon was perfect. It come with zucchini in the skew and the salmon juice dip into the zucchini and make it more sophisticated. \n\nThe price is right. I like they use the actual silver ware instead of plastic ware. The place is typical fast food. Definitely will be back.",

    "text": "The super bowl night and we decide to sit at the bar side of the Bonefish Grilled.  The new added menu for the Bar Bites Menu has added another dimension for the order. The items start at $4 to $12. The bar bites menu have 8 selection and some of the selection have two different type of meat. The appetizer has 11 items to select. The combination of the bar menu and the appetizer create over twenty different selection. This is good business model with Tapas mentality that the bonefish management has provided the customer with more choice. It definite makes the top bar in this area. It will attract more customer in the future.\n\nTonight we started with the Lamb Lollipop hops. I have this dish at different Bonefish location and I want to make sure different chef can create this dish better. The lamb chop turns up better at this location. The meat is cook to perfect medium and have hint of salt to make the chop taste better without losing it meat taste. We have order the Lobster Street Taco. My wife like this dish and said it have big chunk of lobster meat and worth the $5 item. We have order a bowl of the corn chowder with crab meat. I will advice you order the bowl instead of the cup when you are hungry or two people in the party that can share this dish. The cup and bowl size only a $1 different and you get more on the bowl. We have gone to the appetizer menu and order the Filet Satay. This is new item in the appetizer. It is a center cut filet mignon in soy seasoning and serves with spicy mustard sauce in tomatoes, cucumber, onion.  The meat is tender and soft. The only down side is each pieces is small. However they are delicious. The next appetizer is Singapore Calamari. The calamari is lightly dry pepper breaded and deep fried. It serves sweet spicy sauce. They are crispy and we have left nothing on the plate because they are insane good. The last item is the coconut shrimp with sweet spicy sauce. The dish has six jumbo shrimp and coated with coconut flake. This is a good value dish and it is less than $9. \n\nWe are stuff after all the items. I forgot to mention the Sunday night have happy hours till 6:30. The wine is $3.25 a glass and the draft beer is a dollar. Can't beat that!!! Our server is super nice and attentive. As a result, tonight we are awarding this restaurant with 5 stars.",

For the restaurant we order the chirashi. It is a rice with assorted sashimi tuna, salmon, octopus, unagi, ikura, egg, hokkigai, kanikama, white fish. Very delicious. Second dish we have is the tonkutsu ramen. This pork bone soup is nice and tasty. It has the roll pork belly. Next is my favorite with Cajun shrimp roll. The shrimp is soft shell. It is deep fried to a point the the head and tail is crispy to eat. Basically you cat the entire shrimp with shell and head. The roll is delicious with the Cajun sprinkles. \n\nIt is authentic Japanese food here with a twist.",

    "text": "Yelping No. 2000!!!\n\nRare Ethnic Food # 50. Russian and Ukrainian cuisine. \n\nThis little restaurant just opens no long ago. I already like it very much. It is one of the kind in Tampa Bay Area. You have to experience it for it wonderful cuisine. The restaurant locates near USF which make sense for many Russian students study there. The day we have visited, not many customers. It need great word of mouth to spread a good news. \n\nThe menu is simple and delicious. The display in the restaurant is nice with Russian doll. They have the bakery good next to the counter. The only thing I would complain is the chair is too tight. \n\nWhat is meaning of \"Babushka\". It mean triangular folded kerchief for head or it also mean grandmother. Many Russian doll has kerchief over it is part of long tradition. It also can mean your grandma kitchen. Take your pick. \n\nOur first dish we have order is the Borscht. This is a famous soup with meat, saut\u00e9ed veggies and beet root. The beet make the entire soup red color. The soup is great during winter. It top with the rosemary. The second dish is Blinchiki. This is a tradition wheat crepe wrap the meat inside. Very unique in many way. \n\nOur third dish is the Russian dumplings. They have three different fillings inside the dumplings. The Lamb, Beef and Pork. We mixed the pork and beef with the soup base. I like the most is the pork. I would suggest order with soup options. The fourth dish is the Syrniki. This is a pancake made from cheese and wrap with meat options. I like this one too. \n\nOur fifth and final dish is the Kotlety. It is three minced meat croquettes with a side. We have chose Russian brown rice\n\nOverall our experience have exceed our expectations. It was marvelous meal we have at the dinner. It deserves a 5 stars attention. I would said you may need to change your taste bud when you come to this place. Many items is less sodium. But the taste still there. Russian like to use the sour cream. But I don't.",

Since it is at the capital, the cuisine includes many area of China due to dynasty dining. \n\nI like many items in the menu and the special of the day. It has an attractive menu.

The beef is marinated and braised for some time. \n\nWe also got the fish with black bean sauce. This black bean sauce with chili is a nice combination. The fish is fried with whole fish no head. So you need to skill eater to order this dish. Our last entree is the Dong Po Pork. I love this dish when they prepared correctly. This is Pork belly with skin and braised in sweet sauce. It need to be braised over time to soften the tough skin and meat. Which they have done that. I would recommend this dish if you come to visit. \n\nWe order the beef pie from the special menu. It is special street food category. If they carry this dish. Order the pork pie. Overall experience is excellent. Enjoy the good cooking. We have been back twice.",

They do put the sauce over base then on top of mixed in ingredients. This area they can improve. \n\nWe also got the combination pho and grilled pork bun. Their Vietnamese side food also delicious.

The fish is delicious with bone. The other dish we have is the  dolce ribeye steak. This dish we select the rice. I like the spice up rice. The steak was well marinated. It is tasty to the bone. \n\nThe restaurant has a yellow bird. It sing for us while we are eating. The chai tea is complimentary. The soup was special complimentary.

    "text": "This is brand new Brazilian Steakhouse. It is a chain restaurant with well train staff to get this restaurant run smoothly at the first month. The lunch is cheaper than the dinner. The all you can eat steak also includes all you can eat buffet for other miscellaneous items. \n\nThe steak is awesome. Especially I like the lamb chop, chicken heart, skirt steak, top sirloin. All steak is well seasoning. Especially the chicken heart and chicken drum stick. The chicken drum stick is marinated in wine sauce. Very delicious. There are wave and wave of meat to cut. They also bring out big giant leg of lamb. \n\nDuring this time on the brand new opening, they have 10% off the bill. On the buffet table, they have heart of palm, Smoke salmon, caramel mushrooms and more. \n\nTip - don't forget to ask for the steak sauce such chimichuri, hot sauce, mint jelly to go with steak and lamb chop. \n\nService is excellent. These include the speed, attention to detail, clean up, and frequently check on the table. Definitely 5 stars.",

    "text": "Rare Authentic Food #38 - Florida own seasoning crab. \n\nI am surprised Nick and Tina did not smell this one out since both of them love crab. This restaurant now is my number one store to go finger food for crab. It is king of the crab store. Best ever. If you want some finger food during this football season, this will be the one if you don't mind to get down dirty with finger for limited crab meat. \n\nToday I got two types of crab. The garlic crab and fried crab. Both of them are excellently exceedingly my expectations. The garlic crabs are finger licking good. 3 crab for $7.50. I also got the seasoning fried crab for $11. Man!!! Those are good. The seasoning is deeeeeeeeep into the crab since the crab is minorly crack to allow the seasoning get into the crab meat. They have other item. But I think you should concentrate on the crabs. \n\nAm I coming back. Hell yes!!!! Love the food. By the way this is just a take out store. You can order 15 minutes ahead so it won't be any wait. The crab is fresh. The fried crab is normally bigger than garlic crab. There is not sit down area. Only carry out.",

    "text": "It is about 4.5 stars. Onur is part market and part restaurant. This is a Turkish market for item like Turkish delight and all the Turkish goods such as tunas jam, coffee, spices, flour, marinated steak and more. \n\nWe got some of the cookies and milk drinks mixed and a kabab to go. We have the chicken kabab and it comes with veggies. You will not believe the kabab is good. Love the juicy chicken kabab. \n\nThe menu of the restaurant was easy to select. The price is affordable in compare to full middle eastern restaurants. The kabab was prepared in ten minutes. In compare to restaurants I usually waited for half hours. This is the plus to prepare the food quick and quality.",
