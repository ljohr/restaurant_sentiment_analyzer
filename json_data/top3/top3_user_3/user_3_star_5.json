    "text": "I would said this restaurant is unique in many ways. The cuisine, the setting of the restaurant, the attention of owner make the place great to eat. There are gluten free item and grass feed beef as their advertisements of the material of the food. \n\nI like to mention a little about their sound system. It is front row seat to the concert. The restaurant invest a very good sound system that is pleasure to the ear. They also hide their speaker very well. Imagine they play the Star Wars music. May the force be with you. \n\nWe have order the taste of the islands and the blacken mango salmon. The taste of the island include curry goat, Ox tail and jerk chicken. The goat is a bit heavy smell. The jerk chicken is great with the seasoning they have. The best is the Ox Tail. The Ox tail with Caribbean spice make this dish special.\n\nThe blacken salmon is prepare with Caribbean blacken spice. It is very nice. It serves over cook pineapple sauce. The fish is tasty. This dish accompanied with a side salad. The desert we have is the coconut cake. The coconut cake has layers of coconut cream. It is guilty pleasure. \n\nThe greeting of the owner from the restaurant make this place special. The decorations is modern and it is gear up for upper class power lunch or dinner. Nice touch. Service is great and the cook is the owner wife. It is family run with attention to the details.",

    "text": "#700 review. Rare Ethnic food 1 - Guatemalan cuisine. \n\nI choose Rincon Guatemalteco to start my 700 series in yelp review. I will start my ethnic review for next several reviews. The restaurant name meaning \"in the corner of Guatemala.\" If you like get inside of this corner, please check them out. \n\nThe food is an authentic, special flavor, fantastic prep work, and unique. I was surprised by taste. Today we order the Tostadas de Frito. This is an appetizer. It is tostadas top with black bean paste and sprinkle with dry cheese. My wife mistaken the black bean as chocolate. You can smell the heavy fermented cheese smell before you eat. \n\nThe tamale we have is wrap around chicken pieces. The tamale paste is different than many tamale. The taste is more to rice paste than the bean paste texture. \n\nWe have the main dish as Carne Adobada. It is marinated pork with rice and black bean. I would describe the best black bean paste that I have. It cook with garlic and make this bean paste stand out from other black bean preparation. \n\nThe two drink that we have are Rosa Jamaica and \nTamarind. Rosa Jamaica is the best drink in the Bay Area. I have try many place for this drink. But this one stand out.\n\nPlease call before you go. Close on Wednesday. Tuesday close early. Weekday 9am to 6 pm. Weekend 9am to 7 pm.",

    "text": "Keyword: Authentic, Northern Thai, Unique \n\nI believe the above word define this restaurant. They are the best Thai now in my book in the Bay Area. This restaurant just open less than a month but it does have all the unique food that you will not find any where. One thing I have to warn you is their food is spicy when you have the chef select the medium hot. For me I like very hot. \n\nThey serve street food that only can be found in the northern kingdom of Siam - Khao Soi. This is a unique dish that only this restaurant have it. The  dish include crispy and egg noodle with chicken in coconut milk curry. The chicken include the breast and chicken drumsticks. \n\nThey also serve Pla Koong that I like. I have this dish when I am in Miami from an authentic Thai restaurant. I have try many Thai restaurant but non have come close. Now I found my favorite again. This is broil shrimps in very spicy mixed of lemony base spices. It include lemon grass and kefir lime leave. Yum. Very spicy. Love it. \n\nWe also order the crispy duck in basil leave. The spice they use is difficult to describe. Very good dish. We order a drunken noodle. But this time the noodle is too soggy. I have this noodle at their lunch before and it is better. We also order another northern Thai  - ginger curry. It is pork shoulder in long hours braised cooking. This is a sweet dish. For the rice you can order the white rice or the sticky rice. I never thought the sticky rice go very well with curry. \n\nI hope all yelper make an extra mile to support new and unique restaurant. The menu is still evolving since they can cook many northern dishes of the Thai cuisine. This restaurant do not serve alcohol but they allow you BYOB. I brought my sake. Very convenient and saving.",

Since we have 7 in the group, we have ordered the Family Dinner. It is a whole chicken with salad, fried yuca, and cilantro rice. The salad is fresh with vinaigrette dressing. I like the cilantro rice with spice in rice. The chicken is marinated and slowly roasted with the skin is crispy outside. We have added the tostones - the flatten fried green plantain for other member to experience the food. \n\nWe also ordered the Cuenellis Special - Palomilla Steak with fried egg. The steak is well season and tasty, however, the steak may need to be tenderizing for better chewing. The dish also come with fried yuca, 1/4 chicken and fried sweet plantain. A lot food for affordable meal.",

We know about this restaurant when we were at a casual conversation with Michele D. husband. He mention to us this hidden location that serve a good similar German food.\n\nWe were here for their early bird special. The special is a good deal for this restaurant. They have seven items to choose from. It come with a choice of salad or soup. I have the Sauerbraten and my wife has the Pork - Weiner Schnitzel. I like me Sauerbraten. This is pork tenderloin in wine sauce. It come with red cabbage and the Spaetzle. The red cabbage is like pickle veggie. The Spaetzle is like starch short noodle. My appetizer is the tomato soup. A bit sour for me but it is good after add pepper and salt. \n\nThe ambient is very nice. I like it old school represent the country of the cuisine. Kuku clock, bear ceramic cup, the flag.

    "text": "This is my special review for a single vender in the French Market. The reason that they need special attention is due to the unique food that they are prepared. If you visit the French Market, do not miss up the opportunity to try their food. Their vender stand is located at the last vender stand of the food venders at first open air structure. It is very much at the middle of two open air structures. \n\nThey occupied three vender stands and a front open air stand. You will not miss it. The front vender stand offers the roast cone and broil peanut. They roasted their corn in the enclose smoker. Once they receive the order, they will peel off the skin and show the ear. Then they will dip the corn to the hot butter, and season with salt, parmesan cheese (yum), Cajun spice (wow). My wife loves this corn. The inner vender stand serves the deep fried corn, crab cake, gator bites, and frog leg. They also serve different type of fruit drink and icy. We were curious the deep fry corn did not turn to pop corn. The vender owner assures us it will not happen. Evidently, it does not and coated with thin cajun coating. I have concluded the deep fried corn is a boy food and the roast corn is girl food base on the preference.\n\nWe also order the home made crab cake. The surprise is not the crab cake; it is the side dish that comes with it. The deep fried kale. I have the deep fried kale at the Cool Bean restaurant in Tallahasse FL. I did not expect they are as good as the restaurant grade. The Kale is deep fried for 30 second then season. The best thing is when you put on the tongue and the kale melt like cotton candy. The vender did a very good job.",

    "text": "#900 Review. Rare Ethnic Food No.11\n\nSmall business with hard working people deserve to be recognized for their success. Not only for their home feel cooking but also for the very good rare items they have served.\n\nBefore we were there, we check the people who posted the review. Many people who posted has less than 2 reviews. And only 9 were posted. No elite has posted until me and my wife visit. They have been open since last November and they have not catch attention of elite Yelper. \n\nLittle Angel (Angelito) is bringing the love of food in our area. They are Puerto Rico and Latin cuisine. We have the pork shoulder with rice and the rotisserie chicken with mofongo. Both dish is excellent. The pork marinated very well the chicken is excellent. The mofongo is the best I have taste with garlic base. The rice dish have a choice of side. Since they run out of the sweet plantain, they give me a choice of their special made salad -  ensalata guineo en escabeche. This salad I have never seen before. It is chicken gizzard with plantain. The sauce or the dressing is out of the chart. \n\nOther than their regular menu, they have hot deli food that are cook ready to serve only on weekend. They showcase the special salad I have mentioned above. The pig feet also in Friday only deli dish is excellent. The skin and meat fall off the bone. \n\nService is excellent. Now the secret is out. Go enjoy it.",

    "text": "I am using this restaurant to mark my 100 review. This will be the restaurant I will likely repeat when I come back to New Orleans. This is one of my favorite restaurants in New Orleans. Each reservation or walk in is allowed for 1.5 hours dining in the prime evening by the restaurant. The restaurant offer blue music while eating. The musician is very good and talented. They can kick into high gear or take it slow like Big Easy. \n\nThis restaurant located Marigny area. This is a hypies area. Many people around this area are care free. But the restaurant is considered a high end even though they are located in this area. We love the performance by the musician. The guitar and harmonica have their solo highlight display the talented tune. The singer also great and the song is about the daily life. \n\nTonight we have order the Two Run Farms Lamb Sliders, Beer Braised Kurobuta Pork Belly, Bleu Cheese Stuffed Dates, Seared Scallops, Crab Dra Diavolo Cannolloni and Deviled Yard Egg. Most of the dishes have a choice of small or large quantity. Our first dish is the Deviled Yard Egg. The egg filling include seasoned egg yolk. It garnish with seasoned chop vege and top with deep fry broccoli flower. You will experience with crispy, sweet vege, and salty paste taste. The second dish Bleu Cheese Stuffed Dates. The Dates wrap in bacon and drizzle with sweet vanilla balsamic vinaigrette. The Bleu Cheese is stuff in the Dates and the combination allow for salty first then sweet (bacon to sweet dates). The third dish is  pork belly. This is my favorite dish in the restaurant. The pork belly is slice in rectangular cube. They pork belly is actually braise to soft the texture then slightly sear at the outside. It place on Chinese flat bread and garnish in the pickle cucumber. When you place the pork belly at your tongue, you can feel the pork belly fat actually melt away. This is actually a Chinese technique to cook the pork belly in pressure cooker and braise in slow fire. This is a dish should not miss. The fourth dish is the Crab Dra Diavolo Cannolloni. This is fresh pasta with spicy crab meat filling. It is cook with tomato sauce with caper.  The pasta is refreshing. The fifth dish is the Lamb Slider. The lamb meat is grounded and seasoned. It cooks over the open flame and top with tomato creamy sauce. The last dish is the seared scallop. The scallop is seared and serve with charizo, red lentils and bok chai. \n\nOverall we enjoy the great music over the meal. I have order the local brewer beer - southern pecan beer. It is great to go with the meal. The service is great. I am award this restaurant with five star to start my 3 digit review.",

If you have a group that join you, they will smell like BBQ when you you hug them good bye :) \n\n66 QPot restaurant name if I guess it right, it mean 66 Street BBQ and Hot Pot. Nice name. It tell you what they serving before you walk in. I would said it is 4.5 stars restaurant. I also would said this may be the best money can buy for hot pot and Korean BBQ combo in Tampa Bay Area. \n\nPlenty of selection for the buffet. The buffet hot pot is $23, Korean BBQ is $27 and combo is $30 per person. Good meat, seafood and veggies selection. A lot fun to eat it with friends. Don't go by yourself. They have 4, 6, 8 and 10 people table. \n\nTo eat this, you may need a bit of cooking skills. You need to broil and grilled technique. There are also plenty of sauces that you can mixed for dipping. Choose your soup base to start for hot pot. Limit three BBQ meat at a time. Once finished, you can order more. \n\nIt is good place to pass your time. Skip dessert and salad bar first. Enjoy!",

    "text": "To begin my 1800 series, Sushi Sho is legit on tasting the good sushi. It is a good show on the sushi they made. I would said this restaurant is 4.5 stars in my book. Not yet 5 stars. Since no 1/2 stars,  5 stars is given.\n\nI got the $80 nigiri omakase. I believe this is the best value of all. It is actually good to have about $5 a piece sushi for good quality ingredients. My omakase is 17 pieces and includes a appetizer and dessert. The topping is actually enhancing the taste. Since this is trade secret, I only going to tell you, the topping including citrus family sap, Perilla, scallions. \n\nThe sushi was perfectly arranged. It has wasabi hide underneath the fish and many already has the whiskey barrel soy sauce. These sushi has been sauce right amount of sauce. As a result, you no longer use any soy sauce that over dipping kill the fish taste. That is the art for this restaurant with some of citrus family sap, soy sauce and wasabi. This is where a great sushi chef be. \n\nMy 17 pieces include fish from Japan, local catch and international catch. The local catch has baby amber jack, gulf shrimp. It is good to prepared to the specific pieces of good sushi. I also like the surprising piece not in the menu such as Isaki. This is a tree trunk Japanese fish.  Very interesting fish with the skin attached. \n\nI like the Hokkaido scallops, medai, king salmon, and big eye tuna. I also like the appetizers with big eye tuna carpaccio with special ponzu sauce. The service is good. Very attentive sinc",

On the topping, they have and item like fried slice lotus root. That is unique at it on way. \n\nIn addition, they mix the ingredients separately with sauce or flavor. Their worker are well train and costume to your order. They ask you you want light, medium or heavy sauce. It give you adjustment for not too sweet or salty of your food. Great choice.

The pastry includes beef and chicken fluffy pastry. Other than it. It has many pastry to select. Some thing sweet or salty. \n\nPrice are affordable. Many Columbian has done here.

Because Dale Mabry Carrollwood area is definitely a restaurant pocket. With that said, I think will be a good contributor to the community with great food with easy selection. \n\nI like the new restaurant with outside seating that allow many dog owners gladly visit the restaurant.

You can have kabob, bowl, sandwich, pita, salad, and piadinas. We got the salmon bowl with Mediterranean Salad Trio. I am good with that. The best is salmon kabob with roasted veggies and quinoa. This is very good dish. The salmon is fresh and grilled very well. I like roasted veggies with a lot flavor. I would go for double roasted veggies incomparable to quinoa. \n\nThe manager did make around our table to see how is our food. I also like to suggest the Mediterranean Lamb Kafka as starter if you happen to visit them.",

I award them to five stars due to a lot of meat is pack to one taco, juicy, great taste, nice garnish.

Elizabeth is from Columbia and her husband is from Peru. Peruvian grilled meat is very tasty. \n\nThe lunch and dinner menu seem like the same. We have order the Falda and Lomo de Cerdo - grilled skirt steak and grilled pork chop tenderloin. The Falda is equivalent to Churrasco in Argentine dish. The meat should be at the low section of cow a long flat cut of skirt steak from the \"plate\" of the cow. The skirt steak is actually diaphragm muscle of the cow but in low section. Some one may serve you the skirt steak on the upper section which not as good as the low section. This restaurant also serve the upper section skirt steak dish call Vacio. Which is internal flank plate. Today the Falda came with the home made chimichurri sauce. You also allow to select one side. I have select the sweet plantain. All dish came with salad in the plate. To eat Falda, cut along the meat to the direction of the meat grain with small strip. You will enjoy more with cut since the Falda come in strip against the meat grain. I can finally said I found a reasonable price churrasco that comparable to Cuban churrasco that serve in Miami ($18.95) at Tampa. My wife dish is the grill pork chop. Seem like the preparation is first fried then grilled. The pork chop is marinate with rosemary, salt and pepper. This chop is good since they are sealing meat juice when they prepare it. \n\nOverall the restaurant is not busy and you get the service from the owner. A few thing they may be able to improve is have the lunch menu price that can attract more customer. Adding the pre-meal item such as bread or soup. The decoration of the restaurant display the mozaic of the local Peruvian art and painting. The restaurant back door is open to ventilating the food smell. So pick the seat close to the front to avoid food smoke.",

We were here when Genghis Flan playing here. Parking is challenge since the restaurant have a lot of traffic. If you come after 7:00 pm, you can park at the value pawn shop after they close. \n\nTonight dinner we have begin with crab stuffed butternut squash. Butternut squash is a very difficult cooking material to be use, however, the chef did a very good job to prepare it with crab meat and citrus hollandaise source. The squash filled with crab meat area is extremely soft and sweet to eat. \n\nOur main course is chicken mole and beef tenderloin. The chicken is very juicy in curry source top over comb read arepa. Who can think about the combination of the dish. It is getting better with the preparation on the beef tenderloin. The dish come with 2 pieces of 4 oz tenderloin in port wine source. It grilled to perfect with beef juice seal inside. This dish also come with bacon wrap asparagus. Bacon is good with any food but who can think the combination of crispy bacon wrap with bacon juice drip into the asparagus. It also come with mash potato cake. The mash is well season and the top is bake to crispy. \n\nI am usually not given out 5 star. The cooking and the mixture of the material and taste is well balance. The food give me a wow and unique factor.",

I learn a lot from the owner of the restaurant how Memphis BBQ is different than most BBQ. Memphis main focus is on the pig. While Kansas may be Florida BBQ are focused on the cow meat. \n\nWe have sampler plater with a choice of two meat. We have selected their famous baby back rib and the BBQ wings. We also order a pull pork Sammich. The owner told me the pull pork from the good part of the pig that carry a bit fat but contributing to the taste. The pull pork is slow cook over 12 hours. The rib is smoke for about 7 hours. It is fall off the bone. No knife is needed. Both of the rib and pull pork are very delicious. \n\nThe wings is grilled with sweet sauce. Very good. The side is amazing. We have grilled corn. Mmmm good. We have the collar green and fried okra. Good southern food. Corn pudding is yummy. \n\nBlame Andrew for hiding this place for long time. This is best in the bay for me now.",

It poof the service can keep up with group. \n\nToday I have order the Vaca Frita. Vaca Frita is flank steak in thin pieces. It is first deep fried and then hot plate grilled. I specifically ask them to make it crispy.  Which mean make the outside burn a bit. The Vaca Frita is easily separate into shredded beef with folks. They usually top with grilled onion. A twist of lemon juice can be added to enhance the flavor.  My dish comes with sweet plantain and I have added fried yucca. \n\nI have been here many times but have not give a review.

We got a free drink jug and T shirt. \n\nWe were surprise they are not busy during 6:00 pm. May be they just open a few days ago and not many people know about it. We have ordered the Far East sandwich and the brisket. Because it is dry rub, it generated the crispy outside crush. This Brisket was grilled for 12 hours according to the manager. The meat is ver juicy. They have two cut available for you choices. Either chop or slice. Slice is the best to preserve the juiciness. Our two side are fried whole okra and bacon mac and cheese. The side is a bit blend but the BBQ is tasty. \n\nThe Far East is the surprise. The use of the sauce is awesome. It is pork with kimchi, toasted sesame seed and cilantro. Yum sandwich. I would recommend this sandwich. The service is very attentive. I also order the craft soda with grilled lemonade. Very sour. Ok.",

They also have two story of book. I normally not walk to the back separate building on the second floor. It has a bridge connect to the parking and to the performance art center. The most impressive is the movie, music CD renting for free. You can check out the Sundance festival awarded movie to oriental martial art movie. We have enjoyed many nights with their movies and they are freeeeeeeee!!!!!!! You also can get HBO miniseries and they have those collections like games of throne. \n\nAt the back of the library, there is a acoustic stage hold for Tampa Volunteer Orchestra. You can check their schedule when they performed here. I would suggest visit them after six because the street parking then is freeeeeeee!!!  They have 4 weeknights open late to 9 or 8 pm.

When we were there, the food, service, food delivery is great. We did not find anything to complaint about. In fact, it is on timing. \n\nThe food - base on the name, it is a seafood and steak place. Some of the chef are Greek, as a result, it has bit tend to Greek spice. We have order the Clam Casino. It is top with bacon, bread crumbs, bell pepper and sweet base sauce. It is desirable. I have not have this dish before. \n\nOur entrees are the special of the day. 10 oz rib eye with stuff mushrooms. The mushrooms stuffing have crab meat. The rib eye is tender and good. My wife has the Atlantic Salmon top with shrimp and octopus. The octopus is perfectly grilled. \n\nFood won't considered the best but the selection of the material is fresh and top quality. Price is reasonable. We spent less than $50 for two. Since it has somewhat wow factor. They deserve to great in my book.",

I wonder they do it here. \n\nWe were here many time for the Sunday morning Thai market and eateries. I like this place because it serve my home country neighbor country food. It is very similar to my country. The food here very similar to the vendors of Friday night market in my home country. Only different is you have to wait on line to order. \n\nAlways come here with two people or more. You need to divide and conquer. The noodle line is long. Here one person in line while the other person go to buy other food. Always put your name down on the coconut ball and it will be ready before you leave the market. Once you got some of the food, feed the person in line for noodle then go get the drink for Thai tea, longan drink or coconut drink. Once got the drink go back to the noodle line to help the bowl of soup noodle. This is always our strategy for this market.  \n\nThe soup noodle is the best. It is very light food. They have thin, medium or widest noodle size to chose. You can chose beef or pork base noodle. \n\nI also like their dessert. Many to chose from. Grill chicken, steak or pork stick is grilled on the spot. The also have wok cook food like the curry, pad Thai and more. \n\nThe best time is November to December and March to May. When it is not too hot. The weather is pleasant. At special event, they perform the Thai traditional dance.",

I really not a fan of it. I like many choices of the ingredients to be add on. Only a few need additional money. Which is I can skip. \n\nMy last visit is the restaurant did give me freedom to separate the rice from the ingredients and sauce. Allow me just to mixed the ingredients only. I also like just select the Ahi tuna and salmon without add into premixed spiciness. This is much better quality because the tuna is dice close to a inch cube. Big size for mixed your on poke. I give them an A in this matter. By separating the ingredients from rice make this mixed more flavorful. Now I can combine many sauces with the raw fish and ingredients. Some of the ingredients included crab salad, corn, mango, red cabbage, cucumber, edamame, masago and more. These are the ingredients included part of the bowl price. \n\nI would love to have the sweet eel sauce, ponzu sauce and poke sauce to add together. This is my favorite mixed sauce. At the end you add the fried onion and fried garlic to add the crunchy and extra taste. \n\nOverall experience is great. We have party of eight and enjoy our moments of poke. This place also has hibachi and sushi burrito.",

This place serves Mexican Street Taco where they bring Mexico to Tampa Bay. They serve regular taco with beef steak, chicken, sausage. What them street vender like food is the intestine and beef tongue. They cook to the over the hot plate. This type food is not for to go order. You will enjoy more when you eat it there. They have two hot sauces that you can add. The green one is avocado hot sauce. I cannot guess what the orange color hot sauce is. The taco also accompany a bowl of lime on the side of you want to add it. \n\nThe taco is extremely affordable - $1.75 to $2.50 each. If I hang nearby there I may come in for snack. The best taco is Chorizo and the Tripa (sausage and intestine). These two tacos make the meat crispy and have slight burn meat sensation. It is very good. I will come back to check them out again.",

Be brave and order this appetizer. It tastes like regular beef meat. Thank to Steve to organize the UYE Latin Crawler to get to know this restaurant the first time. \n\nThe ambient is nice and the restaurant is pack with people during lunch time. We have the free sample on the appetizer with potato or fried yucca in cream cheese sauce. I like the yucca with cream cheese. \n\nMy entree is fried fish top with shrimp, mussel, and squid in fish broth. The restaurant did a good job on the on the fish broth. If you use the can fish broth, you need to be careful on the saltiness in the mix. This restaurant is balance their broth with a good technique not to overpower the taste and maintain light level of salty. The squid is well prepared with the softness of the texture. The shrimp count may be in the range of 10 to 15 counts a pound which means larger shrimp. When the restaurant prepares seafood you are looking for the fresh material. The seafood is really fresh and keeps in the quality. \n\nThis is a restaurant serve a lot ceviche, Peruvian stir fried or deep fried. I would said they are definite are very good on this end. I have not tried their grilled meat dish and that is yet to come. Service is a bit headache since we have a group of 30. They may be able to improve at in this end when they facing busy condition.",

This one may be the best representing. Although the restaurant introduce a lot of pan Asia food, but predominantly is Malaysian street food. The Chinese has immigrated to Malaysia long time ago. A mix marriage with local Malay people and create a generation call Nyonya. This people combine the Chinese cuisine and Malay cuisine and ultimately have this mix cultural food. \n\nLaksa is one of the good example. This spicy soup base rice noodle dish is created of the combination of the Chinese rice noodle in the use of Malay lemon grass material. The Prawn Mee is another example. The soup base is spicy Malay spice from shrimp shell and head. The noodle, pork, slice of shrimp are Chinese touch. \n\nChar Kway Teow is stir fry flat rice noodle. In Malaysia you can ask them to add the sambal - spicy shrimp paste in the noodle. It make more interesting. Have you try the Roti Canai. In Malaysia, this item is a hand craft. The chef actually has to stretch this dough to thin piece and pan fried on the hot plate grill. In Malaysia you can ask them to add egg, goat meat, onion. Can you feel the gulai (Malay for curry) of the Roti is different then any curry. It is different from Indian or Thai curry. The spice for Malaysian curry is sophisticate because they use wet curry powder. \n\nI would encourage you step out from your comfort zone to try this Malaysian dish including the mee goreng, Hokkkien mee. Unfortunately the satay here is still not close enough per Malaysian standard. I was able to give them 5 stars is to make sure the Orlando kitchen crews have left and they can stand their own ground to support this store. They did not disappoint me. They are quite good.

One of my non Yelp friend told me about this place. Plus when you have priority list of the restaurant in you book mark with added distance to travel here, we take me 7 month to hit this book mark. But no regrets and I will return. Blame on Todd and Melissa hidden this place very well :) Can believe I bum to them while I visit. \n\nNow about the restaurant. I like the concept of tapas and open garage. The tapas is very close to small plate. For two people 3 dish is enough but it does not stop you to order more. Instead of spending money for two dish at most restaurant, here you can try one more dish. I also like the open garage drink area with pool table. It make this place lively. \n\nThe skill of the chef. We have order the Miller, Kevin and Destin. We started with The Kevin with Blacken Redfish. The fish was handle well. Most chef either charcoal or not blacken enough. This chef make it just right. Blacken spice burn but not charcoal. The accompanying black-eyes pea and grit is good match. The Destin mixer of seared fillet tip, spice shrimp and sausage (soppressata) make this dish over the top. The many step preparation make this dish great to taste and put in the creamy pasta. My favorite is the miller. You can kill for this dish. The duck breast was marinated and blacken. A good duck breast need to cook roughly at medium rare to medium. The reason is medium rare is too chewy and the medium is to well done. This one just right. It has meaty bite but not chewy. Good technique. I am not going elaborate the accompanying side. Go find out yourself. \n\nService is good. Love the atmosphere and food. Can't wait to return.",

The Syrian has more heavy spice that I like. It actually marinated into the meat. \n\nThe special item we had is not the so call \"Babaghanoush\", it call Mtable. It is grilled eggplant, tahini sauce, yogurt and garlic. It drizzle with olive oil. I love this dish. We have the mixed grill with Shish Tawook (chicken cube), Shish Kefta (grilled ground beef) and Shish Kabab ( Beef or Lamb cube) I like the marinated, it went deep into the meat. They have the best chicken cube in town. We also have the grilled fish sandwich which is less than $6. Great value. Fish fillet is big. Love it. \n\nThis restaurant own by husband and wife. Please give them a visit, you will like it.",

The chicken is well marinated and grilled perfectly. I like their side with ginger slaw, Mac slaw, kimchi rice, and coconut rice. All in good flavor. \n\nI learn that you can call ahead for your order and pick it up. The food truck in rotation everyday. Please check their face book page for location.

Now it has hosted many events, music venue, and play. \n\nI can imagine the people watch the movie in this theater must have great experience in late 1920. Now the theater retrofit with air condition and they are comfortable. The best seat may be the second floor balcony middle three front rolls. It is very close to the stage.

This tell their Italian food is close to Italian taste. It almost can said \"it is like my mom cooking\". For for Asian like me I cannot tell what is truly Italian food. I only can judge what is good on the table. \n\nWe order the Fratelli Special pizza. It has pepperoni, sausage, meatball, mushroom, onion and black olives. We got the  12\" pizza. The pizza was delicious and the ingredients is nice not like typical pizza. We also got the garlic knots. It is dry at the bottom with good garlic and cheese sprinkled all over. We also got the  finger food an old bay wings. The owner was nice enough to give us extra three wings to make up the size is too small. \n\nIf you have budget, or just one a slice of pizza ( they by slice too), or good Italian food.

Since there is no 1/2 stars, I given them five stars. \n\nIt is good to see somethings different along the Bruce B Down. This restaurant come in to replace typical restaurants along this street. Price is reasonable on the lunch buffet. The food is fresh and cook very well. We have the goat curry. They do not have heavy goat smell which is perfect. The chicken masala is good curry to go with rice or the nan. Their nan is not at the buffet tray which is I agree, they bring fresh from their kitchen which is a smart move. Somethings different from the other Indian food buffet is they provide the dosa to the table. It is good. \n\nService is good and attentive. So far not many people know about it yet.

The charshu pork are thick enough and well braise. \n\nWe also got the pork bun and ikamaru grilled squid. The charshu pork bun is a bit pricy. Bun is good not the best in Tampa bay but close enough.

The dishes I like are the Falda, Picanha, Lomo de Cerdo. Several people of my friend have tried their ribs and they like it. \n\nIf you come with a group of three, you can order the mix grill platter to share and you will have a chance for each type of meat. The Picanha is a bit salty but the marinated spice is well done into the meat. The best dish is still the Falda. \n\nThey have the lunch special now use 10 to 12 dollars. I like the full portion better. \n\nThe Chicha Morada is improving from my previous visit. The trick is telling them not to put too much ice in the cup before they pour it. The taste will be more Peruvian bean taste when they did that.",

The Arepa that they have served using the imported Venezuela cheese. This cheese is almost like mozzarella cheese. When it melt, you can pull like small string. Thousands yard long. May be not. May be you can make it to Guinness record by single pull cheese string. Good Luck:)\n\nThis is a small guy that make it to the big stage. Now they open the restaurant to serve this food. It is truest Cinderella story make it to the big stage. What make them successful is the first impact that make the customer want to comeback after one visit. The success reason are:\n1. Nice restaurant interior design to attract young and old crowd\n2. Great service that make you feel welcome\n3. Vibrant atmosphere created by the people who work there feel the Latino warm feeling \n4. Good food for the reason to come back \n\nThis was our second stop of restaurant night and we have ordered the Nico Sampler and Sopa de Res. In the sampler, every items are great especially the cachapas. The cachapas is made from sweet corn and they are good. The Sopa de Res is the beef soup and it is very good too. They told me the weekend special is their tripe soup and it usually sold out in the morning. \n\nOur waiter Rafael make our trip special and welcome. I am glad they hire the good personality and vibrant waiter. If you feel hungry at night when all restaurants have closed, they are the few open restaurant in the Bay Area. They open till 4 am in the week end. Go checkout and give them a shout if you like.",

Special beads are giving out when the Queen and King nominated dog pass by. \n\nThis a low profile parade compare to all other parade. What I mean low profile is you have to lower yourself by sitting at the sidewalk curb to watch the parade in the same elevation of the dog. Please come early so you can occupy a sidewalk curb. Some of the dog may approach you and you will have a chance to touch them or take a close up picture. This parade is not as good to watch in standing position. \n\nAlone the parade, there are promotion for the dog adoption, dog food, dog manicure, dog costume, dog treat, dog toy...... Some of the owner put a small dog and the baby and push along with the stroller, some of them carry their dog in the arm, movie set push cart. This is a fun parade with our four legs friend. Many children are in this parade. They give up candies and beads at the route. Some children run out from sidewalk curb to touch the dog when they see a cute one. This may be the only Mardi Gras Parade that is suitable for all ages.",

I am considered they are top store for devil crab in tampa. \n\nWe order one devil crab and they are huge. The whole ball is stuff with crab meat. They definitely worth for the money. It come with chip and drink. Do you know the breakfast special is only $5.99 and they give a lot. It includes sausage, ham, scrambled egg, and more. Big breakfast to share. \n\nAfter a true sit down visit, I feel they are one of the best in Tampa. It can be easily one of the most like in the bay. If you visit Tampa, this is one you should try. Sandwiches is famous here too but the devil crab is the jewel of the store.",

    "text": "Rare ethnic food # 64. Thai Street Food\n\nThis is noodle restaurant has a lot to boast about. It is first Thai street food in the Bay Area. Their menu concentrated on noodle with many different choices. It is a true 5 stars restaurant to my book. I once been to a street vendor in Singapore that received the Michelin Star. This restaurant will be our Tampa Bay Street Food That has Michelin star quality. \n\nWe started with Namtok Moo. It is the grilled slice pork with Namtok sauce with roasted rice powder. The marinated was good. The slice beef is great. Our fist entree is the Ba Mee Moo Dang. It is the BBQ pork with egg noodle. It is a dry both noodle dish. Very similar to Malaysia dry wonton noodle dish except they use BBQ pork. I like the sauce at bottom of the dish. So you need to mixed before you eat will help the flavor. The second entree is the Tew Pad Toon. It is the duck noodle soup. The duck is deboned. The duck is cook in the broil herbal soup. The soup base also from that. I think this dish win my heart. \n\nWe have a lot love for this restaurant. Although it is too far for me to visit but I will make the effort to revisit. I highly recommend this restaurant.",

    "text": "Great restaurant with low cost. This where you find Mc Donald meal is expensive compare to this restaurant. If they start a chain restaurant, it may be a nightmare for Mc Donald to compete. I believe they are the gem of the Bay Area. \n\nThe restaurant get a lot of foot traffic so come a bit early than lunch time. Unfortunately they close at 5 pm so no dinner. Just sad about this situation??? Dummy, you just have to take out and eat at night. However their soup noodle need to be eat there. \n\nI like their grilled pork sandwich. When they are at the old location, they usually run out of pork when it approaches to closing time. They serve many type of soup. I like their grill pork fresh roll. They also have different dessert in package and you just need to pick one. \n\nThe reason I have this review now is the best keep secret of all time. They serve the duck noodle only on Friday. They use to have this item in the menu at the old restaurant. However, they have not put this dish in the menu when they move to the current location. The duck is well braised with salt and seasoning into the meat itself. This is not a roast duck. If any Vietnamese restaurant use roast duck, it is wrong for duck noodle soup. The soup base is not regular pho spice. You can feel the natural bone taste in this soup. It comes with bamboo shoot. I like it better here due to the shoots are not sour. I have been to many place for duck noodle but non like this. The duck meat and the soup are the one I love the most. Please remember to come early and only Friday serving only. They have limited bowl. Once they are gone they will not serve it again. You also need to like to eat from the bone for this soup. \n\nI have been here many time but never review them, I have kept this duck noodle soup secret for years in the current location. Only the loyal old customers know about this. Don't forget about the boba drink. They are very affordable. Here you go, the secret is out.",

They also have special of the night menu also with different sushi with picture. The pictures of the sushi look good. We are not trying that because we have few more stop for different restaurants. \n\nThe ramen soup base have the miso, shoyu, tonkatsu, shio butter or the mix of tonkatsu and miso. Among of all the soup base, the tonkatsu base is the holy grail of the ramen. It is from pork marrow bones depend on how long it was cook. They were kind enough to allow us taste the soup before order. \n\nThe Ramen was good and not too salty since they are not the miso base. Overall they are good to try and the ramen came out in 10 minutes. Base on the interior and the people who serve us, they deserve 5 stars. We will be back to try the sushi.",

It is easy located at Armenia a few block south of the Hillsborough. Love the setting inside. It does not matter dinner or lunch, it is cloth napkin service. The best time and value is the Saturday and Sunday lunch because weekday you have to return to work and you cannot stay long. \n\nThe restaurant is my first time try on. I have tried many Brazilian and fell that they are too salty or too much of MSG in the seasoning. However, this restaurant is different in very good way. The seasoning is perfect and not over power. Love the food here, it come with wave. I mean tidal wave!!! Please pace yourself for the meat. There are 10 different cut of beef. In addition to the beef, they have chicken, chicken heart, ham and pork. My favor is the chicken heart. The beef have Picanha, Alcatra...... Forget about the names; just ask the waiter to cut for you if it is look good for you. Love it, eats it; what do you waiting for if they already bring in front of you. \n\nKim is the owner that super nice to us. Our table got free three different deserts - the tres-leches, tiramisu, and Flan. I like the tres-leches. They make the tres-leches very spongy and soak well with the milk. This is a great desert that make in Spanish recipe. I forgot to mention, there is more behind the all you can eat salad bar. I like the mango salsa. They also prepare the paella, different type of chicken at the salad bar. \n\nThe service is good, the meat in good material, the choice is a lot, and the people are nice. Love this place and will be back. They deserve a five star for all the above.",

They even pull out a virgin Black Widow for a non alcohol soft drink. It was good for them. The margarita was the best among my friends because it come with fruit press for the drinks before pour.

    "text": "Authentic Cuisine #60. Mexican dessert. \n\nThis dessert store is one of the kind. I was surprised to bump into it when I shop at this plaza. It has minimum 50 different dessert items that you can choose. The make up of the dessert is eye pleasing. \n\nI started with cucumber soft drinks to quench my thirst. The cucumber water was fresh and nice. We got esquite as salty dessert. It is the corn and cheese. It is warm and nice. I got the strawberry Fresada. It has chili powder, strawberry slice, some kind Mexican candy. The drink has strawberry smoothie. It is typical interesting drink. \n\nWe also got the popsicle. It has fresh food. Many choices of popsicle. They also has churros ice cream. They also carry tapas like shrimp cocktail in Mexican style. One thing for sure. Your experience here will be one of the kind. It is not like your typical dessert that you normally have.",

The actual restaurant is actually on the right of the plaza in the same location. This time we get to the right main restaurant. The menu here is definitely different and plentiful to select. \n\nWe have order the salmon special and their beef soup. The food portions are huge. Material is well prepared. Value is definitely there. The salmon is grilled and top with mango sauce. The accompanying sides are rice tostone and fried yucca. The fish is grilled to the way I like it. The beef soup is one of the best. This time we are asking the soup with grilled palomino steak. It has yucca and beef meat in tiny pieces. \n\nWhen we eat there the next door has salsa music. We saw a lot waiter in and out. We walk across the building door and found the dancing room is part of the restaurant. Very nice. Fern need to be here. Now you eat, drink and play in one place.",

I have the OX tail that was cook for long time to make it soft. It cook in the Caribbean spice and has a lot of Indian influence. The tail must be slow cook to make it separate from the bone. This dish accompanied with cabbage and the bean rice. You can have the choice of white rice. \n\nI also have the flower drink - Sorrel. They prepared it and put in the cup and store in their refrigerators. Sweet treat. They have some other food please check it out. They also have fried fish. You can call ahead to have your fish prepare before you arrive. It will take some time to fried. The owner of the restaurant is very friendly. I like about this mom and pop shop.",

The new restaurant do bring a lot good to the neighborhood especially for blue collar workers. If you need a good box food, I recommend this is the place. For me, I prefer to eat there because they just prepare fresh. \n\nWe started with the pork spring roll and chicken egg roll. These rolls are the complimentary from the restaurant. We added the charshu Bao. The spring and egg roll is freshly fried. Very good. The Bao has good steam bun. The price come with three Bao which has a lot of meat. Love the Bao and sauce on it. \n\nWe got the bulgogi and grilled pork noodle bowl. The bulgogi is the best. The steak of the bulgogi is soft and tender. Good to bite. The grilled pork has good seasoning. It is a bit different then most Vietnamese food but I like this way. \n\nI like restaurants set the food in right price. This restaurant make it to the list. It is convenient to have the box during pandemic. If you cannot finished, you can carry it home.",

The best thing is affordable cocktails. $4 not bad at all. I got the midnight train and the Frozen All American Margarita. The midnight train is ok. But the Frozen American is wonderful. Next time I will try Long Island ice tea. \n\nWe have the Rib-Eye steak 12oz and Signature Ribeye Steak 14 oz. the regular ribeye just grilled but the signature is marinated. Both are really good because good quality meat. The signature ribeye is marinated in sweet sauce. It is excellent. We also good 12\" pepperoni pizza and the raspberry chipotle wing. The pizza is ok but the wing is really good.  \n\nThe only thing that need improvement is the reception. It need some work. When the table is available, they need to hurry up shorten the wait line. It just too much for reception to take phone order and lead to table. The service for the table is really good. They have enough people to handle the food delivery and tablE service.",

Now seeing them doing well, it is encouraging business in Brandon. There will be wait if you are not there early. I was there on Sunday ahead the church crowd. There is already 20 minutes wait. We take the breakfast bar without wait. \n\nWe have the Dakota - it is flat iron steak with bread, toast and a side. I got the grit. The steak is delicious with the right seasoning. Steak was cook well and compliment to the chef skill. We also got the churro waffle. This dish come with 4 quarter pieces waffle with whip cream and caramel syrup. The waffle is crispy. A bit oily but is tasty. Very unique dish. \n\nI saw many dish fly out the serving window. The quantity of the food and presentation of the food was really nice. Service is attentive.

Very nice soup base. The accompanying veggie is very well decorated with arrangement. This is my first time to have this soup. I have empty the whole bowl. \n\nWe also have other items such as the lemongrass grilled beef sandwich, wonton noodle soup, shrimp chip. By the way, they have 20 different sandwich to try. Some include vegetarian ham. Ham for vegetarians???!!!\n\nPinellas, you don't know you have pearl in your area. Please check them up.",

We have try their vinaigrette cilantros sauce and we like it. We also try their ginger citrus and coconut sweet potatoes sauce. I can said the sauce went through good R&D. \n\nA few thing they can improve are the BBQ chicken and steak. I feel their steak do not worth for the upgrade unless I can order the medium rare steak and chop up. Steak is over done. However I have to tip my hat to the teriyaki chicken and spicy tuna. Their Brussels sprouts, mushroom and broccoli are favorable to add on. The base I would recommend the forbidden rice, noodle and cauliflower rice. \n\nOne other thing can improve on is to fill up the bowl. Don't let it 80% full.",

    "text": "This is memorable night from The International Culinary School at The Art Institute of Tampa. This dinner no doubt is one of the best in the Bay now. The cost is low, the food is great, and we even get Chef Treatment. Tonight dinner is one that closer to my heart. The restaurant or the institute is naming as Tutored Chef and they only serves dinner on Thursday and Friday night from 6 pm to 8 pm. Please call 813-393-5395 for reservation.\n\nThe menu has ten items to select. Each item not more than $6.95. You also can try their special combination of the ten items from the menu with three to five course meals. The three courses is $13.95, four courses is $15.95, and five courses is $17.95. This is a steal and price buzzer. They are currently serving the spring menu. The summer menu will be start at July. I would encourage the patron go to support them. However, if you want to get the best cooking skill, come after four to six week later when they are familiar with their menu. That is when the food is goooooood. The food and the tip are going to the school. You can tip extra with cash and mention it is for the people who serve you. It is good for the student who serves you. \n\nTonight we have everything in the menu. The restaurant starts with crouton with herb dip and enhance flavor butter. Then follow by baked empanada with passion fruit and Cajun Spice for opening. We started with grilled asparagus in asparagus puree and bacon bit. This is a well presented dish and it is elegantly presented. The asparagus is well cook and go well with the Canadian type bacon. The second initial entr\u00e9e is the Egg - it is soft broil fried egg serve over the Mushroom Ragout. When the egg is cut, the egg yolk is spilled over the mushroom. The mushroom is cook with wine sauce. When it mixed with the egg yolk, it has added the flavor. The egg is fried with crust and tasty to eat. The third initial dish is the soup du Jour. The soup is one of the student creations. Creamy soup is served with smoke bacon. \n\nThe main dish starts with the lamb - Chilled Grilled Leg of Lamb serve over the Israeli Couscous. It also has the touch of the Chimichurri sauce that makes the grilled lamb more desirable. The second main dish is shrimp - The shrimp is cook with Tarragon Tomato Relish and Chive Oil. It serves over the risotto. The taste is like old bay seasoning for the Maryland Crab. It goes well with the risotto. The third main dish is pork - They are two type pork is served here. Braise Smoked Pork Shanks and Saut\u00e9ed Pork Tenderloin.  These are two different type of preparation. And both are good. It also serves with Potato Gratin, Baby Carrot, and snow peas. It is a balance meal. The fourth main dish is the beef - Slice Grilled Beef is place on top of the crouton and place on top of sweet Onion Marmalade. The onion is saut\u00e9ed to soft and good for the mixed with the beef.\n\nWe close the night with Blueberry financier on blueberry sorbet and blueberry compote. It is pretty muffin cake over blue berry ice cream and syrup. We also have the Chocolate Marquis top with Ice Cream and roasted pistachios. Chocolate is same as mousse. \n\nI was going to post this review for my 200 hundred reviews. But restaurant this good needs to be shared. I am thinking do a UYE on the end of July or begin of the august when the student chefs get familiar with the summer menu.",

They has seating area for the customers if they decide to dine in. At old location many customers order and eat at the car. Second, the food preparation time cut to half. Old kitchen need a long wait if customers in front of you. \n\nWe track down their new restaurant location and finally we have a visit. Before you visit, you need know a few thing. First they cook the food when you order. They are not like other fast food fried the chicken and sit on the rack until customers order it. As a result the food is fresh and delicious. So, you need some patience to wait for them to cook your food. But you can order ahead by phone to cut down your wait time. Second, if you dine in, you need to wear non expensive clothing, because the food smell will stick on you. No leather accessories because it will stick at the leather and difficult to remove. \n\nI like Kay's chicken because they prepare it fresh. They use light coating not like other fast food have thick coating that you cannot feel the chicken. Their chicken is Chicago style which is rare in Tampa Bay Area. So go get your own.",

Sometimes I think they are too creative on the name that I could not figure out what is the really the ice cream flavor. \n\nToday I have the porky and the banana pudding. The porky is the vanilla ice cream with bacon. The ice cream is great. The bacon is good. The banana pudding is the one I like among the two. \n\nThey do have taste try. My wife always ask me why you buy the one that I did not try. I said to her I already try all other flavor definitely buy the one I did not try.",

You can have white, wheat, gluten free or Keto friendly crust. I am going for the wheat dough. The guy who made it very skill. He stretched and throws to the air spinning with further stretching to thin crust. It is a show. \n\nThen you chose your sauce. You don't need to choose one sauce. I got the extra virgin olive oil then ask them to add the basil pesto. This is the first time I see pizza using basil pesto sauce. Unique. Next step is type of cheese. I am going to mozzarellas. Then the veggies, I pick the mushroom, sundry tomatoes, minced garlic, basil leaves, jalape\u00f1o and olive. First time also I see pizza add garlic. Then the meat. I got the sausage, pepperoni, meat ball, salami. That complete my master piece. \n\nI also ask them to top with balsamic drizzle. Love it. I don't eat a lot of pizza. But I would recommend this pizza. You can add the combo with drink and chip of gelato or salad.",

We were attract to the recent post in the talk by Nick S. for the highly decorate 5 star restaurant. We have to check this out tonight. The whole street is dark at that area except this restaurant. People line out at this place before their turn to order. The store front is small and we have a suspicious this is good?\n\nThe restaurant look like a hipster place. The setup is efficient  allow the patron to order and they give you a code to pick up the food. The sitting area is limited. They have some table at the outside of the building. Today we have the Austinite taco, west coast taco, and the Texas flood taco. This is translated as Carne Asada Beef, grilled shrimp, and beef brisket. All meat is grilled to perfection. The Austinite came with caramelized onion and avocado. The Texas Flood has the chipotle BBQ sauce. The meat is grilled and have a lot flavor. The beef and shrimp is marinated. \n\nAll taco is $4.25, the burrito is $9.50, wet buritto is $10.25 and bowl is $9.25. You can order each combination at above package. The salsa of the chip is great. This place is affordable for the price, good quality food, perfect seasoning and flavor. As a result I have give them 5 star for the so little price we pay. The biggest price is to pay the gas to get there.",

    "text": "This is the Volvo dealer I have my car service and buy the next car. I have to drive 45 minutes to this dealer if I want my car service. It is far from my home but why I like them. The service here is great compare to all other service that I have received from different dealer. I have been to Toyota, Mazda, Ford, Honda dealer but none have come close to the service here. \n\nThe good thing of the dealer is by appointment and makes your life easier. I always get the free loaner car (newer model Volvo) from them while I have my car service. After the service, they have my car wash and vacuum. It is a treatment. Every time close to my service, I receive the coupon of 15% discount. They are very proactive. Another good thing is Volvo is made such that service only need to be done every 7500 mile compare to most car is done at 3000 mile. Each year I only need 2 services for each year. \n\nI bought my next car replacement here also. I waited for the internet special for the pre-own car sales. I normally buy the second hand car less than 30,000 miles and less than 2 years old. With the internet special, I got my car 50% from original MSRP price. Good price. I paid only $20,000. I always paid for additional manufacturer bumper to bumper cover up to 7 years and 100,000 miles. It only cost $1600 for this cover. As a result I bought a car that has more coverage (30,000 mile additional cover) than most cars. It has the luxury package such as BLIS, leather seat, moon roof, rear seat climate, road hazard and more. I believe they are general better than buying a new car. You can check their car fax with no accident.\n\nNow they have the eco boast car that is gasoline with 37 mpg. Please check them out. The other Volvo dealer may not offer the same even they are in Bay Area.",

We have made the reservation through the YELP App that through the open table. When we arrive our reservation is in place and we we're sit immediately. I like the reservation system in YELP.\n\nTonight we have order the Escargots En Casserole, Oysters Arnaud, Turtle Soup, Pompano David and Assorted Green. The first course is the Escargots En Casserole. The dish comes with six mini cup of escargots top with mini croissant. Each ceramic cup has the garlic herb and Pernod. I like to take out the pastry and dip in the garlic herb and top with the snail. It is good. The second course is the Oysters Arnaud. It bears the name of the restaurant due to the famous five pieces oyster prepare in five different ways. The first piece of the half shell prepare with shrimp, mushroom, green onion, herb and season in white wine sauce. The second piece is top with bacon, pimento, green onion and pepper. The third piece is top with artichoke hearts, garlic, fresh Parmigiano Reggiano and in the extra-virgin olive oil. The four piece is essence of Creole in eggplant and andouille sausage. The final piece is actually the Oyster Rockefeller with spinach and bacon and a touch of Pernod. These five pieces are great to eat experience the taste around the world. Got to have them when you visit the restaurant!!\n\nOur main course starts with turtle soup. This is unique dish that serve by many plantation near New Orleans. It has the game meat of the snapping turtle. It prepare in Creole sauce at tomato base. Our Assorted Green includes the hearts of Palm, butter lettuces, Arugula, Raddicchio and top with the duck crump crackling. It is serves with the Creole Mustard Vinaigrette dressing. Yum !! Pompano David is the fish that grilled with skin on fillet. It brushed with extra-virgin olive, lemon, garlic and fresh herb. The waitress was nice enough to split the order to two for the fish and green for each of us. \n\nWe have closed our night with a dessert The Banana Foster for two. The waiter will cook this dish in front of you. They start melt the butter, then they added the cinnamon and brown sugar and make the brown sauce. The exciting park is they flamed at table side with banana liqueur and dark rum. Banana is added to the sauce to cook and serve over the French Vanilla ice cream. This has end the evening perfectly. The waiter and waitress have an excellent service. They are quick to act and pick up the crump on the table. I have never seen a service like this. I would award six stars.\n\nThe up stair of the restaurant display the historic dresses from Mardi Gras at the pass. Please do not miss this opportunity if you visit this restaurant. They are locate at the stair next to the restroom up floor.",

We have order the lengua, tripa, asada, al pastor. I love the lengua and tripa. They are good flavor. The steak (Asada) was well seasoning, I like their way burn the steak a bit to bring out the aroma of the steak. The pastor has deep seasoning. Most of the taco place only lightly seasoning not bring out the good of the taco. Here did a good job. \n\nOn my next return, I will surely try the Cabeza, chorizo, chicharon, and carnitas. Food is reasonable price. You can call the number to place your order ahead and pickup without waiting. They are fluent in English. Since it is affordable, I am not paid your taco.",

The new owner creates the attractive menu. What you need to ask is their special. They do have separate chef special seafood items of the night other than the menu. I also like the bigger dining room with compare to old restaurants. The ventilation also improved from old setup. \n\nWe start the night with the fried calamari. The coating has a special flavor with seasoning. The dipping marinara sauce is fresh and different. I love it. Ingredients must be good condition to have the good sauce. \n\nMy wife have the chicken parmigiana with spaghettini with pink sauce. The chicken is breaded with marinated coating. It was crispy and tasty with cheese and marinara sauce. The pink sauce also interesting. My dish is a signature of the restaurant. I have the sacchettini with added grilled shrimp. This is the first time I try sacchettini. It is dumping stuff with pear and mozzarella. Then it cook in Gorgonzola Sauce. It is heavenly good. Highly recommend this dish if you have never have this Italian dish before. \n\nOverall the service and food is good. A VERY excellent Italian Restaurant. Please ask if you can bring your own wine.",

Many pieces that were displayed are very creative. This exhibition was sponsored by Vinik Family Foundation. A big thank to them to bring such a caliber artist to the city. \n\nThe art not just mimic the ancient famous paintings, it has our daily life movement in 2D or 3D art format. In fact, some of the art cannot even tell it is made from lego after you have snap the photo of those creation. The photo just look real. I like the eye position art, in some angle you could not see it but other angle completely show up with surprising picture. \n\nThe photographer superimposed with lego art is awesome with pictures. It is out of the world. It has the beauty for the right things. Such as a man using the lego umbrella in the rain, a lady in front of the ticket box office with her dress disintegrated. \n\nTip - go there every month since they swap out the art time to time. The art will be displayed for 3 months. Seem like each month they change out a few pieces. Weekend expect long line. There is parking at the entrance under the bridge.",

In this plaza, they are the only restaurant. Which mean perfect for parking spot since no other restaurant compete for car parking during the night. I can easily find a space to park in compare to many other restaurant which I have circular the area for parking. \n\nThe place in trendy. I like the modern decoration. \n\nService: the waitress know how to compliment the dress or shoes of the customers make lady customers feel they did the right thing. This added pleasures does go a long way. \n\nQC: I have observed the kitchen head chef QC every dish come out. This make the consistency of the food. I would said that is a big step to make sure the food come out correctly. \n\nKitchen: the new Noble Crust does have full equip big kitchen. It make all the food fly out without too much to wait. This is the reason why they are successful in this location. \n\nFood: we have the bistro steak, FGBLT, and the PEI mussel. The steak is cook to the temperature we have asked. It is good size of steak. It top over collars green with southern twist. The accompanying mash potato top with drizzle balsamic vinegar and green aioli. I like the steak top with green apple chimichuri. Very unique. The FGBLT is lay the fried green tomato as a base and layer with pimento cheese. Final touch top with glazed pork belly. The presentation is very nice. However the pork belly harmony is not there. I would said they need to work on the skin fat and meat combination. It need to be melt at your tongue instead a very chewy piece. I like the PEI mussel. It is cook with saffron broth. Most of the mussel I have either butter wine sauce or tomato red sauce. I like the way they have it with the southern twist with added andouille sausage. \n\nOverall, they are very good job with competitive price. It make me to revisit.

They also goyaza in ponzu sauce. It also come with two pieces of sweet tamago. Great box for lunch. \n\nThe lunch special has two roll for $10. It is good. I got the spider and yellowtail scallions roll. I like they prepare the soft shell crab has a lot of crab meat. Services is good.",

We usually ask for the fry and BBQ baked bean. They have special time to time for the full rack of the rib. \n\nThe decorations and slogans are hilarious.

The line is already build at entrance to be open during Friday night. Happy hour is for bar, lounge, and outside. \n\nWe started with the Duck Confit Taco. The skins is different for the taco. Good enough. The second dish is the chargrills oyster. I like this dish. Somehow the oil in the oyster make this dish taste very good. The third dish is the grilled Shishito Pepper. With a bit sea salt oil and grilled over open flame is great for the wine and cocktails. Our board dish is charcuterie board with different ham. This is perfect dish with the slide cure ham.

The smoke taste deep into the meat. The marinated of the rib has some fruity taste. Very good fall off the bone. Easy to eat. Must be cook for long time. I hope they maintain this quality.

After visited the restaurant, I found out the reason why. 50% of the food is fried here, it will be not great to have the take out. Eat there is the key. Because when you brought the food home, these food turn tougher. Especially the pork. \n\nWe started out appetizers as Salty Fish Pate. The pastry skin is very flaky and the salty fish is great. Our next appetizer is the Akra. This is malanga fritter with great coating with nice seasoning. Malanga is root veggies. It is interesting to be fried with coating. \n\nWe order the griot. It similar to chicharon in Spanish food. But the pork is seasoning before fried. Better than chicharon. It come with rice and bean and tostone. It also serve with spicy coleslaw and spicy red curry. This dish really need to be eat there. If not, the pork skin will be to tough to bite after you order to go and eat at home. You need to experience the crispy of just fried pork. \n\nI also got the Tassot Kabrit. It is marinated fried goat. The bone in chop meat is delicious and soft. It was not tough. May be just fry or the chef have good technique. \n\nOverall we like our food. A lot people order take out. Tip don't wear good clothes. Because you smell like fried food after eating. They need to improve the ventilation system.",

The next two dish is special Roll of the day and spicy tuna roll. This roll is big. The next dish is the velvety shrimp.

The rice is turmeric and serving in the clay bowl that heat up and make the rice crispy where they touch the edge. It top with grilled beef. I believe the beef has some lemon grass ingredients that make this grilled meat separated from other. The cuttlefish is stuff with ground pork and shrimp.

The use of volcanic rock stone heat up over 700 degree and grilled the food is a healthy way of cooking. In Taiwan, the meat is marinated and cook over the stone. It is not much of difference than this restaurant. \n\nThe lunch of the restaurant offer a better deal in smaller portions for experience if you don't want to spend too much money. For $12 you can have the sirloin, shrimp or ahi Tuna with a side during lunch. Recently they run the special for $18include steak and shrimp. \n\nThey have butter on the side if you want to grilled your meat with it. This type of cooking requires fresh seafood of premium grade of steak. It is not recommend for pork or chicken. \n\nThe food is tasty. It may require some minimum cooking skill to enjoy it. So who can blame if the food did not cook well. It was great to see the method is introduced in US. The dinner item is medium range in price compare to any steak restaurant.",

Their new intention and recreation is very trendy.\n\nStart with weakness. The sushi is a bit above average on the three rolls special. I have the spicy tuna, spicy white tuna mango, and cowboy rolls. The spicy tuna instead grind meat, I would prefer dice meat. The spicy white tuna mango is interesting. The cowboy roll is seared beef in sushi roll. All are creative. I think need to work on the flavor. \n\nThe bento box is amazing. The sashimi has very nice pieces of fish. They are very fresh and not fishy at all. The tempura bento also very nice. They have the best skill for tempura. A real Japanese technique is to glue each coating separately and creat needle type tempura look. If you see a smooth breaded coating, those are lazy type of cooking. He breading coating need to needle type. All bento box has very good fry rice. Love it. \n\nIn addition, the sashimi has fatty tuna, king salmon, madai, fluke.

It has more flavor when preparing correctly. Other than the add on, they also have large variety of sauce for selection. If you don't like to mixed your on bowl, you can get the premixed bowl.",

I would said this is 4.5 stars restaurant in my book not yet 5 stars. I round up the stars because they have the Jackfruit Smoothie that not many restaurant carry it. The smoothie is nice dessert. \n\nI got the pork chop, shred pork, meat cake and fried egg and rice. Seem like this is a popular dish that many has order. The combo of this dish is twelve dollars but it has everything thing I need. Pork chop is delicious. Meat cake is a fan. I also has the shrimp fresh roll. The roll is big can be share and come in to two. \n\nService is good and attentive. If I am visiting again, I would try their chef special. Ban Bun Hue. It is tapioca noodle.",

The flavor can be learn by many ice cream shop. I try all four flavors, and I like them all. I settled for two flavors. One is the loopy. It is with fruit loop and vodka fruit loop. You have to be 21 years old to try it. The other is the coconut blueberry. Both of them has wonderful taste. \n\nMy wife has chocolate bacon toffee. It sprinkled with candy bacon. BACON. Definitely people love the most in their food. It is gluten free also. The clerk is helpful and has knowledge about the ice cream flavor. This will help customers to make the decision.",

These items are the best. We have the three pig piggy. It is sandwich either three different way of pork. Grilled pork belly, fried pork, and ham. It was delicious. The fried coated pork is crispy. The side of potatoes tots also crispy. \n\nOur second dish is the duck flatbread. It is another creative item.

Beautiful interior design as a desirable to sit down and enjoy. Service is still need to improve. \n\nYou know if a restaurant will make it or not by just tasting the food. This is the restaurant I will repeat in the future. Food is very reasonable price and easy to select - may be not - it has huge selection. I love it. It make me to come back for more. They have good food presentation. Nicely decorated. Fast food chain of America, watch out, I can eat better food here. \n\nWe start with our entrees with Thinh An Special Noodle Soup and the Hue Style Beef Noodle Soup. I like the Thinh An Noodle. It has the clear noodle soup with seafood in it. Very good soup. My wife have spicy hue style beef noodle. Good but I like the special better. Then we move to the grille pork summer roll -  the appetizer. It is good. \n\nOur desert is what I search for some time. Hong Kong Waffle. They call it egg puff waffle. The waffle is puffy and crispy. Right baking. It come with two scoop of ice cream and two topping. I have the mango and coconut ice cream with assorted mochi and the blue berry mochi. Delicious. \n\nAdvice for the new comer. Come early at dinner before they are busy, get all the order in earlier. For the owner, I think open late and closing late is better. Breakfast usually don't get much sale. Usually people get one item and leave. Dinner people tendency to order more and get more sale. I will update on next visit.",

So come a bit early. \n\nI am only there once. I have already fall in love to this restaurant. I not sure they have same menu each day. They do have special every day. They have been opened since December. It is actually one of my clients told me about this restaurant since he knows I am yelping. I saw Mel and Mark review there. I decide to give them a try. \n\nAll right, let's talk about food. This is a Dominican Republic cuisine with a lot of twist. It looks like cafeteria style for you to pick the food. Their specialty is the Mongu. What actually Mongu. It smash plantain and made it like mash potato. But it is plantain base. You will not see it in the food tray as the display. You need to request them to get it from the kitchen. \n\nI did not go with the traditional two items special. I just pick a bit each from the tray. Today special is crab meat top on the salmon. The salmon is marinated and oven bakes. It creates the crispy crab meat when the crumb is cook. This is good. The oxtail is braised with sweet sauce. The oxtail meat can be pickup by the folk. The marinated sauce went into the bone. I was sucking to the bone pick up the last bit. It is that good. The third item is the paella with seafood -- clam, mussel, shrimp, and more. Good paella. A lot of food in one plate. \n\nThe bath room is clean and well up keep, the people are friendly, the food is GREAT, the price is affordable. They deserve to be pad at the back.

The meat and vege then can be wrap in the rice flour skin like the roll. They accompany with fish sauce to dip or use the tomato base chili sauce. We also have the deep fried pork large intestine. This is delicacy dish that eat it as crispy with sweet sauce. They marinate the intestine before deep fried. The outward is crispy and the inward is soft. Yummy. \n\nThe main dish is the dried scallop fried rice.  We have try many place for dry scallop fried rice. This is not the best but it is tasty enough. You can taste the high heat wok oil and create the scallop enhance taste in the rice which make this elegant. Second dish is the prince mushroom- Agaricus augustus the real name. This dish is only seasonable. If you lucky at the right time they may have it. It is a yellow mushroom when you slice them. They can be cook with beef slice or shrimp. The mushroom slice look like abalone and feel like abalone but is a vege. \n\nOverall service is great tonight. They have large group there to celebrate Chinese New Year.

The dinner is $30 per person. Please make reservations if you come.  \n\nI would said if you get sick and tired of Chinese buffet that serve you low grade buffet at dinner, this may be your best choice with good quality material selection. They are constantly monitor the buffet table with no man left behind with empty treys :). The hot side include high grade snow crab, bacon wrap fillet mignon, sea bass scampi, pecan crush salmon, Cajun baked scallops and more. The carve have three choices, I like the most is the prime rib. The cold food has too many. I just want to mention the raw oyster since they are big. \n\nThe reason they are 5 stars is due the quality of the buffet, the service to the table, the attentive  to the buffet table, and nice derby lane to look at. If you are handicap, they may let you go through the 5 floor access through kitchen to the buffet table level since this is slope theater seat table. It is funny that you are eating and exercising in the same time with the stair to get the food :)",

This is actually rediscovered restaurant when my wife have a conversation which restaurant has pierogi polish food. \n\nThe restaurant is part serving food restaurant and part grocery store. We follow the recommendations of friend review to order the Two for Thirty dish. This dish come with every combination with sampler of the restaurant menu.  It includes the pierogi, staff cabbage roll, grill pork kielbasa, potato pancake, pork schnitzel, two soups and desserts. It is very good value.  The pork schnitzel is deep fried and top with sauce. That sauce has fragrant smell and I am impressed by the cooking.  \n\nThe soup we have are Borsh and the tripe soup. The Borsh in the red beet broth with small pierogi. The tripe soup is pressure cook and soften. They are delicious for the soup.  The dessert we have are the coconut banana cake and the poppy seed cake. Both of the desserts are super good.  And we have left over to take home.",

They are not hiding or tone down their spiciness because they are in America. I applause to their bravery and stay true on the way of their cuisine suppose to be. \n\nIf you are not daring enough or adventurous, this may not be the restaurant for you. I give them 5 stars because they have define their identity very clearly as good Indian authentic cuisine. The food here definitely match I long for real Indian spice. The chicken tandoori is marinated through and through the bone. The curry certainly stay excellent on the mixture of spice. \n\nIt is buffet style with a lot of veggies option. Many vegetarians dishes are presented here. The price is right for the buffet. I am stuffed but I will be back.",

    "text": "The Royal Street and Bourbon Street are parallel to each other. It is one street south of the Famous Bourbon Street. The Bourbon Street is closed to traffic at night and the Royal Street is closed to vehicular traffic at daytime. Bourbon is a drinking and adult entertainment street. The Royal Street is the opposite. \n\nThe Royal Street has a lot of art Gallery. It includes the Lisa Victoria Art Gallery. This is a court yard gallery with various local artist display their master piece. The night that we have visited have 13 artists display their work. I like Kevin Thayer art. The eye of the women in the painting is attractive. He use the water spray technique that is unique that drip along the paint to create the look. \n\nThe Royal Street is not just the art gallery. The jewel of the street is the street music performance. You will encounter various musicians in different form. You account a pianist play the blue or jazz; Cajun boys in their outback clothing with washboard, spoon, banjos, bucket as drum and a singer well sang; New Orleans jazz band display their funky move while playing the music; someone just sing the old hymn. The best group that we have encounter is a pair up of the electrical violin and the classical acoustic guitar. Both of them accompany each other and have their own solo to showcase their best part. \n\nI like the romantic night stroll at Royal Street compare the crazy party in Bourbon Street.",

They have additional selection for brunch menu not normally serve.\n\nWe got the poke raw with three different raw fish. It come with tamarind curry sauce. It has snow pea, cauliflower rice, cucumber and kimchi. This is my first time try cauliflower rice. Is energy food. I ok with it but my wife love it. \n\nI also got the brunch menu with citrus Ahi tuna poke with pork belly. I like this one better. The pork belly was perfectly fried with right amount of fat and meat. Crunchy and salty. Good mixture. I like citrus sauce over the tamarind curry sauce. The mushrooms was nice and the porch egg was great to break over the poke.",

The interior dinning hall is a beautiful setting with two story high ceiling make the open space very pleasant. They also have the up stair siting which increase the capacity of the restaurant. They have bar with TV for the single dinner or people who wait for the table. Atmosphere is great.\n\nWe have started with the Beef Carpaccio. The thin slice of the beef to be pick up and set on the white truffle and a touch of balsamic vinegar. This is delicious. Our entr\u00e9e are Blacken Atlantic Salmon and Crispy Duck. The salmon serves with spinach and zucchini. I like the lemon butter sauce that accompany the vege. the salmon grill with blacken at top of the salmon that make the taste desirable. Some improvement can be made on how to prepare the blacken side. Like the beef can be cooked for well-medium-rare, the blacken also can be prepared lite spicy-medium-black spicy. This can give the customer a choice of their familiar taste. The crispy duck is definite the go to dish. The duck is debone to only three bone left -wing, two leg bone. This make the dinner easy to consume. The dish serves with mash potato and the duck top with the gravy. The skin is very crispy that make the name of the dish. The duck meat is great and softly prepare. I have try crispy duck with orange sweet sauce, five spice crispy duck, pekin duck. But duck with gravy is first time. We end our evening with champagne raspberry sorbetto. The sorbet is great. By pulling the champagne on top of the sorbet that create the bubble sensation of the taste. The dinner end with creative dessert is making the dinning perfect.\n\nToday we came before 7 PM and they have the entr\u00e9e for the half price. It is a steal. Even after 7 PM, they are also good due to the amount of the food was given. The quality and quantity surely make the chart. The service is perfect for the night. Certainly will be back. They deserve the five star rating for tonight. The half pricing make it to the top.",

This is salmon and Tuna as protein. Including the seaweed and ginger. I like they add extra sauce on the side if you needed. Also extra salsa. The fish is firm and the piece was cut big. They were generous on the protein to create happy customers. Good strategy. Now day we have so many poke place open. This will be good sign for better and more protein. \n\nThe store clerk was very friendly. Definitely will visit them on next time I am in the neighborhood. Enough poke to fill the stomach.

This restaurant has been in the Bay Area for a year and I saw Anna M. has carry out from this sushi restaurant to watch the movie at home. We decided to try her cinema sushi bite. \n\nThis is actually mixed of Korean and Japanese sushi restaurant. Our lunch special is perfect here. We have ordered the Kahlbee lunch box. It came with 4 pieces of California rolls, 3 pieces of sushi (tuna, salmon, and white fish), vegetables tempura, white rice and the main item Kahlbee - the Korean BBQ with short rib. I have been eating many lunch box special with California roll. This one has some Masago (fish egg) on top and makes it nicer. The Korean BBQ is grilled to perfect. The meat is tenderized and they not over grill to charcoal. Perfect meat seasoning. \n\nWe also order the lunch special for additional two rolls with total less than $10. The spicy crunchy tuna and Unakyu Roll (eel roll in eel sauce). I prefer the seaweed to be wrapped outside than inside. The reason is the roll receives crunchy seaweed on the outside than soak and wet to be wrapped inside. The crunch tuna is delicious. They make good use of tiny pieces of tempura chips. Some use the crunchy noodle but I like this restaurant use the tempura chip is more authentic. \n\nThe service is good. The restaurant did give us a special with 3 small Korean appetizers - Kimchi, fish cake, and egg cake. I love them all especially the fish cake. I would recommend for the lunch special and you can try variety of food with affordable price. I also like the combination of Korean food and sushi.",

My grand dog is in the middle which can go to both park. There are some shade umbrellas for dog master to wait for their dog to play.

I have been to this restaurant 5 year ago and it does not give me an impression of good Vietnamese cuisine. \n\nI have read many of my friend review about the pho, it is not the best. Why we revisit. I saw Joel review on the vegan food and decide to try it again. After I have read their menu, we discover the dishes that not normally serve in Pinellas Park Vietnamese hub. You need to navigate to their house special. Tonight we have a dish that we have try in Hanoi and did not see anyone doing it. The chargrilled fish. It is the grill fish \"Thang Long\" style. The fish is marinated with turmeric and baby dill. This dish we found at the street of old town Hanoi. Now we know they have it. \n\nWe also order the autumn roll with fresh roll on grill ground pork. Interesting. We order the the authentic happy pancake with large rice crepe with pork, shrimp and bean sprout. It is very unique. The other dish include traditional Central Vietnam Rice Noodle. This is special noodle of the central Vietnam. That how it got the name. \n\nOverall they are good. I would suggest if you are here, don't try the pho for once. But try their house special menu.",

I like the Tanger sauce they have put over the rice. The use of spice is very similar. It is definitely a recommended restaurant to visit. The few things that I would comment on the restaurant. 1. Employees should use mask during pandemic. 2. Serve real plate instead of styrofoam box for the food if customers dine in. Other than that, they are great restaurant and good service to the local. \n\nWe order two plate from chef special. The first dish is the Le Carnivore. This is the grilled skew steak and chicken. The steak was process and good tender. The chicken has the marinated spice into the meat. The hummus is like soft like the silk. They must take time grind and prepare this hummus. The Morocco shlada or \"salad\" is well prepared. Love it. Our second dish is the mermaid. This is grilled salmon and skew shrimp. This seafood combo dish. The shrimp is large and the fish is good. \n\nOur appetizer is one of the best falafel. The coating is fried to crispy. The inside is still green. Similar to the falafel in Morocco.

This restaurant do not specific has one but able to manage the reservation and scheduling. Does mean they don't have one but integrated the system in the waitress. They also don't need one floor manager which is effective. Not second hand sit around worker. Very efficient. Big applause to the restaurant with good business model. \n\nThe food. Mmmmm good. Very good and reasonable pricing. We have order the Szechwan Cracked Peppercorn and Garlic Steak and the Shrimp Lo Mein. The shrimp Lo Mein is good but the steak is better. The steak is NY Strip with their spice rub and finished on the grill. Then it the sauce with pan fry garlic is added on the steak. Well balance on the taste. Steak is cooked to your order. \n\nThe service is well train on the table side manner waitress. Pay attention to the detail of how to serve. Am I coming back- a big yes.

It is difficult to visit this restaurant during weekday and you are 30 miles away. Finally we have a chance to visit. The restaurant space is small. So either you have the take out or visit them at odd hour like 2 pm after lunch hour. Because they always jam pack. \n\nOur first course is the 11 chick bowl. Great flavors. However I like the second dish with chick # 8 the Paisa. This arepa has fried egg, marinated beef, plantain, chorizo, avocado. Best combination. I like marinated beef inside. Great meal. Our last dish is sweet corn arepa with saut\u00e9ed shrimp. The shrimp size is big and worth the money. \n\nWe got the cappuccino top cinnamon powder. Great thick drinks. The rating is 5 due to great pricing, great food, and tasty.",

We notice the chef is not Korean and they did a good job. \n\nWe started with kimchi pancake. Normal Korean restaurant serve this dis in pie shape. They charge to triangle piece. I actually like their method because easy to bite and enable to fried on all corner of the pancake. My next dish is the beef bulgogi. This sizzling dish has good marinated sauce. I also like the banchan that go with it. It they can expand the number of banchan will be better. \n\nService is ok. On point. The food is impressive. It is good concept to have small menu but do well on it.",

They serve from noodle dish to sushi stack. Don't miss their lunch special. It is a steal. \n\nThe lunch special has selection from one protein to 3 protein. Protein range from sashimi to chicken katsu. The side included sushi roll to house salad. \n\nWe start with onigiri with spicy tuna and salmon avocado. I like the flavor mixed in. Our next dish tapas sample for two. This tapas dish include tempura shrimp and veggies, seaweed salad, squid salad, chicken pot stickers. Very much sample the appetizers. Our last dish is duck ramen soup. It is quite unique. The roasted duck lay on top of the ramen. The soup base is excellent and tasty. Definitely recommend this dish. \n\nThis restaurant service is good. Definitely will visit again. It is also reasonable in price.",

It was fun to see who like it, who cannot stand the smell or who cannot take the durian straight. \n\nDurian is king of the fruit in Asia. It look very pointy at outside. To open it, find the point of crust tip and hit it the ground to crack it open slightly. Than you can peel break it. Or use screw driver penetrate to the tip and pry it open. \n\nSome said this fruit look like the poop and some said is a golden nuggets. This fruit is either you like it or stay away of it. When fruit ripe correctly, it has an alcohol sweet taste. The sweetness is one of the kind that you cannot imagine. \n\nIf you have durian at home, the people who visited your home will know that since the aroma of the smell will occupy the air space of your home. When the gardener or planter walk under the durian tree, they need to wear a helmet. The ripe durian actually fall to ground and that is the signed ready to eat. You don't pick durian from the tree. You wait until it fall to ground.",

The restaurant is not ready yet. Public skate is started. \n\nThe facility has four big ice rinks and one small skill set rinks. One of the big ice rink (Rink D) has 400 seat for audiences. This not typical mall skating rink which is not gear for ice hockey. The big rinks are equipped to NHL standards. \n\nTip. Since they just open, all the figure skate rentals shoes are stiff on the fabric. Because all the rental skates are new and the fabric has not been worn and expanded. I have to go two shoe sizes up to feel comfortable. \n\nThe best deal is to find four people go with you. Family pack of 4 with skate rentals is $40. Good deal. Addition people after that is $10. \n\nSome of the dry court actually can convert to basketball. They have indicated curling will be part of the facility and this will be introduced to the public. Excited. Never done curling before.",

    "text": "I enjoy my time in Grey Salt with friend and family. This restaurant is newly added restaurant with beautiful interior design. All the interior decoration has a smooth line of comfort. Compare to many restaurants in hard rock, I will chose this restaurant for the best of value if you paid for the food your own without gambling complementary of the hotel. \n\nIs the food in grey area. Certainly not. In fact, it is a good use of salt with the mixture of ingredients. Tonight we start our night with the appetizers and soup. We have the roasted octopus with two large tentacles. They were roasted a bit charcoal but they are marinated nicely. It serves over the garlic roasted small potatoes. The second appetizer is the roasted oysters lay over the crouton. The oysters was top with garlic and parsley then roasted. Yum yum. The soup of the day have some of the oysters and crunchy enhance item. It serves over bean base creamy soup over the light chili oil. It is a nice soup to have. \n\nMy entr\u00e9e is the wood grilled prime skirt steak. The skirt steak is almost like churrasco but is has good balance of seasoning. The meat is soft and tender. It top over ash roasted carrots. This is very good carrots. If you going to order the extra side, the carrot is the one to choose. \n\nSince the octopus is a bit charcoal on the exterior, the restaurant is nice enough to give us complementary desserts. I have the creme catalania which very similar to creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e. The difference is instead torch the sugar of the top with open flame, they use heat iron mold to caramelized the sugar. You can request the chef to demonstrate how the caramelize is done. It is quite a show. \n\nOverall this restaurant is 4.5 stars. The half stars is due to some of the main entree is not a wow factor. Since the service is very good and attentive, they deserve 5 stars. If you like to have a nice dinner but not over price, this will be good choice.",

Although they are not like ancient time but it offers a lot souvenir, food, hand craft, art, jewelry, drink, restaurant for the tourist. This is a fun place to be if you are looking for bargain souvenir. If you like the vender street food, this is a place to be. \n\nThe market is open air market. Please be aware of the temperature since it is close to Mississippi River and will catch a lot of wind drift in cold weather. The restroom is pack with tourist during the Mardi Gras season. I would advise you to take the restroom at old US Mint. When they are open, they have the cleaner restroom for the ladies. It is just across the street at the end of market. No line!!!!! \n\nThe vendor of art varies from many things. It ranges from clothing to front car display plate. During Mardi Gras season, the venders also located open sky concrete pad area. There are fantastic hand craft.\n\nPlease try their street food like fried cone or roast cone. These may be a must try item and they located at Mother Nature's Cupboard. Some of the venders sell crepe on the order, oyster and crawfish. Looking for special artist item such as one of the artists can bend the wire in different color to make a ring that can fit your exact ring finger size. My wife got a Mardi Gras color ring that is very unique.  \n\nSome of the venders show up after 10 am. And that is the time the tourist show up also.",

I remember every time he handed the RX to me, he always explains to me number pills need, after of before the meal, what should not go with pills, best time to take it, any of my questions.

    "text": "This will be marked my end of double digit review (review 99). I will start my review by simply saying::great restaurant. Every time we pass by there is a line outside. The wait for dinner is 1 hour average. They don't take reservation. The best way to get to the restaurant is during their opening and during parade. We have found a trick to get to this restaurant. YELP has indicated the restaurant open at 11:00 am, they are actually open at 10:30. I am using this advantage to beat the crowd by 10 minutes to get a seat.    \n\nToday lunch we have ordered the chargrilled oysters, fried crab craw, fried crawfish tail. The chargrilled oysters are season with garlic and salted and cook over the open flame. After you have eaten the oyster, you can dip the bread into the half shell to pick up the remaining seasoning sauce on the shell. Mmmm it is very good. The oysters here are better than the one we have in Florida. They are fresh and big. Somehow the swamp water breeds a better oyster. The fried crawfish tail is great to go with the beer. The fried blue crab craws are much better in this case. It is heavenly good. We were joking may be order to go order and sell with double price for the people who are waiting hour in line. \n\nSince they are open for lunch at 10:30 am, it is consider brunch. You actually can skip the breakfast at Cafe du Monde and come here for better food experience. I have pick this restaurant to be one of the best in New Orleans to close my double digit review.",

During the Tampa Japanese Summer Festival, their truck is one of the food truck show up. \n\nTheir menu is simple, Kaarage $10, Chicken Teriyaki $8, Okonomi Tot $10, and the Gyudon for $11. All this is actually Japanese street food. I am appreciate they try to change their cuisine just for the festival. In fact, those dishes is quite good and colorful display. We got the Kaarage. This dish is chicken marinated in sake and soy sauce then deep fried with coating. They are quite good. The accompanying slaw also good. What a treat. It come with 5 big pieces chicken. \n\nThe order to wait for the food is less than 5 minutes. They have enough man power for the food preparation.",

All of that. \n\nThey have the gelato and ice cream section. I would go to the gelato because they are more interesting. We taste many flavor. I got the banana foster and bourbon gelato. This two flavors is excellent taste and not find elsewhere. Then you can choose the type of make up or just regular cone. For the experience, I would go for the makeup cone they have. We got the clown cone. This is with cotton candy. We take a part and eat those separately. \n\nBy the way, extra scoop is only a dollar more. The clown cone is $7 and extra scoop make it to the $8. Not cheap, but they give good quantity of gelato to make up the price.",

I was not going to have the high expectations. They have very good lunch special Monday to Friday. Approximately $9. Great deal. \n\nI did not go for the lunch special and go straight to one of their best dish. The cuisine is very similar to Black Forrest Germany cuisine when I have visited the Germany. I got the Schweinshax'n (pork Shank). It come with sauerkraut and bread dumplings. The sauerkraut was excellent. The dumplings is interesting that come as a cake pieces. \n\nThe shank is braise and over roasted. They have lite seasoning outwardly. It is a big chunk. Great for hungry people.

Byblos has these technique in high standard. I have the lamb chop and my wife has a mixed grilled. The lamb is the bone in lamb that is well cut and perfectly grilled. The marinated spice is well deep into the meat. This dish is my favorite. My wife have the mixed grilled. They are good also. But after you have the lamb, you will feel the lamb is more superior than the sheik kabab. \n\nThe room is well decorated. Each room has it own character. The outside sitting include fire pit you can grilled you own. The interior include formal dining hall, bar area, private drape room. \n\nThe service is good during lunch time.

    "text": "Mad scientist or creative chef. Do you have to decide the final outcome for the food lab. It is actually experiment food?  Mmmm. Let see the dinner out come. We have our company holiday dinner there with design menu. It is not cheap but very worth for the trip. \n\nOur request menu is a four course night with starting the cold appetizers at the first plate. My wife have the almond coconut gazpacho - it is coconut rock shrimp with Fuji Apple salpicon in green curry oil. This a cold soup. The rock shrimp is nice and creative in the soup. The soup base is not normal gazpacho and is white. It is good. I have the avocado leaf seated yellow fin tuna. This is the best of the cold app. It come green mango salad, aji amarillo sorbet, fish sauce caramel and tamarind peanut crunch. It creative that the sorbet replace the wasabi and the fish sauce caramel replace the balsamic reduction sauce. Now you know why they call themselves food lab. \n\nThe second course are the hot appetizers. I have smoked maple glazed pork belly. It top with hoe cake, black eyed peas, green tomato chow-chow. Usually I don't care about hoe cake but sauce and other ingredients combine, it is great. The pork belly is cook perfectly. If you are not good chef, do not try this dish because it need three part meat harmony. My wife has Serrano ham zeppole. The slice hams were place on top of rosemary doughnuts with compressed melon, Saba and Parmesan snow. Interesting dish. The rosemary was deep fried to crispy with seasoning. I have not have it this way before. \n\nOur third course are the main dishes. I have the red snapper a la plancha. It is fillets snapper with saut\u00e9ed and glazed on top on avocado coconut grits, baby spinach, mergers marmalade, avocado chutney and mango harissa pur\u00e9e. This best main dish tonight the pur\u00e9e go very well with the fish. My wife has the painted hills short rib 'sancocho'. Usually the Caribbean sancocho is a mix of meat and veggies soup. This is an overhaul design for the short rib with boniato, yuca, sweet potato, and sweet corn, green plantain,avocado toss watercress, and cilantro sweet garlic juice. I only can said - it is good. \n\nThe final course is the sugar crusted butter cake or chocolate peanut butter bar. Both of them is great. I the butter cake because the cake form the caramelized sugar crust on all expose wall. The cake is syrup and is good. \n\nThe only thing is the food take a bit time to come out for the first dish. The rest are good. The service is great. The drink you have to refer to the pic since we don't know what they have created.",

    "text": "This restaurant locate at downtown St. Pete close to the museum of fine art. Since this is a Thursday night with museum special deal after 5 pm ($5 per adult, normal $17), after museum, we decide to come to this restaurant. \n\nThe store front is a open bar. The time we were there is about six and they can sit you immediately. After 30 minutes, there is already a waiting line. Please come before six if you don't want to wait for sit. Bella already extend their sitting area with capacity, however if you are late, you will need to wait.  Among all the restaurant at downtown, they are the most reason in price for the food. \n\nToday I order the menu with \"secondi\" category - marinated skirt steak and my wife order the grilled chicken pasta. The item in the \"secondi\" came with soup of the day or salad. This is better deal. The $22 skirt steak came with two side and a soup. Good deal. The soup of the day is minestrone sausage soup. It is bean base, dice tomatoes, dice carrot, and chop pasta in crush tomatoes base. I believe they have added the oregano and basil to enhance the flavor. It make the soup well balance and interesting. \n\nThe skirt steak is marinated with sweet sauce and serve with mash potatoes and grill broccolini. The broccolini is very impress. They broil, grill and stir fry in the process with garlic sauce with a hint of spicy chili. This make the food sophisticate. The skirt steak is grill to your order and slice to the bite size. \n\nThe whole proceed of serving is ok. It is slow in the beginning but it pick up at the end. The extend area may be good for company Christmas party. It deserve for full stars due to to chef cooking skill, service, clean bath room and good pricing.",

I am staring with the host of the place Maestro's at the Starz Center. They have many to offer with their staff chefs. I am sure they can create something new each day. The restaurants in my list tonight are Miguel's Mexican Grill, Queen of Sheba Ethiopian Restaurant, Aqua, Saddle Brook Resort, Chart House Tampa, WaterWorks Bar and Grill, Bar 700 Holidays Inn Westshore, Colombia Restaurant, and Timpano Chophouse. And my most favorite of the night is the Oyster Catcher. These are the restaurants in my list to visit. I like to thanks the Ducky's ladies took a picture with me and I may visit them one day. The only bad thing about this event is too many standing. \n\nAfter 9:30 pm, most of the people is start staying away from the food and move to the party on the river front. Tonight is a bit hot but it does not stop us from dancing. Many ladies of the night challenge Nick for a dance off. Rachel also get to one of the stage and dance. What a fun night to be.",

It look pretty. The roll ice cream is delicious. My wife got the King Samoa. This is a Nutella and caramel syrup. It has coconut flake and crackers in it. Lovely roll ice cream.

This is choice 3 item combination with bananas leave fish, pork jerky, and the pork sausage. This great dish to have and try three different street food. \n\nOur next dish is the Kow Poun Gai - Laos Noodle soup. This is tapioca noodle with chicken. It is delicious. Our last dish is the Frog Leg Khoua Pik. This is frog leg stir fry with Laos chili paste. I like this dish. We also have the Laos chili chicken wing. Those are really good. \n\nOur experience here is great. Love the place. The only thing is the menu ingredients do not reflect what they serve. They only serve available ingredients. So sometimes you don't get all the ingredients they have mentioned in the menu.",

Bern definitely is well know outside of Tampa that make him to choose this restaurant. \n\nI have been to Bern for several occasions. One time is by my own and many time are power dinner with the clients. Since then, I have not been back for about five years. Since then, they value of the meal has changed to better. Before it, the side is paid as a la carte. Now they include as part of the meal. It make the value of the dinning improve. \n\nWe were seated at the Bronze Room. I like open room with bronze statues on the wall. It is elegantly decorated. We order the 14 oz chateaubriand for two and a chop steak. Each meal come with onion soup, salad with dressing of your choice, fried onions, zucchini and carrot. The French onion soup is amazing. \n\nMy steak was perfectly grilled. I would said if you come here, chateaubriand is the way to order your steak. No other place do better than here. The chop steak is well presented over the mash potatoes. I like the waiter prepare the whole potato to added all ingredients on it including the bacon bite. \n\nAfter the dinner, it was a pleasure to visit their kitchen and the cellar. I saw many famous post of pictures are in this cellar. The dessert room is like a maze. We have the taste of the Bern with five Bern's signature desserts. I like the King Midas and the banana cheese pie. \n\nEverything is good here.

    "text": "Agree with Mark for the tasty food and fast service. I think it is more like 4.5 stars restaurant then actual 5 stars. I wonder why they have to be located at Soho area, why don't they locate near USF area to attract more students and the Busch Garden tourist. Soho already has so many restaurants, I think their pricing is good for the students. \n\nI will start with their side selection. They have several selection I like. The roasted vegetables, braised white bean and Greek salad is good. For the Greek salad selection is free with kabab. Other combinations need to add $1.69. Tonight we have the steak and salmon kabab. Both of them is flavorful. The steak is in sweet marinated sauce. The reason they get half stars less due to the meat quality,  it is chewy. The salmon was perfect. It come with zucchini in the skew and the salmon juice dip into the zucchini and make it more sophisticated. \n\nThe price is right. I like they use the actual silver ware instead of plastic ware. The place is typical fast food. Definitely will be back.",

    "text": "The super bowl night and we decide to sit at the bar side of the Bonefish Grilled.  The new added menu for the Bar Bites Menu has added another dimension for the order. The items start at $4 to $12. The bar bites menu have 8 selection and some of the selection have two different type of meat. The appetizer has 11 items to select. The combination of the bar menu and the appetizer create over twenty different selection. This is good business model with Tapas mentality that the bonefish management has provided the customer with more choice. It definite makes the top bar in this area. It will attract more customer in the future.\n\nTonight we started with the Lamb Lollipop hops. I have this dish at different Bonefish location and I want to make sure different chef can create this dish better. The lamb chop turns up better at this location. The meat is cook to perfect medium and have hint of salt to make the chop taste better without losing it meat taste. We have order the Lobster Street Taco. My wife like this dish and said it have big chunk of lobster meat and worth the $5 item. We have order a bowl of the corn chowder with crab meat. I will advice you order the bowl instead of the cup when you are hungry or two people in the party that can share this dish. The cup and bowl size only a $1 different and you get more on the bowl. We have gone to the appetizer menu and order the Filet Satay. This is new item in the appetizer. It is a center cut filet mignon in soy seasoning and serves with spicy mustard sauce in tomatoes, cucumber, onion.  The meat is tender and soft. The only down side is each pieces is small. However they are delicious. The next appetizer is Singapore Calamari. The calamari is lightly dry pepper breaded and deep fried. It serves sweet spicy sauce. They are crispy and we have left nothing on the plate because they are insane good. The last item is the coconut shrimp with sweet spicy sauce. The dish has six jumbo shrimp and coated with coconut flake. This is a good value dish and it is less than $9. \n\nWe are stuff after all the items. I forgot to mention the Sunday night have happy hours till 6:30. The wine is $3.25 a glass and the draft beer is a dollar. Can't beat that!!! Our server is super nice and attentive. As a result, tonight we are awarding this restaurant with 5 stars.",

It is one of the kind in Tampa Bay Area. You have to experience it for it wonderful cuisine. The restaurant locates near USF which make sense for many Russian students study there. The day we have visited, not many customers. It need great word of mouth to spread a good news. \n\nThe menu is simple and delicious. The display in the restaurant is nice with Russian doll. They have the bakery good next to the counter. The only thing I would complain is the chair is too tight. \n\nWhat is meaning of \"Babushka\". It mean triangular folded kerchief for head or it also mean grandmother. Many Russian doll has kerchief over it is part of long tradition. It also can mean your grandma kitchen. Take your pick. \n\nOur first dish we have order is the Borscht. This is a famous soup with meat, saut\u00e9ed veggies and beet root. The beet make the entire soup red color. The soup is great during winter. It top with the rosemary. The second dish is Blinchiki. This is a tradition wheat crepe wrap the meat inside. Very unique in many way. \n\nOur third dish is the Russian dumplings. They have three different fillings inside the dumplings. The Lamb, Beef and Pork. We mixed the pork and beef with the soup base. I like the most is the pork. I would suggest order with soup options. The fourth dish is the Syrniki. This is a pancake made from cheese and wrap with meat options. I like this one too. \n\nOur fifth and final dish is the Kotlety. It is three minced meat croquettes with a side. We have chose Russian brown rice\n\nOverall our experience have exceed our expectations. It was marvelous meal we have at the dinner. It deserves a 5 stars attention. I would said you may need to change your taste bud when you come to this place. Many items is less sodium. But the taste still there. Russian like to use the sour cream. But I don't.",

    "text": "This is the fourth time I am here. This is the first time we have seen full restaurant capacity. Please reserve ahead to get good seat. Tonight is the first Saturday of the month and they have the flamenco show and is free to the diner. This is happen every first Saturday of the month. The show is perform by a husband and wife team. The beautiful flamenco is performed by his wife Esther Suarez. She wears a tradition flamenco dress with fire lighting foot step pounding to stage floor. The husband Victor Moreno performing the Spanish guitar and the Spanish song that attract our attention and pleasant to the ear. The combination of song and dance entertainment make the night unforgettable.  \n\nTonight we have started with the appetizer we love the most the lamb chop and follow by the mussel. The lamb chop is prepared by cutting the meat to rib bone and grilled to the perfection. The ingredient do not have the lamb smell at all. It is bite size happiness. The mussel is cook in garlic wine sauce. I have finish the garlic sauce with the dip of dinner roll. Mmmm good. \n\nToday we order a bottle Black Sheep French Cabernet Sauvignon $24 a good value same as whole sale price. We have pair with our entree tonight. We have the New York Strip steak with mushroom wine sauce. The meat is prepare with the perfect wine sauce that go with the grilled steak. It came with broccoli. The other entree is Banger and Mash. It is the the English Sausage and the mash potato. The English sausage is insane delicious. It is better than the German sausage. Tasty!!!  The mash potato is mix with garlic sauce and spice. It is good that we have nothing left in the plate. \n\nThis restaurant owner wife is the main chef. You will enjoy every creation of her dish. We close out the dinner with the dessert crumble. Sweet fruit in the crunchy topping and top with vanilla ice cream. \n\nTo night is perfect that we finish with the flamenco performance with live Spanish song. The flamenco dancer pound the floor and vibrate the noise and vibrate your heart. The slow motion of the flamenco dancer express the beautiful ancient art. The rhythm\nis great to go with the dance every move. Can said that better, you have to experience yourself by every first Saturday of the month. \n\nOverall this is great place to be. Some family bring their children to experience the live show.",

    "text": "Our revisit is great. The service and the waiter are very responsive. Tonight we have a chance to try variety of food. We already know this restaurant have good skill. But tonight they are better. We have finally try their Peking duck. This dish needs to be pre-ordered a day or two before you come here. They will not serve you this dish if you just walking to the restaurant. \n\nWhat is really the Peking duck? In the Yuan dynasty many variety of the roast duck has been done. Until the Ming dynasty the Peking Roast Duck is fully developed. This dish is serve to many diplomats who visit China. Henry Kissinger may be the first diplomat from US who lay the road for Richard Nixon have the first invite on this dish. \n\nThis duck preparation is closely guarded recipes in Peking. For my limited understanding the duck is dressed with the sauce and hung dry for two days before it roast in the oven. This allows the sauce marinated into the skin and duck meat. Because it was hung dry the skin is easily separated. Our dish tonight have display the best skin and meat separation. Meat is very lean. It serve with bun with hoisin sauce and scallions. Yummy good. \n\nMany will said may be Valrico may have good food but is too far to try their restaurant. I would said this is two of the restaurant in this area worth for a drive. I would suggest you pre-order the Peking duck before you come.",

    "text": "The TECO (Tampa Electric Company) Manatee Viewing center is a place to be when the outside temperature high of the day is below 68 degree. There is when the manatees gather at the warm water. Florida Manatee which is the West Indian manatee is very gracious creature in the water. The Manatee is found at many natural spring that maintain 72 degree of the temperature water. The sailor from the old time has mistaken them as mermaid of the sea.\n\nThere is no surprise at this time of year, the manatees are gathering near the TECO power plans that discharge their cooling water into the gulf. TECO using the water to cool their power plants and discharge the high temperature water into the Big Bend Bay of the gulf. As a result the water near the power plants was raise to 78 degree that attracts the manatee to reside near the bay. Today we are seeing over 150 manatees that gather at this place by their nature instinct. Although there is requirement from the EPA restriction of the clean water and air discharge, TECO has used this opportunity for the public relation to provide a center of the refuge for the manatee and the curious tourist. With the combination of the volunteer and partner of the TECO, this is a place to be visited when you come to Tampa bay at the cooling time. Today we spot a baby manatee that scratches his face with it three nail fin which is very adorable. Who can ague to the face of the manatee when they look at you? You can see some of the manatee back was hit by the boater. This remind us at the no wake zone the boater needs to slow down and respect the animal.\n\nThe center has included the bay walk elevated above the Big Bend Bay. It also has the observation tower at the nature trail. The parking may be a challenge if you come late, and you have to park at the overflow lot is half miles away. Come before 10 am is the best time if you want to park your car closer.",

We are welcome the cold serve in Florida since we have hot weather most of the time. \n\nI like thank Nick to show this place to us. We like their combination of the Italian ice with the soft serve ice cream. This combination is work for me. I have the vanilla soft serve with the bubble gum flavor Italian ice. They put them in layer. We actually can pick to flavors of Italian ice but I didn't do it since I like bubble gum flavor. The ice cream with the two type of mix calls gelati. I like Mr. Penguin creative bring other sensation to the community. \n\nThe soft serve can be vanilla, chocolate or the swirl of two flavors. The Italian ice has a lot to select. You can ask for the try out taste before you make your order. This place is dog friendly.",

    "text": "My final farewell to the restaurant owner and chef for their retirement of this restaurant was last night dinner. After 21 year of long running, the Cafe European will close their restaurant. The last night of dinner will be 8/1/2015. After that it will be close\n\nI met the new owners of the restaurant there too.  They have not decided what they going to do yet but will open a different restaurant. The new restaurant will be different than the existing restaurant. \n\nThanks to Suzy and Mike for choosing Tampa for 21 years. This is the restaurant I love and the farewell is last night dinner. They have one more night which is tonight. For 6 years we have get to know about their restaurant, we enjoy Suzy delicates chef skill. You will not find a British who can cook like this in town. The best dish is the Beef Wellington that with the puffy dough and seasoning red wine sauce and mushroom is the best in town. If you watch Gordon Ramsay Hell Kitchen show, he always test the young chef for this dish. Difficult dish to cook and make harmony of two worlds. I like their lamp chop appetizer is one of the best in town. Very consistent every time we're here. \n\nI wish them very good journey of their break from restaurant business. Farewell my friends.",

    "text": "Great Chinese restaurant. The old ABC was located at St. Pete and now the the owner move to this location not long ago. When they just first open I was not impress. Today they are really do a good job. \n\nWe have order a salt and pepper Whole Lobster and three dim sum dishes for dinner. The dim sum are shrimp stuff egg plant, leak steam dumpling and the beef tripe. The egg plant is well prepared since the skin is soft enough. Obviously the egg plant is deep fried with ground shrimp paste and hot plate grilled the surface and added the black beam sauce. If the chef did not prepare correctly the skin will be tough to bite through and you will end up leave the skin on the side. However this chef did correctly and is yum to consume. \n\nToday feature is the the Lobster. They are running the special with each lobster $15. Can't beat this price. They can prepare ginger scallion, Hong Kong style with egg white, steam, salt and pepper.......\nYou got to try it now while they are running the special. The way they have the lobster cut to 10 pieces. The first cut is remove head then the crawl. The body is cut to 6 pieces. They will deep fried and stir fry with salt, green scallion, onion and jalape\u00f1o. This dish you need to learn how to eat from the shell. \n\nIf you have group 4 or more, I recommend to order the fillet flounder. The fish meat fillet in cube and easy to eat. Many people don't know the fried side bone can be eaten. The side bone is taste like crunchy yum food. Please be sure to chew or crush before you swallow because some time you chose too close to the main bone that cannot be swallow.  \n\nOverall the service is good today. We have been back and will be back for more.",

This is the perfect academic and restaurant to close my 300th series review. Thanks to students and teacher who serve the good food. If you like to know the website to joint in, please go to Grace H review. \n\nWe have a pleasure to celebrate a friend be late birthday here. The setting is nice with beautiful art on the wall. It is a table cloth serving if you want to have a nice diner with your love one with very good cost. I would encourage put more tip money in the plate to support the scholarship for the school since they are not for profit. Come and try out their food since each week is different country until their semester ended of their serving. \n\nTonight we have the Greek theme since I miss the season opener last week. The first course is the Greek Salad and The Lentil Soup. The Greek salad is a classic dish in many Greek restaurant. I like the pita bread on top of the salad. It is crispy and top with few pieces of sea salt. The lentil soup is garnish with spinach. The flavor has a twist mixture of the fragrant of food. \n\nThe main course is the Pork Tenderloin serves with Orzo Pasta. The orzo pasta shape like rice cook with olive oil tomato with a bit basil leave. The pork tenderloin is seasoned and baked in oven. The exterior was well salt and the seasoning that went into the meat.  Then it is sliced and served to the customer.  \n\nMy favorite is the dessert. Tonight it end with Baklava. I have eat many of baklava and never like it because many of them are sitting too long or wrap in the plastic before it serve. The different of this baklava is freshly prepared with crispy layers of crush. The infill of nuts are crispy and perfect to enjoy. \n\nThey still have four weeks left before the semester run out. Come and try the good cooking and support the students.",

    "text": "I like the mixture of this restaurant. I have been here several time and they have not disappoint me. The service is great and the owner of the restaurant paid attention to the customer. She get in sushi wrap if they are behind. She gets to the front serving the table if they need help in this area. I like mom and pop shop like this and the yelper need to support them to stay alive. \n\nThis is a restaurant that is great for vegan or regular eater customer. Most of of the people don't know there is a vegetarian menu. You have to ask for the vege menu that not shown often. In the vege menu they have a roll call the funky monkey roll. It is a bit sweet and go well spicy tuna roll. It neutralizes the spiciness. What is actually the Funky Monkey Roll??  This is a vegan dish and they are pretty good. It is Inari (sweet tofu skin), avocado, cucumber, daikon, and tempura banana, rolled in seaweed and rice, topped with mango and avocado. These are complicated combination and they are working well with each material. \n\nI always use the spicy tuna roll as a judgment for the sushi chef skill. Some sushi chef likes to add chop of cucumber in the roll. This is incorrect and it is occupied the actual tuna space and reduce the amount of tuna provided. The correct way is to dice the tuna not ground and then add quail egg. Then add sesame oil, spicy chili, a bit salt and roll with the sushi rice. This roll not requires and soy sauce or wasabi and it is good enough to eat as it is. This restaurant did it A+. \n\nI have order the Japanese Ramen with pork belly. They did not make me jump out the seat but is good enough to enjoy. Today I have order the Chashu Pork Belly Ramen - Served with chashu pork belly, pork pot stickers, boiled eggs, corn, scallions, naruto (pink spiral fish cake) and menma (pickled bamboo shoots)\n\nWe have close our lunch with a desert is big enough to share for 4 people. It is the Banana Bomb - Tempura fried banana & dark chocolate wrapped in spring roll skin served with vanilla ice cream & assorted sauces. The display is a wow factor and it also taste like a wow factor. Love it.\n\nThursday and Saturday night have dates night special. Please check their web site. If you check in with Yelp, you get a free shot of sake. The best is the sake came with flavor. I like the Fuji Apple flavor.",

    "text": "Yelping 1900. Authentic Cultural Food No. 47. Center East Chinese Cuisine\n\nThis restaurant use to call Tao Asian Fusion. Recently has changed their name. The menu is also changed. This restaurant basically has Shandong and Peking cuisine. Very close to Szechuan cuisine. This area of China eat slightly different from other side of country. Since it is at the capital, the cuisine includes many area of China due to dynasty dining. \n\nI like many items in the menu and the special of the day. It has an attractive menu. We got the saut\u00e9ed pig kidney. The chef is skillful not to let the ingredients over cook. It is nice to see to serve this dish right. Our next dish is the beef noodle with pickle veggies. The beef is marinated and braised for some time. \n\nWe also got the fish with black bean sauce. This black bean sauce with chili is a nice combination. The fish is fried with whole fish no head. So you need to skill eater to order this dish. Our last entree is the Dong Po Pork. I love this dish when they prepared correctly. This is Pork belly with skin and braised in sweet sauce. It need to be braised over time to soften the tough skin and meat. Which they have done that. I would recommend this dish if you come to visit. \n\nWe order the beef pie from the special menu. It is special street food category. If they carry this dish. Order the pork pie. Overall experience is excellent. Enjoy the good cooking. We have been back twice.",

    "text": "4.5 stars restaurant. Not yet 5 stars to my book. This restaurant has plus at back of the name. This mean they beyond just poke only. The restaurant also has the Vietnamese cuisine. So you can get poke and cook meal. I got best of both worlds. \n\nI start with mixed poke. I got the base as rice and protein as tuna. They are generous for one scoop of protein. This is why they have 5 stars. I got all the mixed in ingredients and topping that have have no up charge. The sauce are poke sauce, eel and special ask for sesame oil. It was really good for mixed in. I would pre them to do mixed in ingredients and protein separately than added into the base then add topping. But they don't have this procedure. They do put the sauce over base then on top of mixed in ingredients. This area they can improve. \n\nWe also got the combination pho and grilled pork bun. Their Vietnamese side food also delicious. The grilled pork is well marinated and their pho is deep with herb smell.",

I think your restaurant has good high ceiling dining hall. No doubt the great Brazilian Grille in Tampa Bay Area. We were lucky to have you. Interior design is great. Good place for power lunch and bring the the client. \n\nWith that said. This is place for meat. Love it. Buffet style. People may be afraid of close contact because of buffet. Thank you to make it safer for people come to the table. Before each individual come to the buffet booth, each one need to put on the hand gloves. So the share spatula is not touch. The buffet table already have partial cover on top. But I think more cover or complete lid cover is better. We saw a few completely cover such as soup item is very good. \n\nThe meat bring to the table is well perform. Server wear gloves and mask. Definitely great to visit. Keep serving our community and we are looking forward to see you again.",

The all you can eat steak also includes all you can eat buffet for other miscellaneous items. \n\nThe steak is awesome. Especially I like the lamb chop, chicken heart, skirt steak, top sirloin. All steak is well seasoning. Especially the chicken heart and chicken drum stick. The chicken drum stick is marinated in wine sauce. Very delicious. There are wave and wave of meat to cut. They also bring out big giant leg of lamb. \n\nDuring this time on the brand new opening, they have 10% off the bill. On the buffet table, they have heart of palm, Smoke salmon, caramel mushrooms and more. \n\nTip - don't forget to ask for the steak sauce such chimichuri, hot sauce, mint jelly to go with steak and lamb chop. \n\nService is excellent. These include the speed, attention to detail, clean up, and frequently check on the table. Definitely 5 stars.",

This restaurant now is my number one store to go finger food for crab. It is king of the crab store. Best ever. If you want some finger food during this football season, this will be the one if you don't mind to get down dirty with finger for limited crab meat. \n\nToday I got two types of crab. The garlic crab and fried crab. Both of them are excellently exceedingly my expectations. The garlic crabs are finger licking good. 3 crab for $7.50. I also got the seasoning fried crab for $11. Man!!! Those are good. The seasoning is deeeeeeeeep into the crab since the crab is minorly crack to allow the seasoning get into the crab meat. They have other item. But I think you should concentrate on the crabs. \n\nAm I coming back. Hell yes!!!! Love the food. By the way this is just a take out store. You can order 15 minutes ahead so it won't be any wait. The crab is fresh. The fried crab is normally bigger than garlic crab. There is not sit down area. Only carry out.",

    "text": "One of my best restaurant list in the Bay Area. I have been to this place many time and decide to give the a full review. The restaurant originally start at the Water Ave Armenia location. Then they build the Bistro at this location (Hillsborough Ave). Then they have open the Gainesville and Sarasota. I have been to all of them except the newly open restaurant in Ocala. \n\nThey have consistence tasting through out these locations. Tonight we have long distance friend visit us and we decide to take them here. Since tonight is January 1 no reservation. Usually the weekend and holiday they don't take reservation. We have waited 30 minute for our table. We have order the sizzling ginger scallion frog leg, crab and fish maw soup, steam snapper with ginger and soy source, duck raisin fried rice and the grouper egg plant hot pot and the appetizer of scallop in salt and pepper. The salt and pepper scallop is wet coated with flour and deep fry then stir fry with Garlic, pepper and salt. They did not over coat the ingredient and make the scallop soft inside. This is a delicious appetizer. \n\nWe have the main dishes of the raisin duck fried rice. The duck is roasted and the meat is chop in small pieces and stir fry with raisin, egg and long grain rice. The fry rice is fantastic. The egg and fish maw soup has make a good use of ingredient to create the flavor of the soup. Add an hint of red vinegar and white pepper, it will enhance the taste. The sizzling fog leg is a bit down today. The frog leg is coated and deep fried. However the chef make the coating too thick today. Usually they are good thin coating to keep the leg meat intact and stir fry with ginger and scallion source. The steam fish is perfect with fresh snapper and ginger in soy source and sesame oil. We have two pounder fish. We also have the egg plant and grouper hot pot. The egg plant is cook in the fish source and use the hot pot to braise and soften the egg plant fiber. The mix of grouper the the egg plant is a pleasant dish to eat. \n\nOverall we are very satisfy with our meal and service. I wish they allow reservation to make the the restaurant more attractive.",

We were here for the dinner. The interior is nice with wide open dining hall. One thing can improve is the seat cushion of the booth need to resurface because when we seat, the seat cushion is sink. \n\nI have the scallops sambuca. The dish come with 4 big seared sea scallops. The pasta is the bow tie pasta. The sambuca sauce was accompanied well. The pasta also includes the shredded bacon. The dish is big with take home for next day. My wife has branzino of the sea. It is Mediterranean Sea bass. The fried the whole fish with checked score. It allow the interior of the fish fully fried. They also give a thought to stand the fish on the spinach bed and plum tomatoes. It is well presented. By standing the fish instead lay flat. It allows both side of the fish fully crispy while eating. \n\nThe pre-meal includes garlic rolls. It has good garlic butter oil on top. Our service is good. Our food definitely impressive.
