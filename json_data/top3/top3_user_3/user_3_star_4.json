I can be one. \n\nThis water front property has the killer bay view for the people who dine there. I would said it has nice sunset view. Price range is at high side for the food. The interior is well decorated. The dinning hall has the bay view. They have ball room can easily fit 200 people with bay east view. \n\nI was here for a society meeting. We was done in this ballroom that is beautiful for wedding. Our entr\u00e9e is not in the regular menu. It is shell pasta with stuff cheese in side. It accompanied with green beans and carrots. The food is good. This place is good with seafood and steak. \n\nThe service is good and attentive. Overall the welcoming host and restaurant do a good job.",

Very lively there. \n\nWe were there for the Nate Najar Quartet jazz music. This jazz team is well known in the Bay Area. Our share table has some people from St. Pete came here just for this night. This bar has many musicians performed here before. This is my first time to Independent and I like it due to their crazy bar tender. Nothing better to sat at the bar and see all the drink fly out from the bar. Sometimes you can chat to your neighbor and enjoy the music. I like it not too loud but the music is still can be appreciated. \n\nThey have some of bar food and good selection of local draft beers. I like it they post the percentage of the content of alcohol. You can know your limits when you order it if you have to drive home.",

I would said lunch has the best value here. \n\nWe arrive on the early and seating is not a problem at week end. Through out the meal time, we still can see some seating is available on lunch. \n\nWe have order the spicy tuna, rainbow, saki, Mexican rolls. The sushi includes escolar, surf clam, salmon. We also order some items from habachi and stir fried. \n\nThe roll I like is the Fuji roll. It has spicy tuna and top with salmon and drizzle with eel sauce. The steak and shrimp hibachi is my favorite on the cook side. I also like the appetizer as Gyoza and the dessert with fried banana with chocolate dip. \n\nOverall the service is great. The food is attractive. The serving speed is acceptable.",

    "text": "Before catching the flight, we like to have a catfish dinner. This restaurant locates 5 minutes from the airport. As a result you can time your meal before the flight. \n\nThe restaurant is affordable compare to any seafood restaurant in New Orleans. We have order a dozen of raw oysters and they are only $8. It came with reddish and cocktail sauce. The oysters are fresh and big. \n\nThe main course is the blacken catfish with Creole sauce with rice.  The catfish in New Orleans is great no matter which restaurant we went to. This restaurant also has the good catfish. I like the Creole sauce with smaller size shrimp in tomato base sauce. \n\nThe second dish is grilled tuna skew over rice Creole sauce. The tuna is assembling in the skew along with shrimp, onion, and bell pepper. The tuna is lightly season and grilled open flame. The shrimp along the skew is not as fresh as the tuna. The dish presentation is impressive with skew bridge over the Creole rice. \n\nThe service is good. The restaurant may need to renovate to newer furniture. I saw a lot of the local eat here due to good pricing.",

    "text": "Tonight is happy night to see my pal. Over the weekend I was able to meet up with Anna. But today I am meeting with three yelpiest friends to try the 7 course beef dish from my last review. \n\nI have seven beef dishes on other Vietnamese restaurant before. The first course is the raw slice beef in the vinegar onion broil. Then beef is wrapping in rice paper with veggie. The sauce inside the wrap can be hoisin sauce and dip it on the fish sauce.\n\nThe second course is herb marinated slice beef to be cooked in butter. Then it is wrapping with rice paper with vermicelli. The third course is the slice beef in peanut. The first three courses require some work to wrap it. Some is skill with the wrap. The trick is not to over fill with material. \n\nThe fourth course is the ground beef in tea leave. The ground beef is marinated then grill on the frying pan. The fifth course is the beef balls with shrimp chip. The beef ball is cook with clear vermicelli. This ball can be break into pieces and pickup with the shrimp chip. With the crispy of the shrimp chip and ground beef, it create the sensation of the crispy and meat flavor. The sixth course is the Sherrard beef with porridge. It top with some fried onion and the parsley. By mixing it provide some mixture of the flavor. The seventh course is the slice pork on the outwardly roll around the raw green onion. The slice beef is marinated and grilled outwardly. This course can be improved if they caramel the onion first before the slice beefs rolling will be better. It will take away the onion spiciness. \n\nOverall the food is good but challenge. It is a good meal to have when your group likes to have the long and good conversation. It will take time to finish. The two people for the seven courses are $35 and the 3 people are $45.",

We were here for lunch and it is Wednesday. \n\nWednesday in any outback have special in their menu. I have tried their $12 three course menu. The first course is the Caesar salad. The lettuce is fresh and crispy. My entree is the glaze grilled pork tenderloin with a size. I have chosen the grilled asparagus as my side and I have added an up charge item shrimp in the Barbie. The pork was grilled wonderfully with tender meat. Each cut of the pork has preserved their juice in each piece. The shrimp is grilled and maintain the size of the shrimp. Seasoning is well prepared in this case. The tomatoes are cut to half and well cook for mouth watering enjoyment. The asparagus is not dry after grilling.  Good technique. \n\nThe third course is the carrot cake. The sweetness is well mix that not loses the ingredient taste of the carrot. This is the restaurant that I have repeated when I am go to Bartow or Orlando and need the meal before meeting. Wednesday is always the best day since they have good deal for the three courses or four courses.",

    "text": "This restaurant is recommended by my client. He grew up from Puerto Rico and he has indicated the food is close to his mom cooking. The Spanish music play in the background with lively atmosphere. \n\nThis the first time I try Puerto Rican restaurant in USA. I have Puerto Rico cuisine at Puerto Rico before. I can said the restaurant at La Casona has interesting Puerto Rican menu. It include traditional Mofongo. Mofongo is a fried plantain-based dish from Puerto Rico. It is typically made with fried green plantains mashed together in a with broth, garlic, bit fried pork belly. It can be filled with vegetable, meat or seafood. This restaurant open since 1999. It have Spanish base customer. \n\nToday we have the seafood Mofongo and churrasco. The seafood Mofongo came with half of the lobster tail, shrimp, salty fish, muscle.  I was impress of my Mofongo serve with a bit wine base seafood broth. When you bite the olive they have cook with it, the wine juice came out and it is tasty and left wine fragrant in the mouth. This normally different than the Wikipedia description to prepare it. The broth base mix with the fried green plantain neutralize the salty of the broth. The two materials balance each other is the beauty of cooking. Good chef skill. The churrasco is ok. It can be better. Churrasco is Argentina food. Most of the time the Cuban restaurant prepare this dish better than anyone in Miami. You have choice with rice and bean or salad and sweet plantain. \n\nThe service is good and friendly. However, the close out and bring the check is slow. This restaurant customer tender to speak louder due the natural of the Spanish customer. Food is good portion. Most of time you will have enough to take home for the remained meal.",

Lastly we have the Top Shelf wings. This is must have item. It is about $0.20 more than normal outside restaurant wing place. However, it worth the money. This wing is marinated in mojo sauce, then grill over the open flame and top with the house sauce. It was delicious. \n\nOverall is good experience. The place has TV.

I like coating and the sauce of the Karaage. It is delicious. But the GYU Bao is just below average. The meat of the GYU is just not feel it.  \n\nWe also has the GYU yakitori. I like this one better. The meat is well marinated. The quantity of the skew is tiny. Can be larger. We have the Tako Amiyaki. This grilled octopus dish is a mush have. Very delicious. Our final dish is the Tekkadon. The tuna poke on the rice. Good amount of food. The rice seasoning is great. \n\nThe service is good. The price for the food is at the high side.

I have seen the previous food truck move out this location and become a restaurant. I believe one day they will too. \n\nWe have order the Tom Yum Soup. I would say this is the best I have taste. For this restaurant medium hot is too hot for many people. For me is just right. This restaurant definition of hotness is bring the heat. So be careful what you asking for. You may have difficult time to kiss your date after burning lip and past the caliente heat kiss to you love one. \n\nWe have order the crab fried rice and duck noodle soup. I have order the Thai hot and it came with it. I like it very much for this fried rice since it is different than other cuisine fried rice. The dish do have chunk of crab meat. The duck noodle is street type vendor flavor cooking. The duck is deboned and easy to enjoy. The curry base soup is yummy to eat. \n\nI give them 4 stars is they pricing is in the high side for food truck (value vs. restaurant setting) and they run out of material for certain dish. The food is 5 stars.",

I don't know they try to have you eat the main dish first so you won't ask for too much rice. Curry dish need to go with rice. Although is not intentionally but execution need to be corrected.",

In the good weather, you may need to come early if you want to sit outside. The restaurant serve German food and gyro. Interesting. The chef can handle two types of food. \n\nWe got the Jagerschnitzel. It is breaded pounded pork gravy with mushroom and bacon. The side is potatoes salad. This dish is good when you are hungry. Love the coating flavor on the pork. We also get the Doener Bowl. It is shave lamb with rice and one special sauce. This dish we added a knockwurst with sauerkraut and falafel, the wurst is good and brown finish outwardly. Falafel also tasty. \n\nOverall the food is good. Good thing we arrived before the big crowd. They only has one waitress. With their business they may need two. Many come here for the beer.",

One thing for sure my wife has said is to simplify the menu call out. It is difficult for the American to call out the Lao food name and it can be easily mixed up. \n\nWe start with the chicken wings and the Laap Beef. The wing is really good coating. The laap beef has good spicy item. It is good spicy to me but my friend said is too hot for them. But the restaurant did offer to lower the spiciness at the end for my friend to take home.

They also charge the flavor most often to keep me interested. \n\nDuring pandemic the inside seating is not available. But they do have outdoor seating. It is good to have ice cream and eat it there. This store may face lack of customers due to location. Don't know if the customer at Amateurwork will come here to enjoy the ice cream. We like the trio ice cream with three flavors. We got brambleberry crisp, rainbow buttermilk, and blackout chocolate cake. This three flavor is interesting.",

The dressing is good and complemented the collard. We also has one chicken and one steak Yakitori. Those have good flavor.

It came close to the planing. \n\nThe restaurant sales Chinese BBQ food such as pork, duck, crispy pork. You can buy it by the pound. This restaurant was here before along the Ding Ho oriental grocery store. \n\nThe best value is the beef noodle soup. The beef is stir fry and then add to the soup. The soup broth is chicken and bone base. The noodle is the Hong Kong egg noodle. The are thin and great to chew. Compare to Mc Donald. I will pick the value ($5.99) of this noodle soup anytime. It is more nutrition and fun to eat. \n\nThey also serve traditional Chinese dishes. If you like fried rice try their dry scallop fried rice. It stir fried with dried scallop and slice asparagus. The other dish are the beef with Chinese broccoli with beef in hoisin source also a good dish. This dish is more to American style dish but still kept the Chinese cuisine technic.\n\nThe surprise dish is the Taro Crispy Duck. The duck is deboned and marinated. The duck meat then lay on the bottom and top paste with ground taro. They are deep fried and chop into pieces. The accommodate with sweet soy sauce and garlic and scallion. They are crispy on top and bottom. The top is a crispy taro create the net type crispy good. The bottom is duck create slightly burn crispy. This is a killer dish.",

The correct way is slight dip the shrimp in wet bread and deep fried. Then drip a bit of tempura next to shrimp and create the crispy effect. However, this process needs to finish in less than 3 minute before over cook the shrimp. This restaurant has the technique for it. The box came with 9 pieces sashimi, cucumber salad, tuna roll, California roll, and imitations crab salad. The sashimi is fresh. Love the shrimp tempura. The shrimp tempura has to eat there.

You can see the popularity of local. \n\nThey jerk chicken and some traditional Caribbean dish like Ackee with salty fish. The selection includes large or small portion. I got their popular dish. The oxtail. The marinated sauce went into the bone. The meat is soft but have not fall off the bone yet. I prefer fall off the bone cooking. My dish come with good bean rice and braise cabbage. Both side are great. \n\nThe wait for the food is not bad. I got my food 15 minutes after order. It is considered fast with so many order ahead of me. Parking is free with lot in front of plaza.",

So we go for the popsicle instead. The price is about a bit above average. Not much of selection. But the selection is good enough to try. \n\nWe have the watermelon citrus and salty chocolate Elvis. The watermelon citrus I have tasted some chop up fruit remains. It is refreshing. The salty chocolate Elvis is something good feeling. Soft to bite and easy let it melt. I can hear some Elvis music now from Graceland. Put some sun glasses I will be Elvis myself. \n\nThey also offer dip or sprinkle. Dip it is $1, roll and drizzle is $0.75. Like I said they have waffles on the stick but machine was not operate that day. They also have grilled cheese, coffee and regular ice cream.",

I would go for the poke.\n\nThe poke dish has two protein in regular size or three protein with larger size. The difference is 6\" bowl and 10\" bowl. I would go for the large. The other thing I need to mention is their unlimited topping of you choice. I also like their protein choice. The have more choices on the protein and different than other poke place. It has the grilled eel option. Other things that attract you is their sauce is thicker and not watery. Which make this poke location a win win choice. \n\nWe like the larger size with larger diameter to contain more toppings. Above three reasosn will be the driving force for repeat customer.",

This time of year is still considered cold night and not many customers. \n\nI like Jeremiah because they have Italian ice and soft serve as a layer to separate the flavor.

But this restaurant offer a way out with affordable price if you want a Brazilian Grilled buffet. Their rotisserie grilled meat is good and beat the chain restaurant because they are less salty. \n\nRotisserie included the sausage, top sirloin, kabab, chicken drum stick, fillet mignon with bacon, garlic steak, sausage, Pork rib. Those are good selection. On top of the grilled meat, the hot food, salad and dessert also available for the taste. I like their egg plant salad.

    "text": "I would said the best Italian restaurant for my list.  Please read on why they did not get 5 stars. Do I come back. Hack yes. Hopefully I can give them a 5 stars next time. \n\nBefore you come to this restaurant, you need to know a few thing. 1. Do not just show up. Make a reservation. Even though they said is highly recommended, I said is a must. Almost every day for people just walk in they have to wait for 2.5 hours at dinner time. If you don't have reservation,come at the time they open. 2. Go for the menu items. They are match the value of the food. 3. Be patient. They really don't have much help on the kitchen since it always back up on the order. \n\nToday we show up with reservation and we still have to wait for our table to be ready. Not a long wait. While waiting there is a special of the day on the board for your choices. We have appetizer and pre-meal item that come with the entree. The first course is about 30 minutes. But the entree is about an hour wait. I did ask the waiter why. They have accommodated with addition wine and dessert no charge for our situation. \n\nWe begin our appetizer with Vongole Marechiara. It is the baby pasta clams saut\u00e9ed with garlic, basil, and white wine sauce. The sauce is great. Please ask a loaf of bread to go with it. It is excellent dipping the bread in this sauce. The baby clam is about 25 to 30 count. But they are small portion in the big bowl. They taste very good. \n\nMy entree is the special on the board. Pan seared blacken Scottish Salmon on top of roasted slice potato with house cure pork belly. The salmon cook just right and the fish is fresh. The cure pork belly is awesome. It is a bit pricy for this dish. The entree come with the soup or salad of your choice. \n\nThe restaurant only have the wine and beer for alcohol. We were accommodated with great dessert for the time lost while waiting. Seem like they have a smaller kitchen. This may be the only area they need to improve. Increase the speed of food preparation or bigger kitchen. Don't let the customer wait. \n\nThe dessert is magnificent. They brought out the Tiramisu, Cannoli, Lemon Cake, and pyramid chocolate. It look awesome when they are in one big plate. I applause they accommodated the customer long wait time.",

This sandwich includes Peruvian slaw, fried buttermilk chicken with cluck sauce. The chicken is crispy. The sauce is great. The entire assembly is harmony. We also hot the charcoal soft serve with peanut jam, coconut flakes, and banana slice. The charcoal soft serve is the best we have. Food is great here especially you look for snack. They also has pork bun which match Asian flavor. \n\nOverall we like it. But in winter raining day, the inside seating is impossible due low temperature AC unit. Too cold to seat inside.",

Tonight we have decided to go back to visit. Because our visit time is about 9:00 pm one hour before they close, there is no line. I wonder how this restaurant handles pressure when they have a lot customer. \n\nTonight is Wednesday and they are Happy Hour all day. Only Sunday and Wednesday is all day Happy Hours. All other day Happy Hour is from 4 to 7 pm. During the happy hour the appetizers range from $5 to $7. It is almost 40% off from the original price. We have order 3 appetizers from happy hours menu and one appetizer from regular menu. They are Spicy Thai Chicken, Crispy Fish Taco, Fillet Tip Egg Roll and we add a Crab and Shrimp Cake from regular menu. After we have order we realize that all items are deep fried. They have their tasty side. I like the crab and shrimp cake the most. I also like the Spicy Thai Chicken dipping sauce with sweet tangy flavor. \n\nSince we have so many appetizers, we only order one entr\u00e9e from their special - the Shrimp Diablo. It is spaghetti in red sauce with shrimp except they add a kid of spicy. I believe this dish is too plain and not exciting. I think this dish should not be served any more if they try to attract customer. The special is not special at all.\n\nOverall the service is excellent; food came out very quick since there is no other customer this late. Enjoy watching the Hokey NHL game with the TV with Tampa Bay Lighting score a goal at the buzzer to win.",

Many ladies enjoy this restaurant more than guys. If you walk in, the girls are more than the boys. It is really ladies choice of food. \n\nStacy Brown the founder and creator has her story of this restaurant of how it started. Interesting story was it. They have multiple selections of chicken salad type that will be some things for your plate. You also can sample the chicken salad before you make a choice of the ultimate salad you want. We have the jalape\u00f1o holly that day. It is tasty and good. We order chicken gourmet dish come with sandwich scoop, pasta salad and broccoli salad. I like the broccoli salad. \n\nThe interior decoration certainly the best I seen for the fast food store. They also have the small room can hold 20 people if you like to have the meeting there. Food is definitely healthy side in my book. Service is really good. I will return to this restaurant sometime soon for the chick magnet.",

Certainly this is not just for public but also for production by the scale they have. The welcome center has strawberry for sell. But they are not in pricing. Some of the strawberry we seen is a bit dark red in the box. May be we arrive about 5:15 pm.

It is above the average Italian restaurant but below the Gourmet Italian. However, I like the setting with full bar capabilities. I have been to Maggiano before my Yelp time. This return give me a good excuse to review this restaurant. \n\nThey have several private room for family eating. Some of this room has private bar if you want to have open bar. All this room can be link to big banquet hall. \n\nWe start with Caesar salads and the Maggiano salad. The Maggiano salad carry more weight and better flavor. They include crispy prosciutto taste like bacon.  Which make this salad the best. We have family style dish including Six cheese, Rigatoni, carbonara chicken, Tilapia. All this dish are delicious. The closing included the tiramisu and brownie ice cream. \n\nOverall experience is good. Love the private room and family style.",

    "text": "This Greek restaurant is a chain that just open in New Tampa a year ago. They are best system restaurant in this area. What I mean of that is from the time they receive the order to deliver the food is usually on target. Normally for the grilled food is taken more time especially for the kebab. They have enough man power and operation to make the assembly look easy and fast. Our foods deliver in 10 minutes and they are faster than any mini restaurant. I will not call this fast food since the foods are cook to your order. The cook is well train to shorten the time of deliver. \n\nTonight we have order on the light side of the menu. By the time we have added on the additional skew, it is not in the light side any more. We have order the lamb kebab and the chicken kebab and added a skew of steak kebab. Good value for dinner under $25 and use the yelp free drink offer by the restaurant. With the coupon, we have the reduction $5 of the total bill. \n\nThe kebab came with the side Greek salad and rice. It also comes with pita bread. The Greek salad is very flavorful. It has a potato salad in the middle of all the mix green (lettuce, tomato, red onion, beets, Kalamata olives, pickle green pepper, cucumber). The soft feta cheese is sprinkle over it. Lovely cheese. The skew meats (chicken, lamb and steak) are marinated and cook over the open grilled. They are will balance spice with Middle Eastern flavor. Taste sensation. I like the steak skew the best. If you take the meat from skew, the flavor stick in the finger with finger licking good. \n\nThe restaurant has small capacity seating. I like the kitchen crew shaving the Gyro with electric ring cutter. It was smoothly shave. Most of the gyro is shaving by knife which has no control of the thickness. This restaurant using the electrical shave has control over the thickness and allows crispiness. I don't like shave it too thick and cause the smell of the lamb Gyro. Technology has improved on food process. Like it.",

As a result, it is true neighborhood grocery store that convenience to local residents. \n\nI like our Publix due to their cleanest. The fruit is fresh. They have the sushi freshly made every day. The deli sandwich is good selection. Come to lunchtime, the line is long to get a sandwich or cold cut. The deli is easy for the housewife to pick ready cook items such as rotisseries chicken, fried shrimp and more. Bake good are make fresh daily. The frozen section is great to pick up heated items and ready to cook. I have my favorite such as frozen grilled quail and crab cake.\n\nIf you want to try your luck, the lottery is available at service station. Flower, Books, or Wine can be pick up easy and variety of choice. Parking is accessible and direct to the entrance. Publix always serve with smile and help on the push cart if you needed.",

    "text": "Jersey Mike's Sub is my favorite sandwich store. Because they are the only one that carry hot ham (cappacuolo). I have looking for many places and try to buy and slice myself but was not successful. The cappacuolo here is bit spicy and is in good taste. I always orders my sandwich just cappacuolo, lettuce, tomato, and the secret ingredient - bacon!!! I like to order them in wheat bread and spice up my sandwich Mike's way - oil, red vinaigrette, salt, pepper, and mike secret spice. No other thing added such as mayo. This is YUM. \n\nThe sub menu also has the club supreme, original Italian, roast beef and provolone, the super sub. Other than the sub I like above, I like the super sub which is No. 5 sub. Provolone, ham, prosciuttini and cappacuolo and I alway add bacon. This is the restaurant after I have greasy food the night before and I come here to redeem myself. Interesting to said I am redeem with two strip of bacons. \n\nOther than the cold sub, they also have hot sub such as Steak Philly, big kahuna cheese steak, meat ball, chicken Parmesan, Reuben , chipotle. Lake many sub store start adding the frito chip to create crunchy feeling. I think this direction has ruined many year of tradition.",

The lechon is the fried pork belly. It is crispy when I get it. My wife has the adobo chicken, lumpia and the rice noodle. This food are great. Especially the adobo chicken was cook nice and different from many adobo that I have taste in a good way.\n\nWe also have the halo halo. The drink have a lot of thing inside including different types of jelly and bean. Love the purple ice cream. It is fancy. The reason they are not 5 stars is all food are serve at tray and pick your combination. I hope they can cook by order at the spot to keep the food hot by order instead from the seating tray pick up order.",

    "text": "This is hot place for ramen in town. They are not the cheapest in town but good taste. The reservation can be setup or you have to wait for long time at restaurants. They do have the bar section to wait before you sit. \n\nI have the champon ramen. This supposed to must try ramen. They are $16 is most expensive in the Bay Area. The soup base is good not the best in Bay Area. However, the taste is make up with the accompanying ginger tempura, fried sesame seed and other items make this soup better than most ramen restaurant. I have to said this is not the traditional way of ramen material for pork belly or grilled shrimp. However, it has good flavor. The pork belly do have the three part harmony (skin, fat, meat) cooking. In fact I like their way. The shrimp is great with good touch of marinated and grilled. \n\nThe reason they are 4 stars are as below: 1. I was there at the 5 pm starting the dinner service. The restaurant is empty and they decided call in group by group and take 15 minutes. Ridiculous!  They can go in all the first group to fill the restaurant and they choose not. 2. If you paid $16 dollars for they most like-able ramen, why they don't include all combination include the fermented egg, seaweed, bacon. This is top dollar bowl already. 3. If the price is the most pricy among the ramen restaurant, why we have to sit on stool. Put some comfortable chair please. This is America not Japan. Even in Japan they have seat with back support except the bar counter area. \n\nThis is not to put down a restaurant but a lesson and opinions for the restaurant to improve. Food is good. When the honeymoon period is over, they need to think how to get the customer for revisit. Food is 5 stars.",

They have the running water sink you can wash your hand. \n\nWe have ordered three tacos - Pastor, Carnitas, and the Steak taco. The best is the steak taco. It come with seasoning and pan grilled. The carnitas is tasty also. Their shredded pork was marinated. They have single corn tortillas which may break easily.

Personally, I like whole fish to eat and left only the bone. With that said, their brand is to have good seafood. I always have good respect for this restaurant. \n\nWe start with corn chowder with lump crabmeat. The chowder is great. However I would suggest saut\u00e9ed the crab meat which will make this soup more superior. \n\nOur entr\u00e9e are the grilled red fish. This very good dish. It is not in the regular menu. Redfish is bit harder to catch. The meat definitely is nice and good. It is accompanied the string green bean and crawfish etouffee. This is very excellent dish. \n\nOur next entr\u00e9e is sirloin and crab cake. I like the crab cake but the sirloin is average. It come with two side and I have crab fried rice. Again, the crab meat need to include in the fried rice while they stir fry. Not added with broil lumb crab meat. \n\nThe service is great. It has seamless coordination.",

It is close to 4.5 stars for the way they have prepared the food. I like is very much. The reason they are 4 stars is the quantity they have served in the dinner time. Their portion is small for the dinner. But some people just eat a lot of rice with curry sauce. \n\nIf I come to the buffet, I may have rate them 5 stars. We have the Fish Molee and the Beef Malabar Curry. The fish is Basa and fried first before the curry. Love the turmeric, green chili, ginger and coconut milk. This is a good dish to enjoy because the coconut curry is out of the wold. \n\nThe beef malabar is good spice. We east the meat and take the sauce home. It is still good to enjoy with the rice.

The fish is sushi grade with Panko crusted on the coating and lightly fried. It come with avocado which accommodate well in the burger. We also has the OMG burger number 10. It is double patty close to half pound meat. It has two big pieces of smoke bacon on top. Love it. \n\nFood is good here. What make them no much competitive is price. Burger range from $7 to $10. Add other side can get you to $14. It is regular restaurant price. I still consider this is a fast food joint but not quite with twist of different in table service.

The store provide the complimentary brownie cake with coconut flakes. Love it. It good promotion to get the restaurant going. \n\nWe three taco combo. The taco is divided to classic and specialty. Any in the specialty taco add $0.50 each taco. We got the campechano, grilled grouper, and grilled shrimp tacos. I paid extra dollars for the specialty taco. Which worth it. The combo plate come with chip, salsa, and a drink. Not bad at all. My wife got the steak quesadilla. The steak is well grilled. \n\nI would recommend the campechano and grilled shrimp tacos. It was delicious. Food come out quick with not much wait. Seating is limited but enough for the dine in conditions.",

It come with 9 wings with $1.4 per wings is in the high price side. The wings did a good job with ghost pepper. My entree is the Blackened Redfish. This dish come with vegetables medley and rice. It top with crawfish sauce. Crawfish also taste good like Cajun. A very rare dish to have. My wife have the Carolina Slow Roasted Pork. The sauce is honey mustard sauce which is very similar to the BBQ we have when we travel to North Carolina.

You are here not for the great taste of Chinese food but for the something quick and fresh. The special is $5.50 with lunch cook at the spot and a soft drink. Very good deal. I have the schezuan pork with fried rice. The veggies in the pork are crispy which mean very fresh. Like it that way. Some restaurants don't have the controls of the material.

They have offer the pho, Hu Tieu southern Vietnam noodle soup, stir fry noodle, vermicelli, fried rice, and the special. They also have variety of appetizers. \n\nWe have order the pork skin roll, pork sausage roll, roasted quails and southern Vietnam combination (Hu Tieu). The pork skin roll is wrapping like a fresh roll with peanuts and pork skin. This is a blend taste fresh roll. The pork sausage roll is also a fresh roll with charbroil pork sausage. The pork is well grilled and has a wonderful taste. I like this roll. \n\nThe roast quails are not the best in the Bay Area but they are excellent dish. The dish come with salt and pepper on the side which I think you can eat without it. The quail smell good and I always eat with my fingers. \n\nThe southern combination noodle soup is in clear broth. This is not pho but it is wonderful dish and very light. It is good for people who are in weight watching. The noodle is the medium size egg noodle. The soup come with combination seafood and slices pork. \n\nOverall the experience is good. The service is good also. The waiter and waitress are still learning the menu. I will be back for the second page menu.",

They main reason they survive for so long is due to their regular customers. There is a reason why people keep coming back. The reason are quantity of food and affordable to many. \n\nWe have chop BBQ pork sandwich. I this this is their best seller because the chop pork and house sauce make this dish savory. We also has two meat combo. This dish I consider is a value dish. We got baby back rib and chicken. It come with 4 bone rib and quarter chicken in good price. I like they provide the BBQ sauce in warm condition which not sit on the table and condensed. This may be their selling point for the regular who coming back.",

I hope they have improved when I visit them.\n\nWe have ordered shrimp and lobster chowder and signature salad to start. The chowder is creamy with small size shrimp that cook for long time. It blend well with the lobster and potatoes inside. The signature salad got good dressing. The most intriguing is the honey walnut with strawberry. \n\nOur main entr\u00e9e are the Grilled Lamb Chop and Flat Iron Steak. I would not recommend flat iron steak since this steak have a lot of tendon. It difficult to bite. A lot of cutting to remove make smaller piece. The lamb chop is nicely decorated. The only complaint is they cook these lamb chop to almost well done which I ask for medium. I also asking for sauce to be on the side which they didn't do.  \n\nOverall service is attentive.

If not because of that, I may have give them 5 stars for crab along. \n\nThis shack really doesn't have a good place to sit and eat. Basically is a take out place. The day I have visited, they have 10 blue crab crawl for $3. They can cook crab by fried or steam garlic. The price varies due to the size of your choice. \n\nThey serve other seafood which I may not able to said anything about it since I only like their blue crab. They have oyster, shrimp, clam strip, crab cake, devil crab, wings, snow crab, fish, gumbo, corn dog. Any how. Go for the blue crab.",

If you pick the wrong thing, it is your fault. No body to blame. \n\nOverall l like to have this U pick restaurant.

Good cleaning technique without sand trap. \n\nService is good. As I said to the BBQ before. Don't bring any leather cloth or purse to the restaurant. It is a big smoke house.

This will take out the crowed conditions for serving and the busy kitchen situation. This will give them a fare review. \n\nWe have order the two appetizer- the Roti and the Pla Muek Yang. The roti is two round roti cut in eight pieces. It has the Malaysian roti taste. Although this may be from packaged factory made but was pan fried perfectly.

I have order the Phat Chinese Broccoli and pork belly and they have given me Asian BBQ pork and Pork Belly  noodle. I did not ask them to change since it look interesting.

The spicy chicken noodle are very close to Thai street noddle but in the sweet side. This two dishes is just ok. \n\nFood is about 3.5 rating; service is about 4.0 and the kitchen crew is about 3 ratings.

This place is one of them. I got the veggies beef soup as the side. It is wonderful. We also got one of the day special with strawberry French toast.

This newly open restaurant has good and ok App. You will be the judge. I was surprised that at 5:16 pm, this place is pack already. So get there early if you want to try their happy hour. \n\nWe started with the devil Egg and philly flatbread. I would recommend the devil Egg. The topping with the fried candies pork belly is delicious. The philly flatbread need work. The meat of shaved ribeye is too little. It need to be more for that price. We added the Fabio's meatballs. This one comes with grits. The last dish we have is the Italian Steak. This is the New York strip cut. The steak is cook to asking temperature. If this dish come with broccolini will be better. But I also like the asparagus. \n\nThe drink I have is the cotton Candy cosmo. It is good show. I give them an \"A\" for the food come out really quick. Good kitchen work.",

So you have to arrive and find out your fate. On the weekend is over hour to get in. However, they get your cell phone number and text you when the table is ready. Once they text you, you have 5 minutes to respond that you still want your table, then 5 minutes to show up. Which give you time to walk around the mall. If you need 10 minutes time to walk back. Don't respond immediately, response close to your 5 minutes is up. \n\nThe decorations is definitely eye catching. I like many of the ambient. It is beautiful. It is fiesta atmosphere. Seem like you seat on open air restaurant with stars hanging over you. Music is good volume and still able to make conversation at bar area. \n\nThe food is the main thing that they need to make the most improvement. Go from the bad to good. The taco are the area need to make the most improvement. We have order 4 tacos. The shrimp, blacken fish, cochinita (roast pork) and carne Asada (wood grilled steak). The pork is lack of flavor. The fish is dry and over cook, the shrimp is just broil and serve. The best is the steak that is a star. I would suggest control how the fish is cook. The pork may be need to marinate and cook in the thicker sauce and the shrimp grilled it before put it in the taco. \n\nThe entr\u00e9e is the ceviche and the grilled chicken with mole chocolate sauce. I like both of the dish. It is not a wow but above average. I do like their table side guacamole. They have options for the spiciness and chunky of the avocado.

If you come to shop at the Italian market next door, may be plan a visit. \n\nThis restaurant is mom and pop shop. Some of the customers said they move from other place. Their rotisserie chicken has good marinated spice. I would said it is one of the better one in Bay Area. The chicken is well marinated to the bone. It is tender and juicy. The accompanying is the white rice and fresh salad. If they can improve these two items, they may be able to sell better. \n\nThey do have some good looking dessert that we didn't try on this trip. It is definitely worth a shot.",

The store is located at the center of the walkway. \n\nThe analogy is interesting like a mad scientist to create the experiment drink. Watch up the science of boba cooking. I have the special drink in the menu - rainbow ripple. The lady who make the tea forget to add the boba into it. I have added it later. What make this tea interesting is the presentation, I like their creation with rainbow sprinkles on top of the whip cream. This drink is strawberry base. \n\nI like my wife drink a bit better. She has the cookie and cream. It add a real cookies and cream in the mixed of the drink. It is interesting rich drink. I cannot say for all other drink. But their special drink score a 4 stars. Price for the boba drink in Bay Area is at the high side.",

During the odd hour of 3:30 pm, there is a lot of high school student hang out. Other than drink, they also have sushi, salad, rice bowl, sweet toast. \n\nFor the main selection are the drink. They have ice tea, milk tea, smoothies, cold coffee. And they have add on like boba, jelly,  and fruit. For the ice tea, I like their Kumquat lemon ice tea and black tea. Today I have the avocado smoothies. I add boba into the smoothies. The boba need to be broil to soft and add the sugar water at the bottom of the smoothies. The avocado flavor was added into shave ice and ground together. \n\nThe pricing for the smoothies is average in the Bay Area. The drink is non fat and the calories is approximately 100 to 140 for smoothies.",

The music venue sometime is free but most of the time requires a small cover fees.  However, you can eat at the restaurant without attending the music venue and not charge with the fees. \n\nThe restaurant has a lot non typical food from the swamp or sea.

The ambient is very interesting that the restaurant is constructed from a shack. The full menu offer a lot of seafood dish found in many restaurant.

Their sushi category divided into cook, raw, or tempura. \n\nI have order two of their signature roll. The Nambomb and the Sunburn. The Nambomb is real snow crab in fill. Not the imitation krab meat. The snow crab meat was mix and mash with creamy sauce. The it roll and top with tuna and salmon. I like the in fill snow crab meat. The Sunburn is roast beef top on the roll. The in fill is lobster meat. The only comment I made is they need to do something about the beef. Instead of roast beef, may be they can create their own beef is more attractive such as grilled beef. \n\nOverall experience is good. The restaurant still young.

The display letter size in the screen also in larger font size. It is easy to ready for young and old. Especially for old people. I like the blue background screen to reduce the reflection of the sun. \n\nIt also has boat fuel. Since it is at it honeymoon period, the gas is cheaper. Now the nearby gas station also lower the price. Good for the consumer. It don't have right in and out to SR 60 but it has share use entrance.",

It great to be the neighborhood restaurant near Cypress. This restaurant is cucina with meat market. \n\nThe Boozy Pig has good dish in the menu. We have many choices. We got the their Rocket Man and The Smoke Chicken Purtine. Rocket Man just like jet fuse. It is Wagyu Beef Pastrami with kimchi and melting cheese. It is a rocket fuse. \n\nThe Smoke Chicken Purtine go with fried and dripping cheese. It sprinkled with bacon. It is a good finger food. I would eat this dish first before the rocket man. Because rocket man has stronger taste will overpower the smoke chicken purtine. \n\nThe few things that keep them from my 5 stars is the side we got is braised collards is $4. A bit at expensive. Most dish come with side dish but here is added on.",

    "text": "Hibachi night. My wife have been to this restaurant many time and this is my first. I am usually not order the steak. I am usually order the seafood. The steak cook on the hot  steel plate is usually not as good open flame grilled.\n\nTonight we have started with onion mushroom soup and ginger salad- come with the meal. The fried onion soup is great but the ginger salad is so so. I think their ginger dressing is too little. To taste a good sushi chef you always order the spicy tuna as a test drive. The sushi came with whole piece cube tuna and slice cucumber. They have a bit of wasabi to make it a bit spicy. A true spicy tuna should be hand chop and dice into tiny pieces then add the sesame oil, raw quail egg, and spicy chili sauce. Then, they are mixed together and wrap in the seaweed wrap. This is true spicy tuna. I believe they have fail at this department. \n\nOur entree is the calamari and tuna with shrimp. We have specified how they are cook. The tuna is seared the outside and the calamari needs to burn a little bit on the out side. The chef did a very good job on this dish not only preserve the good quality of the material and also well season for the hot steel plate cooking. \n\nI would not recommend any sushi but highly recommend the hibachi. Be brave to order the calamari and try it. You will not disappointed. The service is good. As a result they deserve 4 star. If you come with your birthday ID and with a paid friend. The birthday entree is free. For the lady, do not need to wear expensive dress due to the food smoke may stick to your dress, hair and hand bag. You only dress for food. Be prepare wash your hair after visit due to food smoke may stick to your body. That is the price of hibachi.",

The supermarket located just off the SR 60. \n\nMany of the service people may not able to communicate in English (Espanol only). By the way, I have stay in Miami for 11 years as little Spanish I know I can survive. This small matter doesn't affect me. The best language is body language. We were able to ask them to pick the food by pound in different container. I believe you also can do it too. My universal language is finger. Pointing and number  count to ten is the most I can do - haha. \n\nThe supermarket has the hot deli section to buy food by pound, sandwich assembly, salad, marinated seafood, fried whole fish, dessert and more. They also have regular grocery sections with seafood, meat, veggie and fruit. The different cut of meat can be found here. By the way, when you check in here, the  yelp complimentary 10% discount coupon with check in, they will not honor. \n\nThe supermarket also has cell phone sales, hair cut and fast food box service. This is rather interesting place like I am actual back to the Miami.",

The food came out very quick and the service is good. This restaurant always fills with people no matter what time you go. \n\nThe pho soup is not the best in the Bay Area but it good enough. The Beef Combination Noodle Soup or pho is come with Sliced Beef, Flank, Brisket, Tendon, Tripe and Beef Meatball. It served with bean sprouts, basil leaves, lime, and hot peppers, topped scallions and onion. There is a lot items to find in the soup and try to get them out. This a good dish when you catching cold or just to eat. \n\nThe frog leg is deep fried and marinated in salt and pepper. It serves with a sweet sauce on the side. The leg is very crispy and the deep fried enhance the flavor. \n\nWe also order a pre-meal drink. The rainbow drink. This drink is very colorful and pleasing to the eyes. It has the Red bean, yellow bean and green jelly, topped with Coconut cream and crushed ice. You have to mix it before you drink or spoon feed.  \n\nI like this restaurant overall.

You will need to order at the counter and find a seat after your ordering and they will bring the food. \n\nThe restaurant is a typical sandwich cook to order. The selection starts at Philly cheese steak to hot pressed sandwich. They also have the Black Angus burgers for your selection. Lunch time is a line. I am not sure they take order over phone. The dinner and lunch have the same menu. We were here for the dinner. We have order the Cajun Chicken Cordon Bleu and the Uncle Muzzies   Mufaletta. The chicken is well season with Cajun spice and top with Capicola ham. The sandwich is yummy and the chicken is half breast. They are juicy since they seal the juice of the breast inside. The Muzzies Mufaletta is the similar name to the general store in the New Orleans that sells the Mufaletta. The different of the mufaletta here is there are hot pressed. The sandwich includes smoke ham, genoa salami and provolone cheese with green olive in Cuban bread. What a strange combination. The sandwich is not bad but they are not as good as the New Orleans.\n\nOverall the restaurant is good. I did not try their burger since they are rated number 1 in New Tampa. May be next time I should try that.",

We arrived at 7 pm and the prime rib already sold out. We cannot beat retiree around that area that comes early. Just kidding. \n\nWe start our night with the steamer. Nick is the experts in this area. He shows us how to eat it. The steamer is steam to cook first. The outer black skin need to undress from the clam body. Then it is clean in the broth or beer. Then dip into to butter and enjoy by eating it. Some has added pepper and lemon after clean it. This is a very adventurous item in the menu. \n\nI have the fried sea scallop and fried whole snapper. The snapper come with the batter coating outside. When come to whole fried fish, you want to make sure the meat inside is cook. This restaurant did it correctly. The only thing is the coating is tasteless. I prefer it to be season. However the fish is fresh and good. For fresh seafood, you do not require too much seasoning. \n\nThe fried scallop is very tasty because the coating was seasoning with flavor. When you break the scallop, the meat of the scallop is like a string which means the freshness of the food. \n\nOverall the seafood is fresh, the portion is very generous, and the service is great.",

This place has more people when we finish our dinner. I was surprised more would came late night. \n\nWe got the Korean Japchae. This is glass noodle vegetable dish with shiitake mushroom. The sauce is right. The sesame oil is fragrance enough. It is good dish. We also got the beef bulgogi. This dish is a bit let down compare to my first visit. Because they beef quality has a lot tendon. Tough to bite. \n\nOverall we have a good night here. Service attentive is a bit behind. I have to flag down waiter or waitress to get attention.",

This is a place to hang out for late night. \n\nThe place has a lot different types of games on the ground. It is great to see that in the amenities of the restaurant. You can try different games and they are great. It is almost like cruise ship games area. \n\nThe food selection is great. I would said Asian fusion yet can be Mexican or American cuisine. We got the chicken wings. This wing is almost like fried and bake. The coating is Malaysian Chili Paste. This paste is very similar to shrimp paste. Then top with fried garlic. Perfect touch. We also got grouper tostada. It interesting to have it. Not much memorable like the wing. \n\nOverall we like the concept with beer. A great hang out place. One thing to improve is tone down the speaker volume in the garage seating area. I understand they need to be loud for the people hear over the open area but not at the confine area.",

The meat also separated from the bone which good technique. The BBQ chicken is well smoked flavor. Juicy enough for it. \n\nThe collard green and rice are the good side.

My son teacher when he has the math competition at East Bay High School, Our neighbor and Rachel M. This must be good restaurant to visit.\n \nThe restaurant has the harbor view that out look to the gulf. We were having the choice of the inside or outside seating. This time of the year with 74 degree outside temperature, the outside sitting is comfortable. Our waiter is quick on the feet to show us the favorite dish in the menu. We have order the Cajun Salmon and the Tuna Tokyo that was recommended by the waiter. The food came in about 15 minutes. My dish is the Cajun Salmon that come with rice and zucchini. The zucchini is stir fry and lightly grilled over the open flame. This is the technique of the chef uses stir fry with the right seasoning and grilled it to add the flavor of the open flame. The Cajun spice on the salmon is almost like the blacken preparation.  The fish is prepared superbly to dine. The Tuna Tokyo is delicious too. The Sashimi grade tuna is grilled outwardly and slice in the \u00bc\" piece and spread over the rice and steam green bean. Most of the restaurant sear the tuna with peppercorn but this restaurant use the grilled technique for the tuna. The inside is still like sashimi and great to eat. This is a know how to handle the material and maintain the high grade for the taste. The tuna is drizzle with sweet wasabi sweet soy sauce. The balance of the drizzle sauce to be contacted with the freshly grilled outward meat make sense. Well done by the chef.\n\nThe lunch price is very reasonable for fine dining.  We were happy to be here to enjoy the great weather and accompany with great food. This is definite a place to go. We will be back for more. The service is good and quick. The host also seat us quick.",

The protein we recommended are the tuna, grilled steak and shrimp tempura. You also can choose three different sauce. Sauce to be on top of the bowl or side can be selected. \n\nI like the their beignets dessert. It taste like mochi. But it is great with condensed milk. The most I like is the pork dumplings. It has a good dipping sauce. \n\nThey serve the sushi burrito, mini nori, sushi roll. It is simple food. They are good is because they have good flavor.",

This American diner definitely has it place in the soho area. \n\nWe got shrimp pop boy. It has 11 shrimps count and mid size shrimp. Good value. I also like the yellow sauce add on it. Our second dish is the De Rueben. This is roast corn beef in the sandwich. The Russian dressing with the grilled toasted bread made this dish savory. Great bite to have. We choose the cucumber salad on the side go well with the sandwich. \n\nOur last dish is tuna taco. The tuna was seared. But I think is over seared to cook the inside too. However, the bowl was good to have. It has sprinkles some tortilla chip on top. \n\nOur service is the best for the night. That the reason I said put them in the map of soho. The food came out quick.

Reservation is highly recommended because it alway full house in the restaurant. \n\nWe started with the garlic knots and salad. The salad has good dressing. The garlic knots is a bit dry until you discover the butter sauce at the bottom. \n\nOur entree is the Nodina di Maiale. It is pork chop in honey mustard brandy sauce. It was delicious. It also accompanied with some veggies with artichoke and sun dried tomatoes. Our second entree is the Mare e Monti. Surf and turf. It has the scallops, shrimp and veal in lemon butter sauce. \n\nOur service is attentive. The price for the food is affordable. Atmosphere is good but I think the seating is a bit tight.",

The also has some fusion of the two cuisine dish. I only have the experience on the Thai side. I will update when I try their fusion dish. \n\nThis restaurant can heat it up the chili spiciness since they have the use of Mexican chili. If you like spicy food, look no further. It is sweaty hot. It also can go up a level to numb your lip. \n\nI have the basil spicy calamari. I have order the Thai hot. It did not disappoint me. This dish is wet sauce compare to some with dry sauce. It has good flavor. My friend ordered the fried rice. I think it need a bit hot oil burn and stir fried. \n\nOverall we like our time there. I like their watermelon boba.

The spicy tuna can be improved to make it dice cube to be more firm on the fish meat. The Bahamas roll is great. It is baked chop scallop with sherrard imitation crab meat over California roll.

But I applause their attitude to create new dishes on their special of the night. \n\nI was surprised the restaurant has good interior and seat. We were their fist customers when they just began to open on Monday. They usually close on Monday. We have order the chicken biryanis and the Mutton Masala with rice and naan. The biryanis to me need more heavy spice. Chicken may need more seasoning. On the other hand, the Mutton or goat meat is excellent. Masala is a mixed of many spice and create the base. It may varied from different restaurant due to the mystery of the spice use. But I can said I love this dish. The naan is blend. Not sure they make it by themselves. \n\nIn order to attract more people, I think they need to change the way of business. They need to change the plastic ware for the plate and utensils to better presentable serving ware. Disposable ware shouldn't be used for the dine in condition.",

I have ordered the Baja Fish, Pork Belly, Spicy Chorizo, Fried Oyster, Curry Shrimp, Sesame Ribeye, and Duck Taco. I like the oyster, duck and pork belly tacos. \n\nThe service is great in the beginning but it takes too much time to close up for the check. I like them for quick snack in the future.

Very good porch egg with flavor. Their pork broth is at the light side. This is their style. I like the most is their Kiwami Torch. It is spicy king crab top with torch white tuna. Very flavorful. \n\nFood come out quick. Service is good. I give them an A for just open and paid attention to detail. It is about 4.5 stars restaurant. Since the quantity is is less for ramen and chicken Karage, it is 4 stars.",

Sitting is better, more room for customers. But one thing is they are competed with established local taco restaurant. They have huge menu allow them to have more choices than other. Hopefully will bring more customers. \n\nI got the grilled grouper quesadilla. The grouper is blackened and grilled but I did not feel the flavor of blackened. It may need to be heavier spice. The quesadilla is average. My wife have the Carnitas burrito which is much better than my order. The carnitas was well marinated. They also pack a lot into the burrito with meat. It make the hungry people enjoy the meal. \n\nOverall our experience is good. Improvement has been made.",

I got my lunch with that choice. They give me a good portion with their gravy. I also added the fried pork belly. The skin is crispy. My second dish was the king fish. I saw they have cold fish on display. They immediately offer me if I want a hot piece not the chill fish. They fried a big piece while I am waiting. All lunch come with rice and choice of side. I got the cucumber salad and the sweet plantain. \n\nFood is delicious after 30 minutes drove home and eat. The store clerk was friendly. I like to try their juice and coffee next time.

It created the less contact condition. \n\nWe like their whole grilled chicken. The chicken is marinated with good spice. Chicken was butterfly opening to grilled. So it can completely grill inside the bone and outside surface. It also allow the marinated sauce with maximum exposure. The butterfly chicken is beautifully displayed. Our sides are the yellow rice and the baba ghanoush. All of them are delicious. The whole chicken is great deal all the time. \n\nDrive through is not most easy for this kind of food due to complicated order. Wait will be needed.",

However the spice and ingredients are there. With that said. Let me get into the experience. \n\nMitmita is actually meaning one of the Ethiopian Spice. It can be mixed and make many dish. I like the restaurant reflecting their true calling. The culture of food is use a piece of injera to pick up a bit of entree by hand and eat it. That is how it done to enjoy the different cuisine. \n\nWe have a group there can try different dishes. Injera is a crepe type sheet for pick up the food. The best dish is the Ye-doro Wat. This is a chicken dish with Ethiopian Ber-bere sauce. The sauce has so many ingredients. It is flavorful. We also order the  Kat Wat the chop beef with Ethiopian bbq sauce, Kitfo the lean beef is with the Mitmita sauce, Gored Gored the raw tenderloin beef with amaze sauce. Those are good dishes. \n\nAfterward we have Ethiopian coffee with ceremony incense to celebrate special occasions. It was a great celebration. On the appetizers, we have the chicken, veggies, and beef sambusa. Very tasty. We have good time there.",

But when I open at home is grilled pork lion. It is still taste good. \n\nThe entry come with complimentary dessert as a flan. It is delicious too. Other mixed up the order, the food is still good.

Food and ingredients is not complicated since they don't have beef tripe and pork tendon to prepare. \n\nThe green mint pho is typical Vietnamese combination pho without the two ingredients that I have mention. As a result, they are easier to assemble. They do have the pho at the right tone. My wife orders the grilled chicken and adds the grilled pork bun. It is extra cost to add the extra item of grilled meat. It come with mixed green pickle veggies and house sweet chilies sauce. I like her choice better since the grilled chicken is excellent. If they can create a good grilled meat with excellent marinate, I can imagine their Banh Mi must be good. I will try that next time. \n\nWe also have the boba with papaya and taro.

I have order the Hot and Crunchy Tuna Bowl and the Dynamite Crab Roll. The Tuna is seared and chop into pieces. The crunchy part is actually from the tempura batter onion. This dish actually can be improve if they have season the tuna with spice and seared and slice instead of chop cube. I like the bowl with brown rice. The Dynamite Crab Roll is included the Alaskan crab meat. I think the mango overtake the taste of the crab meat. I have a chance to try our friend share plate with Dino & Jimmy roll.

It is well season and correct dressing. \n\nDuring the Sunday, all day happy hour price. Now, this a deal! I have the sangria with red wine. This is a giant glass. One glass is enough.

    "text": "The restaurant is pushing out the new menu with $9 dish in 9 minutes or free. We are the in their email list that allow us to buy one $9 menu and has the second one free. It is a steal and the promotion run to 3/1 with email coupon. \n\nThe new $9 menu has to order from the kitchen counter. The kitchen counter only operates from monad to Thursday. We have tried their pork belly chicken carbonara, prosciutto and chicken penne, brisket rigatoni, and diavola scaloppine. The one we like the most are pork belly chicken carbonara and prosciutto and chicken angel hair. After the order, they will give you a number and you can select any empty table.  By the way, you will not expect a lot table service. \n\nSince the meal come out in 9 minutes, the whole dinner only need less than half hour. This is deigning for quick outlet and short time. You have to love the pasta dish in order to love this $9 meal. They also run the 7 minutes $7 lunch. It will be good with short time lunch break with restaurant entree. You will in and out the restaurant in 30 minutes. Thus it is the faster dinner ever.",

Cajun has become part of special cuisine in Louisiana. Cajun creole style has many type.  This restaurant special in popboys with grilled and fried.  \n\nTheir menu included blacken or fried shrimp, catfish, chicken, and fried oyster. They also has Alligator sausage that I have not try. After 3 pm, the Abita beer is dollar off. This restaurant close early. They don't open pass 6 pm and some of the day close at 4 pm. \n\nToday I am going to mixed and match. I ordered the half grilled shrimp and half fried oyster popboy. The Cajun spice on the grilled shrimp is good. I also has the blacken catfish. It was good blacken with fresh catfish. I like the edge of the blacken catfish. It has the most flavor. \n\nThe wait of the food is good, no too long of wait. It is an open air restaurant. It great to enjoy at 70 degrees temperature day.",

They really has pick up most of review negative comments and make a good turn to good. I would give them a 5 stars on the improvement. Keep it up. \n\nThey very close to above the 4.5 stars. But not yet. Still they are move in the right direction. The flavor need to be a wow factor. So far they are close. But can be better. They need to know the best seller and may be a wow flavor. We have the Jolly green Apple and Mint want cookies flavor. Both of them are good. The green apple is a sorbet. It has very nice color. I like kiddy color very attractive. The apple flavor need to be a bit stronger. I like the mint cookie. It is interesting. \n\nOur experience there is great. It is comfy to enjoy the ice cream there.",

The cassada torte has a cannoli place on top. The middle has two layers of cake and mousse and a layer of chocolate. The cake is moist and has syrup in it. It is tasty. \n\nThe carrot cake is good.

It is the second restaurant like this I have visited. \n\nI start with the drink of Blackberry Moonshine Swirl. It is beautiful drink with ice and alcohol. It fruity, ice, moonshine, like frozen margarita. Our main dish is blackened redfish. Not many restaurant have redfish. I have the blackened redfish double blackened. It come with sweet corn grit. I substituted the green bean with a cup of Duck and Andouille gumbo. Gumbo is delicious. My wife have the Crawfish Etouffee. The soup is not fish which tell you fresh enough. \n\nThe food experience is good. We end our night with beignets. They may need to work on this item. The inside is still dough soft. It need to raise the dough enough to get to the inside out crispy. Service is excellent and well train. Average working age is very young for the waiter and waitress. This bar has a lot big TV. Definitely match the name of sport bar.",

You may think the parking is a problem but they have designated lot for the brewery across the street. Easy access. \n\nThis is a locally craft beer. They do have some interesting beer. Including kumquat and orange crush. These are the local fruit that make good use in the local brewery. Good thinking to represent the local. Do you know we have kumquat festival in Dade City. \n\nDeja Moo Nitro has some exquisite taste for dark beer. The peanut butter Deja Moo is interesting. They have some beer I will try on next visit. They also has sour beer such as Sakura. There is a name of the beer call ginger mullet. Actually no ginger or mullet. \n\nThe deco is contemporary. So good art work. Mostly high top chair.

The new space also have large bar area. We were there for the happy hours. It was our fourth stops. \n\nThe happy hour menu is simple. But it is good enough to enjoy your time here. Our group order the Crispy Buffalo Brussels, Watermelon Bruschetta, and Swedish Meet Ball. I don't like the Brussels that much. May because it is Buffalo which involves sour vinegar. I like the Watermelon Bruschetta the most. It has good cheese with chop watermelon. The meat ball also good. \n\nI like my drink with Basic Beach Cocktails. It is refreshing.

You cannot believe a side street of Holiday area has this great seafood restaurant. Local know about this place. \n\nWe start with 3-pepper crab soup. Plenty of crab meat. A bit spicy. Almost like Cajun style. We like this unique soup. We do have to send back the New England clam chowder. They taste a bit sour like vinegar. We also order a dozen of cedar key little neck. It is fresh sea taste. We t come with cocktail and butter dipping sauce. \n\nOur main dish is the blackened grouper, shrimp and scallops. The scallops is sea giant scallops. Since we close to home of scalloping, it is big and great. The shrimp come in five pieces. The grouper is good quantity. I like the Cajun blackened they use. The other dish is lobster roll. This roll I am not recommended. It has the imitation crab meat and lobster meat. I rather they use full lobster. \n\nService is a bit slow. It also can be a lot more attentive.

    "text": "Finally south Tampa has a good enough poke place. This place does the poke right. Why I said that. Because they take extra step to marinate your selected poke with add on separately. That way the poke is separate from the base and topping. \n\nFirst chose your size. Figure out how many scoop and base you want. Second chose your base. The base includes brown rice, white rice, kale slaw, or power blend. Third chose your poke protein. I will definitely go with double tuna or tuna plus salmon. Then chose you mix-in sauce. This part can get tricky because whatever you chose is on you. I usually chose multiple sauces in sweet side and poke sauce which is a bit salty. I also like it to go with green onion and cilantro. I wish they can add the corn, edamame, cucumber in the mix-in. It will be better. Why include as topping. \n\nThe great thing of this place is the have many toppings with fruit items which I like. Price wise is above average. But the have good sauce choice at the end. If use multiple sauce at the mix-in section, you may want warn them ahead so they don't put the first sauce too much become unbalanced. Good luck for the mix-in. If you afraid you will fail on the sauce choice, try their pre set poke.",

    "text": "I like Thali Plate. And this restaurant has it. Thali mainly South Indian food. It is a meal with multiple dishes. The biggest thali can consist of 45 dishes which is call Kutumb. We don't have it in Tampa. At least the Thalia here have 9 dishes. Considering it is big enough. \n\nI order the non veggies thali. It has tandoori chicken, goat curry, chicken butter curry, chick pea curry, sweet rice pudding, mango lassi, rice, nan, and veggies. They have good take out box to contain this thali. I was surprised they have compartment to fill. I think the take home portion is smaller compared to eat it there. The mango lassi is good. I like the goat curry and the tandoori chicken. \n\nThe preparation will take minimum 30 minutes. So call ahead is a good ideal. The food is delicious but the portion for take out is small.",

This is the first in Tampa Bay Area. \n\nThe cookie selection is simple. The flavor did change time to time. We got the peaches N' cream and milk chocolate chip. Both cookies are good. The peaches N' cream is serve chill. The cream is very good. The milk chocolate chip serve warm. It is also good when you eat it at parking lot. \n\nPlease remember there are two types of serving cookie. Chill or warm. You might want to know. The smaller cookie only for catering menu. Mostly the sugar cookie. They do have cream and drink if you like.",

Wawa is running the special on the drink. 16 oz drink only $2. Good deal. I got the peach banana smoothie with whip cream. We also got the chocolate cookie and cream Creamy smoothie. Those are very good. I also have their flurricanes. This is salt caramel with mixed of the crust cookie in it. Very interesting.  Go there before run out of promotion. The 24 oz only $3.

    "text": "Meat Market have a good thought on the food and decoration of the dining hall. It is hip looking upscale dining experience with a few things to offer. We were on the first round of multi restaurants happy hour tour. Meat Market was our first stop and did not disappoint us. I like the out side seating, bar area and the dining hall. They do provide heat lamp if you sit close to outside. \n\nI start with a Quatro Verde. This cocktail has illegal mezcal, ancho reyes, and basil. It is a good cocktail with great alcohol in it. It worth the money. The chef start with complimentary spicy corn. It was great to go with the alcohol drink. The appetizers we got is roasted escargot. Each chamber has at least two escargot which is why they charge high price to make up the value. The next appetizer is the wood grilled Churrasco and fries. The steak is good quality with good fries. This is most expensive item in the appetizers. I would expect better. But still good. \n\nOverall the bar service started too slow. Need to pay attention to customer. After they engaged, everything is good.",

    "text": "Finally Pinellas has shot chicken place. This place is better than the one in Tampa. This hot chicken place are having their own building and drive through. I would said they are not quite organized yet. The menu definitely will make the first timer scratch their head. Because the order need three steps. First choose type of chicken, then the heat or spicy, then the side. This usually take time to make one order. As a result, it is slow to order if only one register open. This need to change. It need minimum two registers all time until their customers know immediately what they want. \n\nThe food is cook to order. So you need to be patient and wait. It is worthy to wait because it is good. I like the coating, flavor, and good pieces of chicken. We have chicken & waffle and quarter dark. The waffle was well made. The strip is well marinated. I like my quarter dark better because it has great coating. I got the hot level.  It is good heat.",

The restaurant is well decorated. I like the new space. \n\nWe were here for their lunch special. Two roll with soup or salad is $11. It is a good deal. The restaurant is kind of empty. It need good promotion for the local Carrollwood to attract more customers. We got the two roll with Atlantic and Tokyo Rolls. The Atlantic roll is very nice. It is a Striped Bass with imitation crab meat and lemon slice. The lemon slice enhances the flavor. I would recommend this roll. The Tokyo roll has tuna and yellow tail mixed. The spicy sauce make it very nice. \n\nOur next dish is the baked mussels. But I like this dish better at YBOR because they bake till crisp on the top. Nonetheless, it is good big pieces of mussels. We also got the tempura bento box. The tempura is not measured up because they just dip the wet batter and fried. They did not add the tempura while fried to make it hairy. \n\nOverall is a good visit. Good service.",

I finally have a chance to visit and this place find it very affordable. This review for Mike M and Arlene. \n\nI know the restaurant is very close to my badminton gym. However, I was not able to visit after or before the games. I have to make a special trip for this restaurant. When arrive at this restaurant at 4:45, I was thinking we must be the first customer for the early arrival. I was surprised there were so many car in front already. Either I am really late or this is a popular place. Soon enough we founded out the early bird started from 2 to 5 pm daily. We beat the clock with 3 minutes to spare for the early bird. The early bird menu entrees are less than $9 except the steak dish for $14. What a steal. The people who dine there average age are at least 10 year older than me. I am just a young chicken when I was among them. \n\nWe have ordered the coco loco tilapia and stuffed tilapia. Then we look at their regular menu, we have order the Rockefeller oyster of six for $9. I also spot a before 6 pm margarita for $3. Our total include tax an tip is less than $35. Wow. This food may not excited you but it had a awesome value. Oysters is great when came out from the grilled. Love it. I like the shredder coconut on the tilapia. It come with two side. The stuff tilapia is not bad at all. Although it do not have the wow factor, it is fresh and good. \n\nThe margarita has full loaded alcohol. Usually if I got the discounted margarita, I fell dilute juice at the last melt drink. But the margarita here is strong. I will come to check them again since my wife also like it.",

The au Poivre sauce is brandy cream sauce with mushroom. The brandy adds the enhancement and sweetens the sauce and brown the mushroom. It is very very good. The steak is the top Sirlion season with kosher salt and fresh ground pepper. It makes the exterior of the meat crispy. The steak company very well with the au Poivre sauce. The steak is well pick from the market and they are very tender. \n\nThe restaurant certainly has the food with good pricing. The only thing they really need to improve is the interior. The table, chair, lamp, and interior need to have makeover. They are too old and some table side is sticky. The food is 5 stars but the interior only allow me to award 4 stars.",

I love the skin with rich mojo spice. It was so good. \n\nSometime they run special item such as Tropichop. First step pick your meat - mojo pork, chicken pincho, Calypso Beef. Then add your base such as rice, lettuce or yellow rice. Then top with type of veggie, then added your sauce. Sound easy. This special is running now. I would go for typical grilled chicken with mojo spice. \n\nWe have good coupon two order for $10. Can beat it. The salsa and spicy sauce can be pick up on the sauce island. In fortunately there was no Pollo Tropical in new Tampa area. I have travel far to get it if I am craving for it.",

I was able to locate one since I have been to the first watch near USF. \n\nMy friend is a picky eater and he is not a vegan but he watches his diet carefully. It is challenging when one of your group people want a clean diet food. I only can think a few choices. We are great able to accommodate his need. I saw the first thing he has order is the kale tonic. It is kale, cucumber, lemon and Fuji Apple. Very healthy. No sugar added. The trick is always adding some type of fruit to sweeten it up. In this case is Fuji Apple. The lemon is to add the twist of the taste. Nice touch. \n\nThis afternoon I have the smoke Salmon and Roasted Vegetable Frittata. It has the roasted shallots and tomatoes in the egg that create the sensation of the taste. Good touch. It also has some chive in there to enhance the taste. It serves with ciabatta toast and sweet jam. \n\nWe have 5 people in our group but we are in and out the restaurant in 45 minutes.

It is for good taste, ingredients conscious healthy living, good price. Ciccio do have all the qualities above. \n\nWe order three items to share. The first is the daily special island poke. This dish has seared rare tuna, blacken pineapple, edamame, mango over the sticky rice. Nice combination with sweet ginger sauce. It is good dish. The only thing I don't like is chop up seared Tuna. I will prefer is slice and better presentation with slice. \n\nOur second dish is Thai Grilled Steak Bowl. It has lettuce, cilantro, mango, carrots, fried wonton skin. I like the grilled steak. I don't like the hard raw carrot. It doesn't go with the dish. \n\nOur third dish is Spicy Thai chicken. I like this dish because it has mushrooms and stir fried noodle. The stir fried is good. Although it is American style but is still quite good.",

This may be the reason they are 4 cents cheaper than most gas station around there. \n\nThey have 20 pumps for gas. So there not much of waiting. There is plenty of room to maneuver you car around the pump station. The convenience store has hotdog, cold or hot drinks, quick snack and more.

This is my first dinner to actually eat at David Island. \n\nWe have Pollo Al Forno w/ Lemons and Pollo Margherita. The Pollo Al Forno w/ Lemons is roast chicken with Italian herb. When the menu said with lemon, it actually with lemon Italian tomato base sauce. If I know it ahead I may change my mind because I don't like sour food. Nonetheless, the chicken is great. I think the potatoes can be smaller pieces for all the herb. The chicken Margherita was a great dish. It has all bell and whistle for the farm to table item. The chicken is pounded and breaded with right crust. It sauce is amazing. I would definitely go for this dish. Very pleasant to enjoy this dish. \n\nThe service is great. The only thing for the restaurant is not much choice on the protein side. Only chicken, sausage, meat ball. It will be difficult to grab hold on the the customers to visit from out side of David Island. Don't get me wrong, this is good restaurant.",

You can get it here. \n\nI am here actually for their 20% of store space. They have back alley kitchen restaurant. They do have two tables. I got the lechon and halo-halo. Unfortunately the lechon grill is not what I imagine roast pig. But is similar to Chinese crispy pork. However I like their dipping sauce. The brown sweet sauce is complimented the crispy pork. \n\nThe halo-halo is definitely an item to have. They have many ingredients below with ice cream on top. Great drink for summer. Sweet and savory. I like their purple grain. It is enjoyable bite in the drink. \n\nOne thing to improve is the store only one person. When you have long line in front of you might as well go to other restaurant. Because the wait is long. For my next visit, I like to try their Daing Fish fried.",

We got the Vongole pasta. It come with seven clams, spaghetti with white wine and garlic clam sauce. Hint, I did not feel much of wine sauce. I like this dish because it is light. Great for older customers who don't like heavy sodium or sauce. The second dish we have is the Lemon Butter Salmon. This dish has pan sear salmon.

    "text": "Flames Indian Restaurant is one of the up coming Indian cuisine at south Tampa. The cuisine does tone down a bit for the local American. It is still maintained a good spice mixture that represents the Indian cuisine. The decorations of the restaurant is nice. While we eating there, there are some local come to pickup the take out. \n\nWe have the Phatthar Gosht Ka Saalan. It is a lamb dish from Hyderabadi Cuisine. This dish to me the spice is enough. However I think missing the heat of the spiciness. It has s still delicious. \n\nI like the most is the Chicken Chettinad. It is a classic chettinad dish with great flavor. I like the sophisticated of the spice. It is great dish to go with rice. \n\nBoth dishes is good. Portion is a bit small. Service at the restaurant is good. If you not use to the spicy Indian foods, this may be a good choice. They do have good taste.",

A three step process to select what you want. \n\nFirst step is to choose the your entree. This includes burritos, quesadilla, bowl, taco. Next step is to choose your protein, it includes different types of chicken, pork, steak or ground beef, shrimp. Base on type of protein will determine the price of the items. Next step to choose your add on. They have good choices. I got the steak quesadilla. The add on was delicious. It take 10 minutes to prepare my thick quesadilla. It has good cheese.

    "text": "This is our second stop happy hour restaurant. Malio is restaurant near Curtis Hixon park. If you happen to be there, you may want to check on their happy hour from 3 to 7 pm Tuesday to Friday. Their happy hour food item is great. \n\nI start with their high west old fashioned. It is a double Rye whiskey. It has some kick into it. Good deal at happy hour. Our selection for the appetizers begins with filet tips it was grilled very well. Good to share with friend. Our next appetizer is Ahi Tuna Tartare. It serve with wonton chip and pickles ginger. Tuna was good. Our last appetizer is the Shrimp Theresa. It is grilled shrimp with ponzu crispy outside. I like this appetizer the best. It come as six pieces. \n\nOverall we enjoy our time here. Service is good. Parking at the building is $6 if you want to park close. They do have coupons but still need to pay $6 for parking. I think it defeated the coupon.",
