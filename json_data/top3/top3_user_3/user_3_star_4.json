Their chocolate is very soft and tasty. \n\nIn Tampa, the International Plaza Mall has this temporary store from Thanksgiving to Easter. They located very close to H&M clothing store. You can have samples before you buy it. I got the lollipop candies. I also bought one assorted chocolate candies. They are very good. The store clerk was kind enough to let us try their assorted chocolate other their typical sample candies. \n\nYou can go with chocolate with nut, mint, toffee, milk, white or dark chocolate. All are good. Guilty pleasure with a touch at sweet side. Mail order through the web also available. If you close to the mall, just go to buy one without shipping.",

I always find a 40,000 mile warranty tire here and change them almost every two year or more since tire do not last. What is the point to buy the good tire. The tire may be miss alignment once you hit the curb unintentionally. \n\nThey tire plus here have the life time alignment and balance if you buy the tire here. I already got my money worth since I have been here for more than tree time due to their life time program.  I suggest you do the same. Right now they have the tire in 59 minutes or you are free program if you make appointment. A smart way to come here is to make appointment and there is less wait. \n\nThey have wifi if you want to bring your computer while you wait for your car. Other than oil change, tire, and tune up please go to your dealer.",

From the old projected TV to digital large screen TV. The renovation is welcoming the patron to the new football season. \n\nI like to come to this restaurant mainly is their chicken wings. First, select the way you want it - Grill, breaded, wet sauce, or boneless. Second, select number of wings. Third, select the flavor. Tonight we have tried 12 different flavors. My top three I like most are grill chipotle BBQ, grill Thai chili, and the grill Yucatan. If you dare, try their 4 alam wings. This wing is super hot that one of our friends tries it and burn the mouth. I also like the peanut butter flavor with unique taste. \n\nThis sport bar is family oriented bar. Many families bring their kids. They have the children menu. The restaurant service is good and the food came out fast with 100 wings.",

This bar has many musicians performed here before. This is my first time to Independent and I like it due to their crazy bar tender. Nothing better to sat at the bar and see all the drink fly out from the bar. Sometimes you can chat to your neighbor and enjoy the music. I like it not too loud but the music is still can be appreciated. \n\nThey have some of bar food and good selection of local draft beers. I like it they post the percentage of the content of alcohol.

So it has more items than regular Walmart. \n\nStart with grocery. They have bakery, fresh produce, deli, meat and seafood, frozen section and many more. Price is acceptable. I like the Parmesan chicken wing. This is my favorite in the deli section. I like the cream pop at the frozen section. They do have Ahi tuna grade fillet. It good for seared or sushi. \n\nDaily product includes clothing, sport items, electronic, art and craft, bicycle, jewelry, and more. I like the most is their eye glass center, you can get good pair of glass with lesser price with insurance cover. The pant and shock is my frequent item. \n\nThe pharmacy has the beauty product I need, it also has my daily care product like tooth paste, shampoo and mouthwash. Well.

However, they have killer wings. \n\nIf you come to this bar, try their wings. Many of the Tampa Bay Area wings are deep fried and sauce. I really don't like that way to prepare the wings. I prefer you either add a step like grilled it, marinated over night or breaded with flavor coating. This restaurant take a step further, the wings are marinated, slow smoke then baked per the menu. I think they at lease marinated with dry coating. I like their wings. Please try my favorite Parmesan and lemon pepper. You might want to look at their daily special combination that will save you some money including a game of pool. \n\nThe place has some draft beer dispensers on the left of counter that is not visible. So, please look for all local draft before order. The place is three stars base in ambient and furniture. The wing is five stars. I would say this is a 3.5 stars place. I am giving them 4 stars since there is no half star.",

As a result you can time your meal before the flight. \n\nThe restaurant is affordable compare to any seafood restaurant in New Orleans. We have order a dozen of raw oysters and they are only $8. It came with reddish and cocktail sauce. The oysters are fresh and big. \n\nThe main course is the blacken catfish with Creole sauce with rice.  The catfish in New Orleans is great no matter which restaurant we went to. This restaurant also has the good catfish. I like the Creole sauce with smaller size shrimp in tomato base sauce. \n\nThe second dish is grilled tuna skew over rice Creole sauce. The tuna is assembling in the skew along with shrimp, onion, and bell pepper. The tuna is lightly season and grilled open flame. The shrimp along the skew is not as fresh as the tuna. The dish presentation is impressive with skew bridge over the Creole rice. \n\nThe service is good. The restaurant may need to renovate to newer furniture.

    "text": "Tonight is happy night to see my pal. Over the weekend I was able to meet up with Anna. But today I am meeting with three yelpiest friends to try the 7 course beef dish from my last review. \n\nI have seven beef dishes on other Vietnamese restaurant before. The first course is the raw slice beef in the vinegar onion broil. Then beef is wrapping in rice paper with veggie. The sauce inside the wrap can be hoisin sauce and dip it on the fish sauce.\n\nThe second course is herb marinated slice beef to be cooked in butter. Then it is wrapping with rice paper with vermicelli. The third course is the slice beef in peanut. The first three courses require some work to wrap it. Some is skill with the wrap. The trick is not to over fill with material. \n\nThe fourth course is the ground beef in tea leave. The ground beef is marinated then grill on the frying pan. The fifth course is the beef balls with shrimp chip. The beef ball is cook with clear vermicelli. This ball can be break into pieces and pickup with the shrimp chip. With the crispy of the shrimp chip and ground beef, it create the sensation of the crispy and meat flavor. The sixth course is the Sherrard beef with porridge. It top with some fried onion and the parsley. By mixing it provide some mixture of the flavor. The seventh course is the slice pork on the outwardly roll around the raw green onion. The slice beef is marinated and grilled outwardly. This course can be improved if they caramel the onion first before the slice beefs rolling will be better. It will take away the onion spiciness. \n\nOverall the food is good but challenge. It is a good meal to have when your group likes to have the long and good conversation. It will take time to finish. The two people for the seven courses are $35 and the 3 people are $45.",

We were here for lunch and it is Wednesday. \n\nWednesday in any outback have special in their menu. I have tried their $12 three course menu. The first course is the Caesar salad. The lettuce is fresh and crispy. My entree is the glaze grilled pork tenderloin with a size. I have chosen the grilled asparagus as my side and I have added an up charge item shrimp in the Barbie. The pork was grilled wonderfully with tender meat. Each cut of the pork has preserved their juice in each piece. The shrimp is grilled and maintain the size of the shrimp. Seasoning is well prepared in this case. The tomatoes are cut to half and well cook for mouth watering enjoyment. The asparagus is not dry after grilling.  Good technique. \n\nThe third course is the carrot cake. The sweetness is well mix that not loses the ingredient taste of the carrot. This is the restaurant that I have repeated when I am go to Bartow or Orlando and need the meal before meeting.

The Spanish music play in the background with lively atmosphere. \n\nThis the first time I try Puerto Rican restaurant in USA. I have Puerto Rico cuisine at Puerto Rico before. I can said the restaurant at La Casona has interesting Puerto Rican menu. It include traditional Mofongo. Mofongo is a fried plantain-based dish from Puerto Rico. It is typically made with fried green plantains mashed together in a with broth, garlic, bit fried pork belly. It can be filled with vegetable, meat or seafood. This restaurant open since 1999. It have Spanish base customer. \n\nToday we have the seafood Mofongo and churrasco. The seafood Mofongo came with half of the lobster tail, shrimp, salty fish, muscle.  I was impress of my Mofongo serve with a bit wine base seafood broth. When you bite the olive they have cook with it, the wine juice came out and it is tasty and left wine fragrant in the mouth. This normally different than the Wikipedia description to prepare it. The broth base mix with the fried green plantain neutralize the salty of the broth. The two materials balance each other is the beauty of cooking. Good chef skill. The churrasco is ok. It can be better. Churrasco is Argentina food. Most of the time the Cuban restaurant prepare this dish better than anyone in Miami. You have choice with rice and bean or salad and sweet plantain. \n\nThe service is good and friendly. However, the close out and bring the check is slow. This restaurant customer tender to speak louder due the natural of the Spanish customer. Food is good portion. Most of time you will have enough to take home for the remained meal.",

This actually better for me that I can order the fresh items.

As a result, it creates the specialty of the restaurant with the fresh made noodle. Every Saturday weekend has fresh made dumpling. They are not frozen. They will made and cook at the spot. In winter, they cure their own meat and sell it on the February, March and April.  During that time you find the cure meat food that is not in the menu. \n\nThe secret is out. Go enjoy the beautiful bowl of soup noodle or have them cook a special cuisine for you. I will be back to try their different food.",

The first appetizer is the Hellcat Wing. The wing was fried with choice of dipping sauce. The second app is the chicken and waffle slider. The fried chicken has good coating. The waffle need some work. The third app is the wildcat shrimp. I recommend this dish with good shrimp. The fourth app is munition mussel. I like they way prepared the sauce in the mussels.

It has some dishes worth for a try. We got the Shrimp Manchuria for start. It has marinated in coating them deep fried. Lastly stir fry the chili sauce with onion and bell peppers. It has 5 to 6 large shrimps. Good appetizer dish. \n\nOur main dish are the Lamb Boti Tikka. This is cube lamb marinated in spice, yogurt, garlic and ginger. This lamb grilled in tandoor oven. I usually has the tandoori chicken. But tandoori lamb is the first. Or second dish is the Gongura Chicken with high nutrition leave and spice. This is one of traditional dish. This not typical American Indian red curry. The color is dark green. \n\nThe only complaint about the restaurant is the rice come very late after the main dish was set on the table. I don't know they try to have you eat the main dish first so you won't ask for too much rice. Curry dish need to go with rice. Although is not intentionally but execution need to be corrected.",

In Canada, they have the rare beef on the side for you to add. This is better since you don't want it to overcook. Unfortunately none of the Bay Area Vietnamese restaurants have prepared this way. The Hu Tieu Nam Vang is noddle soup with clear both with fried garlic base. I like they add the liver, quail egg, shrimp, squid and ground pork into the soup. This is a good soup when you are sick. \n\nOverall the restaurant is busy. The service is average; the waitresses are able to speak English. Food quality is great. I like the grilled quail here.

One thing for sure my wife has said is to simplify the menu call out. It is difficult for the American to call out the Lao food name and it can be easily mixed up. \n\nWe start with the chicken wings and the Laap Beef. The wing is really good coating. The laap beef has good spicy item. It is good spicy to me but my friend said is too hot for them. But the restaurant did offer to lower the spiciness at the end for my friend to take home. We also has the Thum Mua Sap Sap Style - it is the salad with vermicelli noodle, shrimp and the beef meat ball. It was delicious. I like the style. We also have the the Laotian sausage.

I feel old when I am walk in but in the same time I am juvenile myself with the younger group. \n\nThe bar has cocktails mixologist which can make some cocktails. We got the Happy Buddha Beer, hotdogs nuggets, fire that pig skin burger. This burger is burger week burger. It has Wagyu beef patty top with smoke pull pork and onion ring. It is using Texas toast as bun. Very good burger. They should keep this in their regular menu. The hot dog nuggets just like the Somali corn dog. Come with special dipping sauce. \n\nWe enjoy our time here at the bar. Service is good because we got all the attention from bar tenders. Food is good and so is the speed to deliver the food to table. The game machines is classic which is fun enough to play.",

I hope they do well. \n\nI got the full chicken with tax is about above average price grilled chicken around here. If they they can adjust a little bit for their price, may be can be more compete with neighborhood rotisserie chicken. I would said they have good marinated sauce into the meat and bone of the chicken. This I give them an A. \n\nIf you order takeout, you may want to call ahead.

It came close to the planing. \n\nThe restaurant sales Chinese BBQ food such as pork, duck, crispy pork. You can buy it by the pound. This restaurant was here before along the Ding Ho oriental grocery store. \n\nThe best value is the beef noodle soup. The beef is stir fry and then add to the soup. The soup broth is chicken and bone base. The noodle is the Hong Kong egg noodle. The are thin and great to chew. Compare to Mc Donald. I will pick the value ($5.99) of this noodle soup anytime. It is more nutrition and fun to eat. \n\nThey also serve traditional Chinese dishes. If you like fried rice try their dry scallop fried rice. It stir fried with dried scallop and slice asparagus. The other dish are the beef with Chinese broccoli with beef in hoisin source also a good dish. This dish is more to American style dish but still kept the Chinese cuisine technic.\n\nThe surprise dish is the Taro Crispy Duck. The duck is deboned and marinated. The duck meat then lay on the bottom and top paste with ground taro. They are deep fried and chop into pieces. The accommodate with sweet soy sauce and garlic and scallion. They are crispy on top and bottom. The top is a crispy taro create the net type crispy good. The bottom is duck create slightly burn crispy. This is a killer dish.",

They also have the reduce price appetizers. \n\nIt is perfect to go there when I just finish my Saturday noon time badminton session. Compare to many places with happy hour sushi, their sushi rice is seasoning with good flavor before wrapping. In my book, only one happy hour place sushi rice is comparable to this place. I got six different roll for $24. I also get half price sangria sake. Good deal. \n\nOther than their happy hour sushi, they also have chef signature sushi roll. They are very attractive. The service is good, the ambients are nice. Can you believe they are the few pioneers who serve gourmet sushi in Bay Area.",

I feel that 1 clerk is not enough. \n\nThe soft serve is by weight. But the toppings are impressive. They include hot fudge, strawberry dip chocolate, sweeten cherry, sprinkles, . Since it is by weight, the toppings become burden to weight in for additional cost.

I will encourage them to continue to strive for the best interest of customers for this matter.",

Hopefully I can give them a 5 stars next time. \n\nBefore you come to this restaurant, you need to know a few thing. 1. Do not just show up. Make a reservation. Even though they said is highly recommended, I said is a must. Almost every day for people just walk in they have to wait for 2.5 hours at dinner time. If you don't have reservation,come at the time they open. 2. Go for the menu items. They are match the value of the food. 3. Be patient. They really don't have much help on the kitchen since it always back up on the order. \n\nToday we show up with reservation and we still have to wait for our table to be ready. Not a long wait. While waiting there is a special of the day on the board for your choices. We have appetizer and pre-meal item that come with the entree. The first course is about 30 minutes. But the entree is about an hour wait. I did ask the waiter why. They have accommodated with addition wine and dessert no charge for our situation. \n\nWe begin our appetizer with Vongole Marechiara. It is the baby pasta clams saut\u00e9ed with garlic, basil, and white wine sauce. The sauce is great. Please ask a loaf of bread to go with it. It is excellent dipping the bread in this sauce. The baby clam is about 25 to 30 count. But they are small portion in the big bowl. They taste very good. \n\nMy entree is the special on the board. Pan seared blacken Scottish Salmon on top of roasted slice potato with house cure pork belly. The salmon cook just right and the fish is fresh. The cure pork belly is awesome. It is a bit pricy for this dish. The entree come with the soup or salad of your choice. \n\nThe restaurant only have the wine and beer for alcohol. We were accommodated with great dessert for the time lost while waiting. Seem like they have a smaller kitchen. This may be the only area they need to improve. Increase the speed of food preparation or bigger kitchen. Don't let the customer wait. \n\nThe dessert is magnificent. They brought out the Tiramisu, Cannoli, Lemon Cake, and pyramid chocolate. It look awesome when they are in one big plate. I applause they accommodated the customer long wait time.",

The only thing I would said, they need to work on the quantity of the food for the price paid. \n\nWe started with the two drink. My wife have the cocoa slush with boba. It is good. But I like my Caramel Macchiato Slush better. Rich in flavor. \n\nOur appetizers is the ninja nuggets. This Taiwanese street food is delicious. My wife have Mega Pork Ramen. There are charshu pork and charshu pulled pork. This may be the best value. The broth is pork bone base. I have the grilled shrimp ramen. It come with 8 pieces pan seared grilled shrimp. Both our broth is added black garlic. Extra $1 for black garlic to be added. \n\nFood is great. Measure the price to value and quantity is 4 stars.",

I give them half stars additional due to pandemic and at least reasonable pricing. \n\nThe soup base is not total pork bone base. The soup is at the light side now t too creamy. The meat just ok for their charshu. Veggie is not heavily use. The porch egg probably the item worthy. I would give their ramen C grade. \n\nThe appetizers fried shiu mai is good enough even they are not in the great category. The fried calamari is just average. Food at least is fresh to have. \n\nThe place is big enough for hosting a lot of customers. Service is good may be we are the only customer.

The wing was fried, grilled, to with cheese and Chimichurri sauce. I believe this is their best appetizer. \n\nOur entree are Basic and Lima plates and combo. For the basic we have Ropa Vieja and shredded chicken. This combo also come with yellow rice and sweet plantain. The Lima has better rice. It is Peruvian green rice, plum tomatoes and onion. The protein are Chimichurri pork, and mojo pork. \n\nService just average. But but and price are good. The happy hour is before 6:30 pm.

They have their tasty side. I like the crab and shrimp cake the most. I also like the Spicy Thai Chicken dipping sauce with sweet tangy flavor. \n\nSince we have so many appetizers, we only order one entr\u00e9e from their special - the Shrimp Diablo. It is spaghetti in red sauce with shrimp except they add a kid of spicy. I believe this dish is too plain and not exciting. I think this dish should not be served any more if they try to attract customer. The special is not special at all.\n\nOverall the service is excellent; food came out very quick since there is no other customer this late. Enjoy watching the Hokey NHL game with the TV with Tampa Bay Lighting score a goal at the buzzer to win.",

Many ladies enjoy this restaurant more than guys. If you walk in, the girls are more than the boys. It is really ladies choice of food. \n\nStacy Brown the founder and creator has her story of this restaurant of how it started. Interesting story was it. They have multiple selections of chicken salad type that will be some things for your plate. You also can sample the chicken salad before you make a choice of the ultimate salad you want. We have the jalape\u00f1o holly that day. It is tasty and good. We order chicken gourmet dish come with sandwich scoop, pasta salad and broccoli salad. I like the broccoli salad. \n\nThe interior decoration certainly the best I seen for the fast food store. They also have the small room can hold 20 people if you like to have the meeting there. Food is definitely healthy side in my book. Service is really good. I will return to this restaurant sometime soon for the chick magnet.",

With less $10 you can get a combo with drink. I have 5 taco combo for $7.50. But adding fish and shrimp taco is a dollar more. My favorite is the shrimp taco. It has very good spice for the shrimp. Very tasty for the bite. We have other tacos such as lingua, tripa, chicharon. \n\nIt use to a taco truck. Now they have permanent place with sit down restaurant which very good for the customers.

We were there at Sunday and they are not that busy and we have the table quickly. I wonder weekend and weekday is this situation. We also notice the crowd to eat here slowdown at 8:00 pm. \n\nMost of the entry is $40 and more. By the time you done for the night is about $70 per person with drink. They also have the three course prix fixe meal about $50\n\nWe started with the Ricotta Wild Mushroom Crostini with pesto and microgreens. I like the pesto and the balsamic vinaigrette dip on the side. We have our entry as the Prime New York Strip with the Scallops and the Bloomsdale Spinach - tomato, red onion, spiced bacon, almonds, fresh blueberries, cauliflower couscous, chopped egg, chevre fritter, and lemon-truffle dressing. The Bloomsdale spinach with the lemon-truffle dressing is delicious. The spiced bacon makes a twist to the spinach. The herb butter-roasted Brussels sprouts is a bit charcoal that was place below the steak. Seem like the chef did not watch the fire over the grilled. However, the herb spice work perfectly with the Brussels Sprout. The scallop also is a bit burn on the cumin-laced spice. The scallop is a great. Overall the chef needs to watch the burn food.\nWe ended with miniature Chocolate Au Cr\u00e8me with chocolate-dipped pistachio tuile cookie. The dessert is perfect. Overall the restaurant is together for the food. The service may need a bit of attention when customer is not look down and looking for them.",

It is better to go there at off hours to get a parking. At the entrance they already have some food taste. When you walk into the store, the herb plants are on the side of the entrance.

But they do carry enough material for cooking. We have bought the Seasoned Rack of Lamb (all natural), Rice drink, Seasoned Kale Chips and the Bacon end tip. The price is reasonable here compare to many place. The end tip bacon is 3.65. After remove the fat, we still have a lot left for the lean meat. The dessert tasting is provided at some time.

The reason they want appointment is to adhere the Coronavirus guidelines to limit less than 10 people in the store. As a result appointment is important. People who walk in, if the store has more than ten people, they are ask to leave and make appointment. This is an A for the store. \n\nWhile I waited, the waiting chair is set 6 feet apart. While you waited, they will come to take your touchless temperature check for fever. They also ask the series of questions if you have exposure to Coronavirus. This is an A. \n\nBefore you get up to select your glasses frame, they ask you to wear the gloves before touch any glass frame. The frame you touch, they ask you not to put it back. They also disinfect each table counter before new customers. This prevention method should be use for next phrase business opening. Each employee wearing mask. \n\nDuring this difficult time, this business done a very good job.",

For all the food we have tasted, other than the grilled meat, the rest of the item are well prepared. I have not try their Jungsik yet - combination of everything. That will be my list next time. \n\nWe have group today to try the Korean marinated fried chicken, bibimbob, Kimbab, Seafood Soon-doobu. The best of the night is the Korean marinated fried chicken. The marinated sauce is very interesting. It has the good mixed into the fried chicken. I also like the Soon-doobu. It is soft tofu stew in hot pot. It come very temperature hot with bubble boiling hot. Nice mix of seafood inside. Soft to taste. Bibimbob is rice assembly with beef in hot stone pot. \n\nOverall is very good. Not a wow factor but definitely above average. Very close to Korean street food.",

Strawberry and raspberry is red and fresh looking. I also like their cheap wine selection for cooking. The hot deli is great. \n\nI like aisle is big and wide.

They should always improve on the number of checkout cashiers. Because the faster they checkout, the wait to enter the store will be faster.",

Although they have few thing need to be improved, this restaurant is a promising restaurant to make it. \n\nWe have group of 5 and the we were second group there because we arrive before 11:30 am just to avoid the wait of previous Yelper comment. I have order the grilled pork chop lunch special and our group each have different dish - pad Thai, Pad see wee, stir fry beef. This very much to try different skill of the chef. My order was not correct provided. They bought out the grilled beef instead of pork chop. I ask them not to change it. The grilled beef is perfect grilled. The chef paid attention on the grilled. My friend their stirred fry dish. \n\nA few things need to improve is read the order back to customer to make sure order is right. Remember the drink order to be bring out and don't wait for customers to remind the server. Lunch hour need to be quick on response because most of the people need to get back to work.",

It is great to view the sunset from here while enjoy your meal. It can be good romantic date night spot. \n\nThere is live music on the outside deck area. Tonight we started with coconut shrimp and Calamari which are in the happy hour items. They also have the pork Slider for the special. The Calamari is below average. The coconut shrimp and pork Slider is better. \n\nMy entr\u00e9e is the grilled hog snapper. This dish come as whole fish and debone the center fish bone. Very good chef skill to maintain the whole fish without bone. The fish is like butterfly cut and grilled in blacken.  If they use the Cajun blacken will be more superior. Anyhow, this is already a good dish and come with broccolini and top with salsa. \n\nThe service can be improved. Pay more attention to the table will be great. Occasionally check need to be often. This about 3.5 stars in my book.",

The lengua is the cow tongue. \n\nThe only complaint I have is they need to caramelized a bit will make it better.  My wife like the most is carnitas. It is sherrard or simmering pork.

I think it is ok dish too. \n\nThe service is just ok. To get attention of the waiter is a bit challenging. They need to improve on it. I did get a the great escape on the cocktail. I actually like this cocktail. Pineapple fuse with rum. Nice touch.",

Fried seafood is one of their favorite food. Parking is kind of limited. The seat down table also limited if you want to eat there. Many people ordered to go.  \n\nWe got the fried conch as appetizer. This is my first time to have fried conch. The coating is good. We also got the oyster and fish combo box. The oyster is in good pieces. We like the fried shrimp. It was delicious. The fish can have a choice like Basa, tilapia, salmon or mullet. For fried food I like to eat it there. \n\nThere is a wait after ordering. I don't mind with fresh fried seafood. It is good to eat there instead of take home.",

This restaurant is actually at Waters Ave with a lot Vietnamese cuisine. But it hold it own. \n\nMost Brazilian place like to sale you all you can eat meat. This place is more like home cooking with platter. We have the Grilled Picanha and steak with onion. The steak with onion is marinated and grilled. It is good dish and we paid less than $10. Good deal. The Picanha Steak is a bit different in cut. Since has bit skin and fat, it make the steak juicier. \n\nThe side is exiting. We have fried egg, vinaigrette, and fried ground yuca with bacon. The grounded yuca is like crump with bacon go very well with the steak. This is very traditional way by spreading this crump over the steak. And it work very well. \n\nOverall the service is good. I like this mom and pop shop. Please visit them.",

Normal ice cream price. \n\nNext time I will go for crepe with gelato. The crepe is $3.50. Adding gelato is additional $3.00.

    "text": "This Greek restaurant is a chain that just open in New Tampa a year ago. They are best system restaurant in this area. What I mean of that is from the time they receive the order to deliver the food is usually on target. Normally for the grilled food is taken more time especially for the kebab. They have enough man power and operation to make the assembly look easy and fast. Our foods deliver in 10 minutes and they are faster than any mini restaurant. I will not call this fast food since the foods are cook to your order. The cook is well train to shorten the time of deliver. \n\nTonight we have order on the light side of the menu. By the time we have added on the additional skew, it is not in the light side any more. We have order the lamb kebab and the chicken kebab and added a skew of steak kebab. Good value for dinner under $25 and use the yelp free drink offer by the restaurant. With the coupon, we have the reduction $5 of the total bill. \n\nThe kebab came with the side Greek salad and rice. It also comes with pita bread. The Greek salad is very flavorful. It has a potato salad in the middle of all the mix green (lettuce, tomato, red onion, beets, Kalamata olives, pickle green pepper, cucumber). The soft feta cheese is sprinkle over it. Lovely cheese. The skew meats (chicken, lamb and steak) are marinated and cook over the open grilled. They are will balance spice with Middle Eastern flavor. Taste sensation. I like the steak skew the best. If you take the meat from skew, the flavor stick in the finger with finger licking good. \n\nThe restaurant has small capacity seating. I like the kitchen crew shaving the Gyro with electric ring cutter. It was smoothly shave. Most of the gyro is shaving by knife which has no control of the thickness. This restaurant using the electrical shave has control over the thickness and allows crispiness. I don't like shave it too thick and cause the smell of the lamb Gyro. Technology has improved on food process. Like it.",

This is a restaurant that next to the market. It has cute interior decoration. The restaurant is close at 8 pm which mean we have to get to the restaurant before 6:30 pm. \n\nWe have order two appetizers and 3 main entrees. The first appetizer is the chicken satay. Although the satay is not on the skewer but it have the typical yellow ginger spice for the seasoning. The peanut sauce is sweet instead of mild hot for the dipping. The chicken is well grilled and not dry out the meat. The second appetizer is the dumpling. The dumpling in Chinese is sui mei. The pork dumpling is usually three part components of ground pork, ground or mince shrimp and mince water chest nut. This restaurant serves with two part shrimp and ground pork over slice ginger. You have to eat it with the ginger overlay the dumpling and increase the sophisticate of the taste which this restaurant has provided.\n\nThe first main dish is the Tom Yum with mince and slice pork noodle soup. I have asked for the Thai hot.  I can see Nick need a lot of water after he has the dish. I have my head sweat flowing while I am eating. It is sweat good. The mince pork prepare correctly with seasoning ground pork. The second dish is the pad thai. The dish is served with peanut sauce and three jumbo shrimps. The price of this dish is in the high side, however, the three jumbo shrimps make up for the price. This dish is OK. The third dish is the pan seared sea bass. This dish come with fillet sea bass over the soy sauce and accompany with the black bean rice. The sea bass is seared but a little dry. However, it is well season.\n\nOverall our experience is great. The service is a bit slow. However, after all other customers left, we were served in full attention. Tonight, we did not have a chance to try the lemongrass cr\u00e8me brule since they don't have it. This may be the item to try next time.",

I would go for that since the cost is 2 dollars to 2 dollars and 50 cents per taco. I loves place like this very affordable and provides you a good taste. Although they have other main dish menu, I would recommend just the taco. I have the fish, steak, pork and beef tongue taco. Beef tongue??? There is no such word. Just use Cow Tongue. I actually like that taco.\n\nWe have the food to go but it is still good at home after three hours. Be careful about the hot sauce. If you not use to it, it will burn your mouth.

Senor T's is close by so I can try their food. \n\nOver the phone I have order the DrunkenGrille Shrimp. It is 10 grilled shrimp on the skew with cilantro rice, slice avocado and a choice of bean to accompany it. The lady who take my order said is 10 minutes to pick up. When I arrive, the food is ready. It is well presented in the box. So the next thing is to taste it. The food is great. Better than I imagined with the stars they got. \n\nI have joke with the lady when I pickup. I said her face is red that she got it from my \"drunken\" shrimp. I need make sure she did not eat my shrimp before hand to me. She was shock in the moment and don't know to answer. I said I got her on speechless. \n\nThe overall service to pick is on target. I event got a chip and salsa to go along. The salsa is great. Cinco De Mayo have special performance from the band.",

Also, they have direct parking access to second level of the mall. \n\nIt always take me minimum 40 minutes to finish the mall. They have the skate rink that I enjoy to watch while the the patron skate. Especially those who has skill. The anchor stores include Macy's, Dillard, JC Penny  and Sear which sometimes have bargained items. \n\nOther specialty store like CC Boutique, Build a Bear Workshop, Morrow fine candy, Teavana are good to try. They have the Cobb cinema for enjoyment and Urgent Care in case you need it. \n\nThe food court and restaurant are good to try. I like the food court food sampling before you make up your mind.

Normally I need four taco to fill me up, but here just need three. In the sense it is about equal price. \n\nI have the the chorizo with shrimp, Carne asada, and pastor. The best is the Pastor and the least like is the shrimp with chorizo. I wish their shrimp can grilled a little more. The pastor certainly has a lot of flavor. Each piece of meat is grilled. Each taco has two corn tortillas. They top with veggie with dice tomato. I also has a pineapple Jarritos drink. Good and cold in this hot weather. \n\nOverall the experience is good. But if you want to try more taco choice, you have to paid more.",

I have looking for many places and try to buy and slice myself but was not successful. The cappacuolo here is bit spicy and is in good taste. I always orders my sandwich just cappacuolo, lettuce, tomato, and the secret ingredient - bacon!!! I like to order them in wheat bread and spice up my sandwich Mike's way - oil, red vinaigrette, salt, pepper, and mike secret spice. No other thing added such as mayo. This is YUM. \n\nThe sub menu also has the club supreme, original Italian, roast beef and provolone, the super sub. Other than the sub I like above, I like the super sub which is No. 5 sub. Provolone, ham, prosciuttini and cappacuolo and I alway add bacon. This is the restaurant after I have greasy food the night before and I come here to redeem myself. Interesting to said I am redeem with two strip of bacons. \n\nOther than the cold sub, they also have hot sub such as Steak Philly, big kahuna cheese steak, meat ball, chicken Parmesan, Reuben , chipotle. Lake many sub store start adding the frito chip to create crunchy feeling. I think this direction has ruined many year of tradition.",

They do have the bar section to wait before you sit. \n\nI have the champon ramen. This supposed to must try ramen. They are $16 is most expensive in the Bay Area. The soup base is good not the best in Bay Area. However, the taste is make up with the accompanying ginger tempura, fried sesame seed and other items make this soup better than most ramen restaurant. I have to said this is not the traditional way of ramen material for pork belly or grilled shrimp. However, it has good flavor. The pork belly do have the three part harmony (skin, fat, meat) cooking. In fact I like their way. The shrimp is great with good touch of marinated and grilled. \n\nThe reason they are 4 stars are as below: 1. I was there at the 5 pm starting the dinner service. The restaurant is empty and they decided call in group by group and take 15 minutes. Ridiculous!  They can go in all the first group to fill the restaurant and they choose not. 2. If you paid $16 dollars for they most like-able ramen, why they don't include all combination include the fermented egg, seaweed, bacon. This is top dollar bowl already. 3. If the price is the most pricy among the ramen restaurant, why we have to sit on stool. Put some comfortable chair please. This is America not Japan. Even in Japan they have seat with back support except the bar counter area. \n\nThis is not to put down a restaurant but a lesson and opinions for the restaurant to improve. Food is good. When the honeymoon period is over, they need to think how to get the customer for revisit. Food is 5 stars.",

I like the end piece of of the tentacles. It has the most flavor. This octopus was marinated good. I like the octopus ink that was cook at below. Well done dish. \n\nThe service is good. The speed of the food delivery need to be faster.",

It is open air taco place with a roof over the taco trailer. Good thing that many open air taco place do not have it is a place to wash your hand before handle the taco. They have the running water sink you can wash your hand. \n\nWe have ordered three tacos - Pastor, Carnitas, and the Steak taco. The best is the steak taco. It come with seasoning and pan grilled. The carnitas is tasty also. Their shredded pork was marinated. They have single corn tortillas which may break easily. The bottle opener affix the the trailer need to replace since it is rusted. \n\nOverall our experience here is good. They have some room to improve. Their green hot sauce that go with the taco stand out.",

Personally, I like whole fish to eat and left only the bone. With that said, their brand is to have good seafood. I always have good respect for this restaurant. \n\nWe start with corn chowder with lump crabmeat. The chowder is great. However I would suggest saut\u00e9ed the crab meat which will make this soup more superior. \n\nOur entr\u00e9e are the grilled red fish. This very good dish. It is not in the regular menu. Redfish is bit harder to catch. The meat definitely is nice and good. It is accompanied the string green bean and crawfish etouffee. This is very excellent dish. \n\nOur next entr\u00e9e is sirloin and crab cake. I like the crab cake but the sirloin is average. It come with two side and I have crab fried rice. Again, the crab meat need to include in the fried rice while they stir fry. Not added with broil lumb crab meat. \n\nThe service is great. It has seamless coordination.",

It is close to 4.5 stars for the way they have prepared the food. I like is very much. The reason they are 4 stars is the quantity they have served in the dinner time. Their portion is small for the dinner. But some people just eat a lot of rice with curry sauce. \n\nIf I come to the buffet, I may have rate them 5 stars. We have the Fish Molee and the Beef Malabar Curry. The fish is Basa and fried first before the curry. Love the turmeric, green chili, ginger and coconut milk. This is a good dish to enjoy because the coconut curry is out of the wold. \n\nThe beef malabar is good spice. We east the meat and take the sauce home. It is still good to enjoy with the rice. The spice is deep touch with nice medium spicy curry.",

But worth a try. \n\nThe selection of beer is good. I like the Diddy. It is a German Pilsner. The selection includes other like Lager, Stout, Cider, sour beer, wheat beer, bock, IPA, and Ale.

A free water station will help. The food need to have more flavor. I think their food is too flavorless. Sauce should be a selection instead of pair with each bowl. Let customers choose the sauce. Square box is difficult to nix the food at corner of box. However I like the presentation of food in square box. Food has less salt or sweetness. Most customers like a better taste bud.

The baby Bok Choy and black sticky rice. My mom use to cook the dark sticky rice in the process of porridge and add the coconut extract. The chef here cooks the black sticky rice with kimchi. The taste is very sophisticate. The Bok Choy was stir fry and grill it is good. The tuna actually go well with the sweet soy sauce reduction.

Good concept, but I prefer they are in the control environment. I mean out of customer contact.

In comparison, this is a small one but it has the best need for outdoor activities. They are selling the larger item such as boat to waders. Any kind of fishing needs, they have the largest selection. They also have hunting, clothing, camping, shoe section. \n\nI always get exciting about pro shop is the fresh water fish tank. The fish here is a bit tiny compare to other pro shop. The reason behind is they need to have room to grow. \n\nToday is the day after the opening and they already run out the size of the waders I want. I am buying this wader for bridge inspection when I need to walk to shallow water bridge. I have to order online. I see they display better recreation boat in Missouri store and they are cheaper there. The Tahoe recreation boat here does not have nice color design. Not as attractive as other store. (I am not talking about fishing boat). \n\nThe hunting section is interesting. You can see gun display for hunting. You also can find the chair strap to tree trunk high up for bow and arrows hunting. \n\nOverall I like this store. Same as all the Pro Shop, they have a restaurant section for the food. I was told by the server is an hour and 40 minutes wait at 6:30. We did not try it yet. The salt water tank is still under pH balance. No Fish. I will be back to try the restaurant later.",

I usually do not paid attention to those. However, they also have many choices in the menu in Peruvian side. \n\nWe have order the Ceviche de Pescado to start. It was good Ceviche with raw fish in lemon juice. Not too sour. Our entrees are the Bisteck a la Parrilla (Grilled Steak) and the Arroz con mariscos (Seafood in creole rice). The steak is just ok average. The seafood is something. It has the shrimp, squid, octopus, mussels. It is good when they are together. \n\nFood is good and the service is on point. I have the cicha moranda for the drink. You can feel is home made not from the can. Good enough sweetness. I like this purple corn drink.",

Although they are filling but after two sub is enough. \n\nThe promotion is from 4pm to 8 pm  that day. I applaud to them even there is a sale, they did run out of material. The sales item include ham , tuna, roast beef, Italian, veggies sandwich. They also did slow down because of sales. The line build up to outside of the door with 20 to 30 people at the line but the wait is less than 10 minutes. \n\nRoast beef is ok but the Italian sub is bit above averages. This is about 3.5 stars. But because they did not deny people at the door or make you wait, I gave them additional half star round up. The people behind the counter always smiling. Good customer service.",

Good choice of ingredients for your selection to be mixed. The ice cream certainly mix it correctly over the frozen stone on the counter. Clerks very friendly on this this store they also very polite. \n\nI have the banana caramel. It has nut and bananas in the mixed. The only downside is melt quickly after mixed.

I like the one with saffron and screw pine. This rice need to slowly cook. Today not many restaurants have the time to cook it over long period of time. Actually the longer you cook, the spice embedded deeper. \n\nThe Biryani rice here is above average, not on the top. But they are one of the items that I like in this buffet. The buffet is $9.95. It is a good deal when you have the chicken and the goat dish in the selection.  If you like meat dish, they have more selection compare to most Indian buffet are gear to the veggie material. \n\nThe restaurant is good. The buffet never runs out.

The restaurant have small capacity for the sitting, I can predicts they are going to get busy due to the affordable pricing and good food. Try it now while you can get sit easily. \n\nToday we only try a very little section of the menu. The menu has two pages. They have offer the pho, Hu Tieu southern Vietnam noodle soup, stir fry noodle, vermicelli, fried rice, and the special. They also have variety of appetizers. \n\nWe have order the pork skin roll, pork sausage roll, roasted quails and southern Vietnam combination (Hu Tieu). The pork skin roll is wrapping like a fresh roll with peanuts and pork skin. This is a blend taste fresh roll. The pork sausage roll is also a fresh roll with charbroil pork sausage. The pork is well grilled and has a wonderful taste. I like this roll. \n\nThe roast quails are not the best in the Bay Area but they are excellent dish. The dish come with salt and pepper on the side which I think you can eat without it. The quail smell good and I always eat with my fingers. \n\nThe southern combination noodle soup is in clear broth. This is not pho but it is wonderful dish and very light. It is good for people who are in weight watching. The noodle is the medium size egg noodle. The soup come with combination seafood and slices pork. \n\nOverall the experience is good. The service is good also. The waiter and waitress are still learning the menu. I will be back for the second page menu.",

I would recommend you give them a visit. I cannot a non Philippine chef can perform well on those cuisine. I did communicate with the chef and he has spent some time in Philippine. \n\nOur first dish is the sisig taco and qwek qwek. The sisig is braise pork belly and shoulder. The qwek qwek is the quail eggs battered and fried. The put three in the skew. Very interesting food. \n\nOur main dish is the Bicol Express. This dish is dice pork shoulder stew coconut milk and shrimp paste. The sauce very similar to adobo. Our second dish is the flying pig. I would recommend this dish. This dish has 12 hour braise pork and top with sriracha sauce. The best thing is the the 63 degree egg on top. Very good. \n\nThe restaurant is like cafeteria type. Order at counter and bring it to the table.",

It shows case the hard hit recover and the good southern food. \n\nThis restaurant can be reached by car or Taxi. This restaurant is busy sometime that the owner put a sign not to block the door during the high traffic. Today they did not have seafood. So we have order the famous fried chicken and the smothered veal. The veal came with gravy and bone in beef and a choice of side - the fried okra. The veal is braised to folk tender. The taste is amazing. The fried Chicken is the southern style. The side that we chose is the green bean gravy rice. The chicken is fried to crispy with paper thin coating. It is not like other thick coating fried chicken. The race green bean gravy is a bit spicy and it is family recipe that cannot get elsewhere. This is the side to try.\n\nWillie Mae original owner is 93 years old and past this family business to her granddaughter. Now the kitchen and the restaurant is run by Mike the current owner husband. This restaurant attract of a lot tourist visit by Taxi. When I am there, I see at least three taxis unload their customer to the restaurant. This is the place to visit if you visit New Orleans.",

This area they need improvement. \n\nI like to give the high mark on the delivery system they have. They will give you the progress of the delivery, such as agent delivery assigned, appliance on the trucks route, and final call they will be here in half hour.

They main reason they survive for so long is due to their regular customers. There is a reason why people keep coming back. The reason are quantity of food and affordable to many. \n\nWe have chop BBQ pork sandwich. I this this is their best seller because the chop pork and house sauce make this dish savory. We also has two meat combo. This dish I consider is a value dish. We got baby back rib and chicken. It come with 4 bone rib and quarter chicken in good price. I like they provide the BBQ sauce in warm condition which not sit on the table and condensed. This may be their selling point for the regular who coming back.",

The only complaint is they cook these lamb chop to almost well done which I ask for medium. I also asking for sauce to be on the side which they didn't do.  \n\nOverall service is attentive.

The crab was fresh. Sometimes they don't have crab due the crab is too small and not worth to sell to customers. Now is the season. Some of the crab have egg. I like to eat them when watching a game at TV and enjoy my finger food slowly. My wife have garlic no 1 order with snow crab. Other than snow crab, it has the shrimp, sausage, potatoes and corn.

Since we don't have 1/2 star, four stars was given. \n\nWe select the Christmas for our visit at the hour of their opening of the door. This will take out the crowed conditions for serving and the busy kitchen situation. This will give them a fare review. \n\nWe have order the two appetizer- the Roti and the Pla Muek Yang. The roti is two round roti cut in eight pieces. It has the Malaysian roti taste. Although this may be from packaged factory made but was pan fried perfectly. I like the curry dipping. \n\nPla Muek Yang aka grilled squid. It marinated in curry or Cumming. It is flame grilled and you can see the grilled mark. The only complaint it the dish come out cold. Seem like sit a bit before it was brought out. It serves with sweet sauce. It is about three squid cut in ring. \n\nOur entrees order is disaster. It take three rejections before we got our order. There are three items they don't carry yet. But I did not count against them on this review. I have order the Phat Chinese Broccoli and pork belly and they have given me Asian BBQ pork and Pork Belly  noodle. I did not ask them to change since it look interesting. We also added the spicy chicken seafood noodle. \n\nThe Asian noodle soup base is very interesting and different. I believe the ingredients was not the same as described in the menu. The spicy chicken noodle are very close to Thai street noddle but in the sweet side. This two dishes is just ok. \n\nFood is about 3.5 rating; service is about 4.0 and the kitchen crew is about 3 ratings. I believe the kitchen should not have any excuse because there only three customers when we were there. They should not busy and should handle the food better.",

Food is good enough but the price seem like in the high side. Decoration is bit run down. But it is the beginning of the restaurant.

The topping with the fried candies pork belly is delicious. The philly flatbread need work. The meat of shaved ribeye is too little. It need to be more for that price. We added the Fabio's meatballs. This one comes with grits. The last dish we have is the Italian Steak. This is the New York strip cut. The steak is cook to asking temperature. If this dish come with broccolini will be better.

It is actually pleasant and quite moments to around that time. The decoration is simple. They do have some wall unit sofa. The also have the stool high top section. Other than that, the outside sitting also available. \n\nThey serve salty, sweet, or breakfast crepe. Some of the lunch salty crepe is interesting. Please look at their special of the day which not in the menu. It may surprise you. Happy hour start 7 pm to close. Beer and wine half off. \n\nI got the nutty joe.

It is sweet with chewy condition.",

It is great if you on the business trip by yourself and seat on the piano bar. \n\nI have the southern style shrimp and grit. The shrimp count is at the large size. The ingredient include chorizo ham and bacon. It make the taste interesting. I would said this is average value. I like the piano music at the bar. It make the time pass quicker while you eat and listen. \n\nThe signature margarita is average. The service of the bar is a bit slower due high volume customer during that time i.

We also have the appetizers of chicken wings and crab cake, the wing was good but the crab cake is not recommended. Is has a lot of dough in it. It is also like devil crab not is not devil crab. \n\nService once is engaged, it is fast. You may want to ask who is your server.

They are very careful on not letting the cut hair get in your dress. I always like their scissor cut. Trimmer on the edge. This show their skill.

So you have to arrive and find out your fate. On the weekend is over hour to get in. However, they get your cell phone number and text you when the table is ready. Once they text you, you have 5 minutes to respond that you still want your table, then 5 minutes to show up. Which give you time to walk around the mall. If you need 10 minutes time to walk back. Don't respond immediately, response close to your 5 minutes is up. \n\nThe decorations is definitely eye catching. I like many of the ambient. It is beautiful. It is fiesta atmosphere. Seem like you seat on open air restaurant with stars hanging over you. Music is good volume and still able to make conversation at bar area. \n\nThe food is the main thing that they need to make the most improvement. Go from the bad to good. The taco are the area need to make the most improvement. We have order 4 tacos. The shrimp, blacken fish, cochinita (roast pork) and carne Asada (wood grilled steak). The pork is lack of flavor. The fish is dry and over cook, the shrimp is just broil and serve. The best is the steak that is a star. I would suggest control how the fish is cook. The pork may be need to marinate and cook in the thicker sauce and the shrimp grilled it before put it in the taco. \n\nThe entr\u00e9e is the ceviche and the grilled chicken with mole chocolate sauce. I like both of the dish. It is not a wow but above average. I do like their table side guacamole. They have options for the spiciness and chunky of the avocado. I like the chip because they have spice on top and tasty then the most restaurant. \n\nOverall is good experience. We have very good service. Our waiter is experience. I have read some of the reviews of my friend that some of the waiter are not up to the task. But our night was good may be it is weekend and they have the experience waiter.",

The pork belly is fried to give more flavor to release to the soup. Usually fried pork belly soak the pork oil. When it mix up with liquid, it release the belly oil into the soup. Clever ideal.

I understand there are many spice cannot be obtained in America or in the conditions it was provided such as wet curry paste. However, it does not give the excuse to cut short the way it was prepared in Malaysia. \n\nThis restaurant name Kampong meaning the village in Malay. They do hope this is Malaysian village cuisine. Actually they are many way to cook the dish. Especially the Nyonya Cuisine - a mixed of Chinese and Malay cuisine by the the descendent of the mixed marriage. Laksa and Prawn Mee are the two good examples. Laksa and Penang laksa are very different. Penang laksa is not curry base. It suppose to be fish meat was ground in tiny piece with the laksa ingredients such as lemon grass. You may disagree with this restaurant serve with curry base. \n\nThe prawn mee are very close to my mom cooking. The soup base is make from shrimp head and shell. I like the sambal to be added to increase the taste. This is yet their best Malaysian dish. The Malaysian satay is still off since they are not grilled on the open flame. The wing marinate can be more strong curry taste. The last dish I try is the Nasi Lemak. This is typical Malaysian food with coconut rice. I don't like the beef to be sliced and cook in special sweet chili sambal sauce. The beef need to be in rendang gulai in cube. The dried little fish (Ikan billi) need to in this chili sauce. \n\nI would said authentic enough in Tampa Bay Area. But not the best in US. Their first two page are the Malaysian cuisine mostly. Service is good. May be need to try more. 4 stars is a bit stretch at this point.",

It was good enough spice to turn the snapper fillet spicy. I also like the accompanying mushrooms truffles oil french fry. It is delicious with the parsley. The Ahi tuna poke bowl has good enough sesame oil to enhance the taste. Instead of rice as starch, we has ask for the noodle. \n\nWe also order the coconut grouper finger first time. It turn out a good choice. Love the atmosphere and food. Service is good. If you come at off hours, they have more discount.",

I would said this restaurant are tone done the heavy taste of Vietnamese cuisine to make it more receptive for general population. The cuisine is still good and close to Vietnamese heritage.\n\nWe got the fried quail for appetizer. This dish is crispy and good marinated. The only thing about this dish is the  price do not fare well with other restaurants. They are in the high side. \n\nThe main entry we have the special combination Pho noodle and the vermicelli with grilled pork and shrimp. Both of the dish is delicious. As I mentioned they tone down the fish sauce to make it easier for they Americans born residents. I think this is a good move. Overall service is good.",

The new space is nice and plenty of parking space. Their menu has combination special with their signature roll and two other typical roll. Their sushi category divided into cook, raw, or tempura. \n\nI have order two of their signature roll. The Nambomb and the Sunburn. The Nambomb is real snow crab in fill. Not the imitation krab meat. The snow crab meat was mix and mash with creamy sauce. The it roll and top with tuna and salmon. I like the in fill snow crab meat. The Sunburn is roast beef top on the roll. The in fill is lobster meat. The only comment I made is they need to do something about the beef. Instead of roast beef, may be they can create their own beef is more attractive such as grilled beef. \n\nOverall experience is good. The restaurant still young.

I got the cucumber, cherry tomato, mango, pineapple and last with shiitake mushroom which not use by most poke place. They have the protein and mixed in combo with sauce and stir the mix before put in to the base. Good technique. \n\nThe topping selection has 4. I got crab meat, seaweed salad, octopus and masago. Considering this good topping. Food is a bit expensive but has good topping and base. I would make some changes with sesame seed, bonito flake and onion crip to free add on instead count as topping.

It is a rocket fuse. \n\nThe Smoke Chicken Purtine go with fried and dripping cheese. It sprinkled with bacon. It is a good finger food. I would eat this dish first before the rocket man. Because rocket man has stronger taste will overpower the smoke chicken purtine. \n\nThe few things that keep them from my 5 stars is the side we got is braised collards is $4. A bit at expensive. Most dish come with side dish but here is added on.",

But you need to adjust for calling ahead or visit in the off hour (not meal time). They take their time to grill the meat and the wait time is long.\n\nWe got the combo meal with sirloin skewer come with two sides - white rice and the grilled veggies skewer. It also come with yucca flour with secret ingredients. Very nice. Got to get the yucca flour. We also got the grilled chicken and the grilled pork chop. My favorite amount three is the chicken because they grilled with technique preserves the juicy meat and marinated into the meat. I would any of this items are top restaurant quality. Love it. \n\nThe price is very affordable no wonder many people willingly to wait for their food to be grilled. If you want to have catering, they have the option to do so. Just hire them. This is better than any Brazilian grill meat restaurant.",

    "text": "Hibachi night. My wife have been to this restaurant many time and this is my first. I am usually not order the steak. I am usually order the seafood. The steak cook on the hot  steel plate is usually not as good open flame grilled.\n\nTonight we have started with onion mushroom soup and ginger salad- come with the meal. The fried onion soup is great but the ginger salad is so so. I think their ginger dressing is too little. To taste a good sushi chef you always order the spicy tuna as a test drive. The sushi came with whole piece cube tuna and slice cucumber. They have a bit of wasabi to make it a bit spicy. A true spicy tuna should be hand chop and dice into tiny pieces then add the sesame oil, raw quail egg, and spicy chili sauce. Then, they are mixed together and wrap in the seaweed wrap. This is true spicy tuna. I believe they have fail at this department. \n\nOur entree is the calamari and tuna with shrimp. We have specified how they are cook. The tuna is seared the outside and the calamari needs to burn a little bit on the out side. The chef did a very good job on this dish not only preserve the good quality of the material and also well season for the hot steel plate cooking. \n\nI would not recommend any sushi but highly recommend the hibachi. Be brave to order the calamari and try it. You will not disappointed. The service is good. As a result they deserve 4 star. If you come with your birthday ID and with a paid friend. The birthday entree is free. For the lady, do not need to wear expensive dress due to the food smoke may stick to your dress, hair and hand bag. You only dress for food. Be prepare wash your hair after visit due to food smoke may stick to your body. That is the price of hibachi.",

On the weekday lunch we went, the food come out quick enough. \n\nThe restaurant is very close to center Ybor. We seat by ourselves since the waiter was in the kitchen and not in scene.

The shrimp is broil and grilled. \n\nThe dish do not give me wow factor but they are good Italian dish. The Alfredo sauce is great and creamy, I don't like it too watery and this restaurant did it correctly. With added shrimps, my dish is total $16. Average deal.

It top with ricotta salata cheese and Calabrian hot sauce on the side. I like the octopus and I love the fried cauliflower. My wife entree is Naduja Meatballs pasta. It serve with tomato sauce and spaghetti. I think this dish is not impressive for the price that they label. It can be different on sauce or something. My entree is good.

There one appetizer I will try next time. Escolar Tataki. I will try it on my next visit. \n\nThis time we started at crabby steak roll. This roll is the most expensive in the menu. Better be good. The result did not disappoint us. It is seared steak on top of the roll with truffle salad. The inside is actual snow crab meat. Yummy. \n\nWe have the ramen bowl. It has crispy pork belly, porch egg, shiitake mushroom. The only I like to said is they do give a lot of ramen noodles compared the ramen I have eat. I would said keep it up. It is a selling point. \n\nWe have the tonkatsu chicken. It is fried chicken with sweet sauce. It come with sunny side up egg, sunomono cucumber, kimchi.

    "text": "This is very interesting restaurant I have try today. The outside of the restaurant look like a fast food building. The glass is all tinted that you are not able to look inside. You may think the restaurant is run down and close down. The lighted open sign behind the heavy tinted windows is very hard to spot. With one door lock, you will think that the business is close down by the outward looking and lack of car parking outside. Since you cannot see inside due to tint window you may thought the restaurant is close. If they lock the door please call them to check and have them open the door. I usually don't write that much about the outward look of the restaurant. This is just to let you know don't walk away from good food inside. \n\nThe amazing dish of this restaurant is the Biryani plate. It is combination Indian food with a lot of items. From curry, rice, sweet to Nan. You will get a full variety of food in beautiful spice cooking. I have this dish in one of the Indian restaurant in Miami before. This is a better option from any Indian restaurant with all-you-eat. This restaurant actually prepared the food well with correct balance of spice. \n\nToday we have open our lunch with an appetizer-dried pepper chicken. This dish is prepared with different dried pepper. The chicken is deep fry and cook with saffron spice. The dry pepper is added per customer liking for the spiciness. I like it to be spicy because the spicy is not just for the hot and spicy but for the enhancement as a seasoning. This is a very great dish and I am recommended this dish and spicy up the dish and drink a lot of water. One way to neutralize the spiciness is to eat it with rice. You can add the rice for $2 extra. \n\nOur entree is the mix platters. It has three different grilled chicken made in tandoori. Thus dish required time to wait since this is the dish needs time to make it there. You will require additional 20 minutes wait. The combination chickens are traditional tandoori chicken, Hariyari kebab, and Malai kebab. The tandoori is the slow cook yogurts and Indian spice. The Hariyari is grilled with marinated mint, garlic, and green chillies. The Malai is grilled with marinated cardamom, cream and mild Indian spice. The cardamom is India green seed spice. Now, are you hungry???? Come to try it yourself. \n\nThe kebab dish is just the kebab with no carb accompanying like Nan or Rice. If they can balance the meal to include rice or nan and vege, this will be a better attractive dish. As a result, we have to add the carb on the side.\n\nA recommendation for the restaurant is to remove the tinted window and allow customers to see inside the restaurant. Paint the outside to make it attractive. Provide carb or vege balance meal on kebab dish.",

The selection starts at Philly cheese steak to hot pressed sandwich. They also have the Black Angus burgers for your selection. Lunch time is a line. I am not sure they take order over phone. The dinner and lunch have the same menu. We were here for the dinner. We have order the Cajun Chicken Cordon Bleu and the Uncle Muzzies   Mufaletta. The chicken is well season with Cajun spice and top with Capicola ham. The sandwich is yummy and the chicken is half breast. They are juicy since they seal the juice of the breast inside. The Muzzies Mufaletta is the similar name to the general store in the New Orleans that sells the Mufaletta. The different of the mufaletta here is there are hot pressed. The sandwich includes smoke ham, genoa salami and provolone cheese with green olive in Cuban bread. What a strange combination. The sandwich is not bad but they are not as good as the New Orleans.\n\nOverall the restaurant is good. I did not try their burger since they are rated number 1 in New Tampa.

I would said try their food there is the best. May be go at sun down time where the air is not too hot. They have out side sitting. The inside sitting is very close to kitchen with food smell if you like that.",

Food has good quantities, 3. Good taste. \n\nGreenland have a lot o picture shot display at Middle East. All this famous land mark make you experience want to travel to Middle East. We have order the mix grill - shish kabab and the chicken shawrma - and kufta kabab. The shish kabab is grill lamb chunk with spice. I like the way they grill it with no lamb meat smell. The meat is tender and folk tender to bite. This is good. The chicken also came out perfectly. The other dish is the kufta kabab is make of the ground beef and the lamb. My kid always have a joke of \"what is cow without leg - ground beef\". Now, the mixture of the two type of meat and spice it up at the grill make the dish very desirable. \n\nThe meal came with hummus, non bread and mix green. The price of the dish and the quantities of the food make the selection to the top.",

We arrived at 7 pm and the prime rib already sold out. We cannot beat retiree around that area that comes early. Just kidding. \n\nWe start our night with the steamer. Nick is the experts in this area. He shows us how to eat it. The steamer is steam to cook first. The outer black skin need to undress from the clam body. Then it is clean in the broth or beer. Then dip into to butter and enjoy by eating it. Some has added pepper and lemon after clean it. This is a very adventurous item in the menu. \n\nI have the fried sea scallop and fried whole snapper. The snapper come with the batter coating outside. When come to whole fried fish, you want to make sure the meat inside is cook. This restaurant did it correctly. The only thing is the coating is tasteless. I prefer it to be season. However the fish is fresh and good. For fresh seafood, you do not require too much seasoning. \n\nThe fried scallop is very tasty because the coating was seasoning with flavor. When you break the scallop, the meat of the scallop is like a string which means the freshness of the food. \n\nOverall the seafood is fresh, the portion is very generous, and the service is great.",

We pass by the restaurant that Rachel has suggested earlier and we decided to try. \n\nThis is a Puerto Rican restaurant has some traditional and fusion of its country cuisine. I was not hungry so I have the coconut creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e and skirt steak turnover. I saw Fern has the special chicken roulade - chicken breast wrap in bacon, chorizo, sweet plantain and cream cheese look very yummy. \n\nI was surprise that the turnover skirt steak is chop not ground. It makes the turnover fantastic good. The creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e is not the normal one. It is more to flan base with minor caramelize sugar over it and top with coconut flake. This is one of the unique creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e I have taste. You can skip all dinner but don't skip the dessert. \n\nWe have fun in this restaurant and Fern bust some move of the salsa at the stage. The stage use for performance at special event they host, live music was play here. It was fun as the slogan said \"I won't be impressed with technology until I can download food\". Dream on. May be one day will happen.",

We also got grouper tostada. It interesting to have it. Not much memorable like the wing. \n\nOverall we like the concept with beer. A great hang out place.

This may be their success of the restaurant. They do have ice cream, waffles, milkshakes, energy drinks and more. It is a Restaurant not required vegetable oil. Healthy choices also in sweet side. Guilty pleasure. \n\nWe got the classic waffle. It has different chop and slide fruits. You can tell they process their fruit to sweetness (may be dipping syrup or sugar). So you will not find sour fruit. I like this way very well. That why you paid the money for assembly fruit and waffle. The topping and ingredients is harmony melt together. \n\nEach plate they serve has some writing. We have our name on it.",

Recommended. \n\nWe also 24 oz special boba tea. This boba tea has earl grey tea with peach, strawberry, raspberry flavor. The popping boba is the pomegranate popping boba. It was delicious. Fist time has pomegranate boba. \n\nOverall is good. The wait for the food is long. 30 minutes. Same as all walking customers to wait. If they can improve on kitchen speed, it will help.",

My son teacher when he has the math competition at East Bay High School, Our neighbor and Rachel M. This must be good restaurant to visit.\n \nThe restaurant has the harbor view that out look to the gulf. We were having the choice of the inside or outside seating. This time of the year with 74 degree outside temperature, the outside sitting is comfortable. Our waiter is quick on the feet to show us the favorite dish in the menu. We have order the Cajun Salmon and the Tuna Tokyo that was recommended by the waiter. The food came in about 15 minutes. My dish is the Cajun Salmon that come with rice and zucchini. The zucchini is stir fry and lightly grilled over the open flame. This is the technique of the chef uses stir fry with the right seasoning and grilled it to add the flavor of the open flame. The Cajun spice on the salmon is almost like the blacken preparation.  The fish is prepared superbly to dine. The Tuna Tokyo is delicious too. The Sashimi grade tuna is grilled outwardly and slice in the \u00bc\" piece and spread over the rice and steam green bean. Most of the restaurant sear the tuna with peppercorn but this restaurant use the grilled technique for the tuna. The inside is still like sashimi and great to eat. This is a know how to handle the material and maintain the high grade for the taste. The tuna is drizzle with sweet wasabi sweet soy sauce. The balance of the drizzle sauce to be contacted with the freshly grilled outward meat make sense. Well done by the chef.\n\nThe lunch price is very reasonable for fine dining.  We were happy to be here to enjoy the great weather and accompany with great food. This is definite a place to go. We will be back for more. The service is good and quick. The host also seat us quick.",

In the same time, their overhead is higher too. \n\nI got the tripe soup, carnitas, pastor, lengua, and barbacoa tacos. The taco come with meat and tortilla. One positive thing is they bring the onion and cilantro for you to add your own. They also supply the lime to squeeze in. The green and red sauce is provided. I like their tripe soup because they are cook to soft. \n\nThe meat choices is marinated and good for you to buy home and cook yourself. This is something new.

This way you can protect yourself. \n\nThe facility near the entrance pet beach path has a dog wash station to rinse off the salt water for your pet. There is no human shower near here.

The also has some fusion of the two cuisine dish. I only have the experience on the Thai side. I will update when I try their fusion dish. \n\nThis restaurant can heat it up the chili spiciness since they have the use of Mexican chili. If you like spicy food, look no further. It is sweaty hot. It also can go up a level to numb your lip. \n\nI have the basil spicy calamari. I have order the Thai hot. It did not disappoint me. This dish is wet sauce compare to some with dry sauce. It has good flavor. My friend ordered the fried rice. I think it need a bit hot oil burn and stir fried. \n\nOverall we like our time there. I like their watermelon boba. Close out is good and service is good.",

It good for this time of year. We sit out side and we were able to see what people eating inside the dinning hall. Some of the table so close that only separate by grass window. \n\nThis restaurant is Asian fusion with Thai and sushi. I have order the spicy tuna and Bahamas roll. The spicy tuna can be improved to make it dice cube to be more firm on the fish meat. The Bahamas roll is great. It is baked chop scallop with sherrard imitation crab meat over California roll. It is tasty for this roll. The sushi is added the eel sauce and make it more pleasant. \n\nThe service average. There people smoking for little time than it was distinguished. We are glad that he did it.",

When the customers walk in, the light already do the trick. Many has left their chalk memory at the wall that is cool color under the black light. \n\nWe have ordered the one topping and the liquid nitrogen freeze sweets roll. They have three topping for about 8 dollars. But the one topping is about $5. I like the liquid nitrogen freeze items. This is not child play item. Because the liquid nitrogen can be hazardous if you did not handle carefully. They have written instructions how to dip and eat eat the frozen food. They also have to rule about handling and disposing the liquid nitrogen. \n\nOverall I think this is a hip place to try. Like the black light. It make you cool.",

But I applause their attitude to create new dishes on their special of the night. \n\nI was surprised the restaurant has good interior and seat. We were their fist customers when they just began to open on Monday. They usually close on Monday. We have order the chicken biryanis and the Mutton Masala with rice and naan. The biryanis to me need more heavy spice. Chicken may need more seasoning. On the other hand, the Mutton or goat meat is excellent. Masala is a mixed of many spice and create the base. It may varied from different restaurant due to the mystery of the spice use. But I can said I love this dish. The naan is blend. Not sure they make it by themselves. \n\nIn order to attract more people, I think they need to change the way of business. They need to change the plastic ware for the plate and utensils to better presentable serving ware. Disposable ware shouldn't be used for the dine in condition.",

The Patacon is traditional dish of Columbia, the Patacon here is top with grilled chicken, Pork rinds. I say it is just ok. The reason I am here is to try their The De Carne Desmechada. They use two fried tostones with one on top and the other at bottom for a sandwich. The infill is Ropa veja which cook very well to accommodate the Latin style sandwich. Very tasty.

I have ordered the Baja Fish, Pork Belly, Spicy Chorizo, Fried Oyster, Curry Shrimp, Sesame Ribeye, and Duck Taco. I like the oyster, duck and pork belly tacos. \n\nThe service is great in the beginning but it takes too much time to close up for the check. I like them for quick snack in the future.

As a result I have try them out. \n\nTheir price is at affordable range. Majority of the items are under $10. But I go for the most expensive in the menu. The mix grilled. It has chicken, steak and kefta (ground lamb). The dish come with basmati rice and two sides. We go for grilled veggies and the babaghanoush. You can feel chunks egg plant in the babaghanoush. We also add the falafel. The dish comes with good presentation. The steak is the best among all three types of meat. All meat was grilled very well not burn. \n\nIt is almost like cafeteria style order at the counter and food bring to the table. Service is good.",

Both plates are excellent. The Marsala chicken can taste the wine sauce in the dish. Our final dessert is the chocolate decadence and key lime pie. Both are well decorated. \n\nService is good. Food come out very quick. We enjoy our time here.",

The grand opening is 8/25. 1 to 5 pm they have the sample treat. \n\nI am here earlier before the grand opening. I have try their fried calamari and the matcha red bean slush. The fried calamari is very close to Taiwanese style batter coating. The coating is crispy. The calamari is great to dip into the sweet sauce. \n\nI like their matcha red bean slush because the red bean is savory. Matcha ice is well blend. It is great with the red bean. The food order came out quick enough for the take out. \n\nThe restaurant divided into two sections. One side for sit down restaurant and the other side for the take out express.

It is great watermelon juice cocktails with tequila. Chili salt rim make it nice to lick off. \n\nWe have the Go-Chu-Jiang rib as a shareable. It come with three ribs. It is Korean BBQ sauce. For me this dish is just average. I would go for other items. \n\nWe got the Texas two step. 2 meat and 2 side. We got the beef brisket and the pork brisket. The beef brisket is definitely done very well. The pork brisket is just so so. The two side are purple slaw and the tri color purple potatoes salad. Both are good. \n\nService is really good at bar.

The natural flavor is good enough with add a bit of salt. By the way, the Taco topping is assemble by your own. This is a plus for the customer to choose which topping he like the most. The way I like my taco is only add cilantro. May be a bit of salsa. That is all which able to preserve the natural flavor of the meat. \n\nThe service in this restaurant is attentive.

Basically I said if you original concrete floor conditions has perfect elevation or you just need to change the carpet to plank, they are your people. \n\nWhat they offer. \nSome plank has life time warranty and some has limited warranty. They will offer to move large pieces furniture, installation, edging molding, and transition pieces. \n\nWhat not offer. \nAdjust due to existing condition, painting on molding. \n\nThe contractor followed the guideline of COVID if they are too close to you. They help moving the large furniture which is convenient to the home owner. They do have good selection. However the call back for punch list item to finish off take too long and wait. Overall their value of the plank is good quality. We install the Nuvelle 20 mils 5.5 mm thick luxury vinyl plank. Our color was the seaside pecan. I like the plank has minor texture and not cold when you step on during winter. \n\nI would suggest any home owner before visit do their homework on the plank. You really don't want a plank holding at end edge and deflect a lot. Minimum mil need to be 12 mil and minimum thickness should be at least 5 mm. Most home bedroom is 5 mil surface and kitchen is 12 mil. Most commercial restaurants use 20 mil to avoid surface broken. I use the commercials grade. Pay a little more but easy maintain. \n\nOverall we like work done at our house. It was easy clean on our floor now.",

The only thing I would said is the the aisle may be make it single direction aisle until the restriction is relax. \n\nToday I was luck to see they have the cotton candy grape. But that is not cheap. I don't mind the price as long as the grape has the cotton candy flavor. In fact they also sweet. I got the premium prosciutto. I have it thin slice. They help me as much as possible to thin the slice. I like it they separate each cut with paper. \n\nI also got the MacMurray Pinot Noir. This 2016 has great fruity taste and also smooth medium body. I did not see much of this wine other alcohol store. This is from Russian River Valley which I like plus the good year of grape. \n\nThe entrance has a lot of orchids. It is a welcome sign for me to pulse and admire.",

We got the meat lover and it has good meat such as sausage, pepperoni, bacon, ham and meatball. The sausage is slice peel cut sausage. It enhances the taste. Many topping here is not your typical pizza store use ingredients. \n\nWe got their specialty dish of the day. Baked Stuffed Shrimp with Crab Meat. The four big pieces of giant shrimp stuffed with a lot of crab meat. It come with garlic rice. This my first time have garlic rice. Very unique. It also come with mixed veggies.

However the spice and ingredients are there. With that said. Let me get into the experience. \n\nMitmita is actually meaning one of the Ethiopian Spice. It can be mixed and make many dish. I like the restaurant reflecting their true calling. The culture of food is use a piece of injera to pick up a bit of entree by hand and eat it. That is how it done to enjoy the different cuisine. \n\nWe have a group there can try different dishes. Injera is a crepe type sheet for pick up the food. The best dish is the Ye-doro Wat. This is a chicken dish with Ethiopian Ber-bere sauce. The sauce has so many ingredients. It is flavorful. We also order the  Kat Wat the chop beef with Ethiopian bbq sauce, Kitfo the lean beef is with the Mitmita sauce, Gored Gored the raw tenderloin beef with amaze sauce. Those are good dishes. \n\nAfterward we have Ethiopian coffee with ceremony incense to celebrate special occasions. It was a great celebration. On the appetizers, we have the chicken, veggies, and beef sambusa. Very tasty. We have good time there.",

    "text": "I notice this restaurant when one of the yelper comments she went to her family dinner. I saw some of the some of the picture she post is delicious. I have book mark it for next visit. \n\nIt is sad to see the plaza is empty. However the restaurant is the likely attraction in the plaza has most of the cars in front of the store. We have order two dishes of the menu. The waitress is friendly to take our order. \n\nWe have the fried pig intestine and the mixed mushroom with round eye beef. The intestine is deep fried then slice into pieces and come with sweet chili sauce. The outside is crispy and the inside is soft. This is a plain fried intestine. I prefer the marinated then fry because is more flavor. Mixed mushroom include straw mushroom and the Russian mushroom with slice round beef in strip. The beef did have a process to tenderize the meat to soften. This dish is cook with sweet soy base sauce. \n\nIn this area, it uses to have good Chinese restaurant. Lately many of the restaurants either is go backward to serve American style Chinese food or the main chef left. As a result it is consider this restaurant is decent among the Chinese restaurants.",

Buy your ramen at the machine and they will bring it out for you.\n\nI like the decorations with the Japanese cartoon. One of the cartoons is if you bring your grandmother to the ramen place, there is a chance she will make the ramen cross stitch. Imagine that ramen sweater :). \n\nWe have order the tonkutsu ramen. It come with two pieces of pork belly, two half of porch egg, bamboo shoots and mushrooms. I like the pork belly pan fried to crispy before adding to the ramen. Soup is good. I think if they use a bit pork bone to make the soup thicker is nicer. \n\nOverall our experience is pleasant. Love to come back to visit to try other item in the menu.",

Most if the people is off today from work, as a result, it is easy to get reservation. Usually this place is pack with people at lunch time. \n\nToday we have 11 people in a group. The waiter took our order in less 2.5 minute. I have order the garlic pepper squid with Thai hot. The lunch here is a combo with the soup and appetizer.  The soup is chicken rice clear soup. The chicken was marinate and process before it put on the soup. I always like chef to make an extra step of food process. As a result, the chicken is a bit salty when you separate from the soup but not overpower the soup taste. I usually don't like plain chicken that was not process. The chef here did a good job. The appetizer is the crab Rangoon (fried wanton skin wrap the ground pork). It came with see Thai chili dipping sauce. \n\nThe main course is the squid in Galicia pepper. I like they prepare the pepper burn in high heated oil with garlic. This make the flavor enhance and great to eat. The restaurant majority of the food including some sweetness to the taste except this dish and a few dish are salt base. \n\nOverall the service is good and the food is good. If you have group, please call ahead before lunch. This place easy fill up.",

When the yelp people get together is always a mission to laugh and enjoy the food. Our birthday girl has a speech but we were unsuccessful to create for her a tear drop moment. Love to yelp and play together. \n\nThe restaurant is very accommodating for our event. We have over 30 peoples and we enjoy every moment of it. When we have order, we share the plate with the group. I have order the Hot and Crunchy Tuna Bowl and the Dynamite Crab Roll. The Tuna is seared and chop into pieces. The crunchy part is actually from the tempura batter onion. This dish actually can be improve if they have season the tuna with spice and seared and slice instead of chop cube. I like the bowl with brown rice. The Dynamite Crab Roll is included the Alaskan crab meat. I think the mango overtake the taste of the crab meat. I have a chance to try our friend share plate with Dino & Jimmy roll. This is Alaskan crab meat with tempura shrimp. I like this roll better than the Dynamite Crab roll. I also like my friend Kale salad. It is well season and correct dressing. \n\nDuring the Sunday, all day happy hour price. Now, this a deal! I have the sangria with red wine. This is a giant glass. One glass is enough. Basically you have to drink some of the sangria before you pull the wine bottle out. Or it will be overspill. Love the drink here.",

The strip is perfectly grill with original meat taste. The asparagus is not too fiber and the stem is soft to eat. I also add a cup of clam chowder with crab meat. This is one of my favorite chowder. The crab meat can feel the lump pieces. \n\nI usually call ahead 30 minutes if I have the Togo order. When I arrive, the food just completed in right timing.",

    "text": "Yes. I like this wine bar restaurant. I have seen many of our fellow yelpers reviewed this restaurant and I have book mark them for some time. Finally, I have the chance is open up since the other restaurant close at 8 pm.\n\nThe restaurant does have a wine bar. I like their wine by the glass selection. You can buy the wine by ounce. They start with 3 ounces glass and you can add by the multiple of 3 ounces. The price will be added on until you can get a whole bottle. For me is perfect since my wife do not like alcohol and I can go with the food with how many ounce I need. The wine list seems like changing base on the availability. \n\nTonight we started with fried pita bread with the red bean paste and the calamari as appetizers. The pita is crispy and loves to use it to pick the paste. The calamari is normal but the sweet chili sauce makes it to the top. I like it with the caper and make this unique from other fried calamari.\n\nWe have the beef empanada and the lobster bisque. The beef empanada is so so. The Bisque is good but the lobster crump is too less.\n\nOur entr\u00e9e are the Lobster Risotto and the Grilled Salmon with green bean. The salmon is greatly grilled and top with tomato salsa. This is OK dish. The lobster risotto has six large shrimp in it. Again the lobster meat crump is too less. \n\nOverall the meal for two with a glass of wine with tip is approximate $50 is not a bad deal. I may come back to visit some time when I finish my book mark. The tablet to call the service is useless. We have press it twice and nothing happening. Use the hand signal is the best.",

The final course is the Apfelstrudel - the slice apple and slice dough tower on cold vanilla sauce. Make my tummy happy. \n\nOverall the food is good and services is good.

    "text": "This Krewe is name after the big Lake Pontchartrain. This is one of the daytime parades and has more action and good for the kid who cannot stay late at night. This is one of the parades I like since it just located two building from my resort. When we hear the music we know the parade is arrived.  Parents please check the progress of the parade if you decided to watch at the Canal Street. It usually takes about 2 hours to reach here since the parade is 4.5 miles before it reach the Canal Street. \n\nThe parade consist of dance school, Cajun Indian and Cowboy horse Riding Club, Tulane ROTC, High and Middle school marching band, flag team, cheer leader, private school team, Big Easy Roller Girls, Muff-A-Lottas, Academy school. Of course there is King and Queen Float and other Float for the beads. The parade comes with dune buggy, horses, tractor pull float, and pony. There people dress like black Cowboy and white Indian. I like the Muff-A-Lottas group of waitress dance with their serving tray. \n\nThis is the parade you can see far away when they approach. A tip is to find a spot where they turn and you can them far away. This is a parade I recommended for the children to enjoy since it is daytime not late at night. There big amount of bead were giving out make people rush for it. Although there is barricade along the route, I still see adult doing unthinkable thing let their kid over the barricade and pick up the beads that left at the middle of street that hard to get.  This dangerous and the float may injure the kid.",

But they have good lunch and dinner menu. The lunch is less than $8.95 and their dinner menu is less than $15. I will certainly try them on if I near them next time. Their lunch menu includes shrimp po-boy and their dinner includes gumbo or jambalaya. \n\nPlease remember they are not open on Monday and Tuesday. Their restaurant is Creole Louisiana Style cuisine.

The setting of the restaurant is very nice that you can have variety of wine by glass. \n\nTonight we begin with a pound of mussel. It serves with spicy coconut herb broth. The broth is a bit spicy compare to normal mussel in butter garlic wine sauce. I actually like their spicy herb sauce over the butter garlic wine sauce. The mussel is great. The appetizer also comes with two garlic cheese bread. It is yummy to dip into the sauce and eat it with the soak bread. Now you are feeling hungry to try it tomorrow. \n\nThe entrees are the 12 oz NY strip and duck breast. Both dish meat come out with warm temperatures. They can improve this issue for the accompany side dish. Seem like they are waiting for the side dish to finish and they have not put the meat in the heat lamp to keep it hot. The NY strip comes correctly with the way I have order it. I think they need to heat up the grill with higher BTU grill will make this dish better with slightly burn. The duck is a bit fat under the skin. Overall the meat is well season. The side dish is actually better than the main dish. The stir fry mix veggie is flavorful. Overall the dishes are well prepared except they need to keep up the temperature of the meat. \n\nBase on the above experience, this restaurant is grade correctly with 3.5 stars. Since YELP doesn't have the half star, I am given them 4 stars. Service is great. Interior is great.",

By the way, you will not expect a lot table service. \n\nSince the meal come out in 9 minutes, the whole dinner only need less than half hour. This is deigning for quick outlet and short time. You have to love the pasta dish in order to love this $9 meal. They also run the 7 minutes $7 lunch. It will be good with short time lunch break with restaurant entree. You will in and out the restaurant in 30 minutes. Thus it is the faster dinner ever.",

I like the live music at the sidewalk and sidewalk seating. \n\nWe were here for the taco week. We got the spicy pork taco and Modelo beer. The taco was good to enjoy. The pork has some spicy in it with a kick. I would said American Spiciness. Not the Mexican spicy. The modelo only 3 dollars on that day is a steal. \n\nWe enjoy the atmosphere there.

This restaurant close to the epic of Vietnamese cuisine in Pinellas Park. They need to show the know how to survive and attract to the customers. \n\nThe restaurant menu is not exciting. Very much similar to the surrounding. The grill pork may need to improve. Not just from the season sauce but also the grilled technique. \n\nI like the basil crispy chicken. That is the best dish. I like the five spice seasoning. We have the grilled pork vermicelli. The pork did not grille till the meat flavor come out. But the sauce in vermicelli is unique. The moonlight special is the steak and sunny side up egg. This dish is more American style. It is an attractive dish. The flavor is average. \n\nWe have the moonlight fruit drink and the lychee black tea. My wife like the black tea because is caffeine less with tea taste.",

The food spiciness is at medium range which my wife can take it. They have curry chicken, butter curry chicken, egg plant, biryanis, veggie spring roll, nan and more. One thing I like is their curry is good thick with a lot of spice. At the end, the have gulag ball for dessert. That is just to cool down the spiciness. \n\nOverall is good experience. Like the food. I like them spicier. I do want to suggest to add the goat curry if they know how to do it. Unfortunately we didn't see any traditional tandoori chicken. This items can be added.",

The drink order was delay on some of my friends. The cocktail select is good. No frozen drink. Craft cocktail is only a few. \n\nThe appetizers include Nueske Bacon, Fried Calamari Strip, Mac Roll, and Tuna Tartare. The mac roll is mac in 4 cheese in wonton skin and top with mango chili sauce. I like the tuna tartare the best. The house salad with feta vinaigrette and balsamic is good. \n\nThe food delivery is great. It is on time. I have the rib eyes and my wife have the sea bass.

The side includes 4 cheese mac, grilled asparagus and garlic smash potatoes. The selection asparagus may need to choose the thinner stem for softer section. Since the stem is large in diameter, the low end of stem is hard. A suggestion to chef is to remove hard stem section before serve.\n\nThe close out desert is average. The fried donut is ok. Overall the experience is good but no wow factor. It is solid restaurant for the American cuisine.",

I think it is about dinner time and only 3 group in font of us. \n\nOperation- the line to order has two counter. Although the time we visit only one counter is open. The wait is good. Which mean they can handle biggest line. It going to be interesting to Key in the choice for the customers. If customers has 16 choice with two in the group, it take about 2 minutes to three for each group because of the decision. I would suggest put a big sign board with the changeable picture of the donut so they make quick decisions instead of look at paper menu then go to counter and see the actual donut change the decision. This may smooth out the line a bit. The changeable board allow flexibility if the donut change the topping. The wait of making the donut is good. I like the owner at coffee counter too. \n\nThe food- I gave an \"A\" on the donut and coffee. I like they have personalize the donut. I like the maple bacon and pineapple upside down donut. Who can deny the BACON. The donut is finger licking good. Coffee selection is good enough for the selection. I would said keep the same quality throughout the business duration. That will be the challenge. \n\nI think it is good business model they have. They can change out the topping to keep the customers interested. I also like to challenge them not just the topping but change the dough type too. Keep up the good work make the donut on the spot and keep it fresh.

That way the poke is separate from the base and topping. \n\nFirst chose your size. Figure out how many scoop and base you want. Second chose your base. The base includes brown rice, white rice, kale slaw, or power blend. Third chose your poke protein. I will definitely go with double tuna or tuna plus salmon. Then chose you mix-in sauce. This part can get tricky because whatever you chose is on you. I usually chose multiple sauces in sweet side and poke sauce which is a bit salty. I also like it to go with green onion and cilantro. I wish they can add the corn, edamame, cucumber in the mix-in. It will be better. Why include as topping. \n\nThe great thing of this place is the have many toppings with fruit items which I like. Price wise is above average. But the have good sauce choice at the end. If use multiple sauce at the mix-in section, you may want warn them ahead so they don't put the first sauce too much become unbalanced. Good luck for the mix-in.

Quality control need to be made in order to get high mark. \n\nService is normal. Food come out in good speed. Seem like one waitress for serving and one for bringing out the food.",

Good deal. \n\nSome of the Sonny prepared the over cook or dry, but not at this place. I also like their slice pork. Especially the all you can eat slice pork deal. If you are hungry enough, it is a good choice for you. Plenty of food for money.\n\nThis is about 3.5 stars restaurant. Thy service is good and the food delivery is less than 7 minutes. Very fast.

The combo has included the grilled pork rice. These combo meal and drink is good for the customers. The meal include the grilled pork, pickle veggies, braised egg. It is affordable combo meal with drink at one price. \n\nService is good.",

    "text": "I like Thali Plate. And this restaurant has it. Thali mainly South Indian food. It is a meal with multiple dishes. The biggest thali can consist of 45 dishes which is call Kutumb. We don't have it in Tampa. At least the Thalia here have 9 dishes. Considering it is big enough. \n\nI order the non veggies thali. It has tandoori chicken, goat curry, chicken butter curry, chick pea curry, sweet rice pudding, mango lassi, rice, nan, and veggies. They have good take out box to contain this thali. I was surprised they have compartment to fill. I think the take home portion is smaller compared to eat it there. The mango lassi is good. I like the goat curry and the tandoori chicken. \n\nThe preparation will take minimum 30 minutes. So call ahead is a good ideal. The food is delicious but the portion for take out is small.",

We were on the first round of multi restaurants happy hour tour. Meat Market was our first stop and did not disappoint us. I like the out side seating, bar area and the dining hall. They do provide heat lamp if you sit close to outside. \n\nI start with a Quatro Verde. This cocktail has illegal mezcal, ancho reyes, and basil. It is a good cocktail with great alcohol in it. It worth the money. The chef start with complimentary spicy corn. It was great to go with the alcohol drink. The appetizers we got is roasted escargot. Each chamber has at least two escargot which is why they charge high price to make up the value. The next appetizer is the wood grilled Churrasco and fries. The steak is good quality with good fries. This is most expensive item in the appetizers. I would expect better. But still good. \n\nOverall the bar service started too slow. Need to pay attention to customer. After they engaged, everything is good.",

    "text": "Finally Pinellas has shot chicken place. This place is better than the one in Tampa. This hot chicken place are having their own building and drive through. I would said they are not quite organized yet. The menu definitely will make the first timer scratch their head. Because the order need three steps. First choose type of chicken, then the heat or spicy, then the side. This usually take time to make one order. As a result, it is slow to order if only one register open. This need to change. It need minimum two registers all time until their customers know immediately what they want. \n\nThe food is cook to order. So you need to be patient and wait. It is worthy to wait because it is good. I like the coating, flavor, and good pieces of chicken. We have chicken & waffle and quarter dark. The waffle was well made. The strip is well marinated. I like my quarter dark better because it has great coating. I got the hot level.  It is good heat.",

The restaurant is well decorated. I like the new space. \n\nWe were here for their lunch special. Two roll with soup or salad is $11. It is a good deal. The restaurant is kind of empty. It need good promotion for the local Carrollwood to attract more customers. We got the two roll with Atlantic and Tokyo Rolls. The Atlantic roll is very nice. It is a Striped Bass with imitation crab meat and lemon slice. The lemon slice enhances the flavor. I would recommend this roll. The Tokyo roll has tuna and yellow tail mixed. The spicy sauce make it very nice. \n\nOur next dish is the baked mussels. But I like this dish better at YBOR because they bake till crisp on the top. Nonetheless, it is good big pieces of mussels. We also got the tempura bento box. The tempura is not measured up because they just dip the wet batter and fried. They did not add the tempura while fried to make it hairy. \n\nOverall is a good visit. Good service.",

However, I was not able to visit after or before the games. I have to make a special trip for this restaurant. When arrive at this restaurant at 4:45, I was thinking we must be the first customer for the early arrival. I was surprised there were so many car in front already. Either I am really late or this is a popular place. Soon enough we founded out the early bird started from 2 to 5 pm daily. We beat the clock with 3 minutes to spare for the early bird. The early bird menu entrees are less than $9 except the steak dish for $14. What a steal. The people who dine there average age are at least 10 year older than me. I am just a young chicken when I was among them. \n\nWe have ordered the coco loco tilapia and stuffed tilapia. Then we look at their regular menu, we have order the Rockefeller oyster of six for $9. I also spot a before 6 pm margarita for $3. Our total include tax an tip is less than $35. Wow. This food may not excited you but it had a awesome value. Oysters is great when came out from the grilled. Love it. I like the shredder coconut on the tilapia. It come with two side. The stuff tilapia is not bad at all. Although it do not have the wow factor, it is fresh and good. \n\nThe margarita has full loaded alcohol. Usually if I got the discounted margarita, I fell dilute juice at the last melt drink. But the margarita here is strong. I will come to check them again since my wife also like it.",

It actually very thoughtful and they actually advertise their brand. Most of the family come to celebrate mother day at least 3 to 4 in a group. Some is more and actually bring business to the restaurant. \n\nI have order the steak quesadilla with cheese only. No veggies. My wife have the steak chimichanga. Did you notice their steak is good quality. Not tendon at all. Food was cool to right temperature with the cheese melt inside the quesadilla. If they have the steak grilled, I think they will attract more customers with correct marinated grilled steak. \n\nOverall. They are good food. Service is excellent. I did not try the grilled Mahi. May be next time.",

I have to warn you the restaurant is new and the service may take long since they don't have enough servers. Good luck to call in for to go since they are busy taking the order in the floor. \n\nSince they don't have enough server, I suggest you get the menu yourself is faster. I saw our neighbors waited 10 minutes to wait for the menu. Get your order in once they check on you.\n\nWe have order the ginger frog leg, grouper asparagus with wine sauce, duck raisin fried rice and the wet beef chow fun. I like their frog leg and their fried rice. \n\nSince they just open and the service is not quite there yet, only 4 star for good food.  Good pricing.",

What we call it slow day for business and they are trying to get rid of the inventory.\n\nI like the mall lay out in square shape. When you start at the same corner and end up in the same location in one loop. I hate mall go to one end and have to walk back to the starting point to get your car. West Shore Plaza more has many stores to offer. I like the restaurant there with P.F Chang, Season 52, Maggiano's Little Italy, Mitchell Fish Market, and the recent open Besito. \n\nThe mall has three parking garages that allow for parking in the shade. It is easy access to the mall from and to I-275. It has four anchor stores - Macy, Dick Sport, Sears and JC Penny. Please go to their web site to look for deal at the time. They also have the AMC Theater with 14 screens. Please check them out.",

It may require a PHD sturdy since they have ton of combination and topping selection. You think you have it all, not quite. As a statistical saying, I begin my quest with one Boba combination tonight. It is impossible and a tall task to try them all. \n\nI have been to many boba places; this place is the faster from order to deliver. May be they use the industry ice shave machine. No matter what, they are quick to deliver. The location is very tactical to be close to USF to attract students. The pricing is affordable compare to many Boba place. Tonight I have the Mango Snow with Boba. The boba cooks very soft. The mango snow is fruitier flavor. Many place you can feel the artificial fruit flavor but this place improve it to good tasting.  \n\nOverall, I like their menu. A lot of speciality to try, fast service. One good trick, go there at 9 pm and sit out outside. Wait for the summer Bush Garden firework and enjoy a cup of boba. Cannot bit that with free firework with boba.",

The au Poivre sauce is brandy cream sauce with mushroom. The brandy adds the enhancement and sweetens the sauce and brown the mushroom. It is very very good. The steak is the top Sirlion season with kosher salt and fresh ground pepper. It makes the exterior of the meat crispy. The steak company very well with the au Poivre sauce. The steak is well pick from the market and they are very tender. \n\nThe restaurant certainly has the food with good pricing. The only thing they really need to improve is the interior. The table, chair, lamp, and interior need to have makeover. They are too old and some table side is sticky. The food is 5 stars but the interior only allow me to award 4 stars.",

I like the yellow split pea pur\u00e9e. The steak was well medium rare. Very good. The steak dish all is good but the taste or sauce is not impressive. \n\nOverall is good. The food come out in the right time. Not much to wait.",

It is full of customers with one bar tender during weekday. I have waited at the bar area and not get my turn to serve and walk to the host to get a table to sit since sit down area has less people. It only happen at 6 pm that bar is more customers than the dining hall. \n\nI got the Churrasco for my main dish. This dish come with Mahon Cheese Grit at the bed and top with saut\u00e9ed veggies on top with the skirt steak in the middle. This is one way they presented. I would separate all three items instead of lay them over each other. This way I can taste different taste. This is a good dish to recommend. I also got the churro at the end with caramel and chocolate dipping sauce. The chef here has good skill for the Churrasco made the meat tender. \n\nThis is about 3.5 stars restaurant to my book. A few thing they can improve on. Since they have open air entrance, there is a lot food flight in the restaurant. It border me while I am eating. The bar area is too busy for just one person. May be need to look at how to improve the bar area when it is 80% capacity.",

The best part is to add the flavor into coffee. They have one flavor rarely seen. Lavender flavor. I would recommend that with fragrance smell. Other flavors include caramel, vanilla, hazelnut, mocha. \n\nThe tea includes chai latte, mango fruit tea, London fog, mocha ice tea and more. I would stop here again for coffee.",

It is for good taste, ingredients conscious healthy living, good price. Ciccio do have all the qualities above. \n\nWe order three items to share. The first is the daily special island poke. This dish has seared rare tuna, blacken pineapple, edamame, mango over the sticky rice. Nice combination with sweet ginger sauce. It is good dish. The only thing I don't like is chop up seared Tuna. I will prefer is slice and better presentation with slice. \n\nOur second dish is Thai Grilled Steak Bowl. It has lettuce, cilantro, mango, carrots, fried wonton skin. I like the grilled steak. I don't like the hard raw carrot. It doesn't go with the dish. \n\nOur third dish is Spicy Thai chicken. I like this dish because it has mushrooms and stir fried noodle. The stir fried is good. Although it is American style but is still quite good.",

I like the mango toppings better because it has better blend with the flakes. I feel the kiwi lost the flavor. If you order the big bowl, you can have two kinds of fruit toppings.

This is my first dinner to actually eat at David Island. \n\nWe have Pollo Al Forno w/ Lemons and Pollo Margherita. The Pollo Al Forno w/ Lemons is roast chicken with Italian herb. When the menu said with lemon, it actually with lemon Italian tomato base sauce. If I know it ahead I may change my mind because I don't like sour food. Nonetheless, the chicken is great. I think the potatoes can be smaller pieces for all the herb. The chicken Margherita was a great dish. It has all bell and whistle for the farm to table item. The chicken is pounded and breaded with right crust. It sauce is amazing. I would definitely go for this dish. Very pleasant to enjoy this dish. \n\nThe service is great. The only thing for the restaurant is not much choice on the protein side. Only chicken, sausage, meat ball. It will be difficult to grab hold on the the customers to visit from out side of David Island. Don't get me wrong, this is good restaurant.",

Winning the support of the customers is important. Such as doing something different than other Mediterranean cuisine restaurant typically do. One improvement can be done definitely has all dinner or meal with multi sides to accompany. Currently they allow one side which I feel to little and not comparable to the near by restaurant has done. \n\nI have chicken kabab and the lamb chop dinner. The chicken kabab I choose the baba ghanoush. The Baba ghanoush was delicious. The chicken was grilled with juicy meat and marinated sauce. It is a good dish to have. The lamb chop I have choose the yellow rice. The lamb chop was very nicely done. As I said above, for the price they have, they may want to include another side.",

    "text": "It one of good seafood place in Dunedin. This restaurant is about 4.5 stars. The reason they stay at 4 stars due to service during lunch time. They have one waiter and reception for the afternoon. I can see 6 table of customers but not enough waitress. Obviously this is a balancing act for the restaurant if they need to spend more overhead. \n\nWith that said. The food are excellent. 5 stars. We started with fried crab crawl. This is special of the day. $12 for about 20 crawls. The crawl is fresh with great coating. Love it. \n\nOur main dish is oyster poboy and the blackened hogfish. They give a lot of oyster at the poboy. The oyster are great. My friend was not able to finish and take home. The hogfish blackened is ok. Not like the Cajun style. But the fish meat is good and tasty. It is good sandwich. \n\nOverall experience is good. Hope they continue the good food.",

I believe many enjoy the food once they have the sashimi. \n\nRestaurant is kind of tuck away in the plaza. Not visible to the Main Street. We got bento box special and the Arizona roll. We are kind of in hurry for a movie but we didn't tell them so. However, the speed of the serving, we were able to finish at 35 minutes. \n\nI like my bento box. It has sashimi, sushi, California roll, goyoza, teriyaki chicken, tempura shrimp and veggies. Accompanying with salad and soup. I like the way they prepared the sashimi. The fish was glazed with sesame oil. Nice touch. The temperature is crispy and evenly spread of flour. I like they special made goyoza. The infill include meat and scallions. Very nice. All fish is in good size. \n\nOverall very good experience.",

    "text": "100 Montaditos is actually 100 items of montaditos. It is the bun with the tapas item insert. This is new concept chain restaurant from Spain. The first store in the bay area is start at the Wire Grass Mall. We have been here two nights and finally I can gather the fact for this review.\n\nI won't say I have tried each of items but I have enough for the general ideal of the concept. Although they have 100 different montaditos but their main ingredient as follow: Serrano ham, chorizo (sausage slice), salchichon (cure sausage), Lomo (dry cure pork-best item), Chistorra (basque sausage slice), tortilla, meatball, shrimp, tuna, philly steak, blue cheese, mozzarella, ground beef patty, hot dog, chicken, BBQ pull pork, garlic pork lion (one of the best), brie cheese, goat cheese, smoked salmon, anchovies. With this combination, they created the 95 items. The remaining 5 are the deserts. Although they have two different bun and the cost start at $1 to $3. The best pick are the Serrano ham, Lomo, Garlic Pork Lion. The manchego cheese is the 3 month cure cheese from Spain is also available. They have bigger platter such as calamari, croquette, and chicken wing. You also can order the cured meat alone.\n\nFor the visit, the new opening attracts lot of customer during the lunch and dinner time. When they don't have line, it is best to order as little as possible to keep the food warm. Then order the next item as you need. Every Wednesday all the montaditos is $1. I feel that we have too much bun by the time we have finish the meal. Although they are filling but do not give me the sensation as Tapas. The service is great. The team of the waiter and waitress is almost like the bee group that work around you.",
