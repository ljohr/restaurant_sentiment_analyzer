Only one of our members get the food late. The close out may need to work on it. Tip was added since we have large group which may my bill easy. \n\nI have order the lamb kebab (Shish Kebab) plate. It come with two choices of side. I got the rice and the babaghanoush. The rice was well cook and nice aroma. The babaghanoush was well prepared and great with extra olive oil. The presentation of the dish is pleasant. However, the meat did not measured up. It was too dry and the marinated is not over the top. They need to improve on this area. \n\nI have been here several time. My previous experience is better. During the month of Ramadan, they serve the buffet that are plenty of choices and attractive. I would said try them during this time. The buffet of Ramadan usually start at 8:30. Go early because is a lot of customers.",

A lot eye candy in the restaurant with my wife. Strange.  \n\nMy wife was at the restaurant first and she order ahead. I follow to the restaurant in 10 minutes. She order the lunch special with Chinese stir fry. Chinese food in winghouse? May be not. Her food came out like frozen section ready to cook meal from the Publix. I would not go for their Monday special. \n\nThey have two selection of fish sandwich in the menu. Grouper cousin or Mahi Mahi. Grouper cousin is one type of white fish. I definitely go for the real name fish- the Mahi Mahi. It can be grilled, blackened or deep fried. I have it grilled. The blacken Mahi Mahi is not the spicy type I like but it do have a good taste. This sandwich is better than their daily special. \n\nThe service is average. However, I think they need to be faster for lunch. Most people only have one hour.",

I like their decorations. \n\nWe were sit immediately on second small room. Including us is about three tables of customers. We have ordered Black pepper basil crispy duck and Spicy noodle with squid. Food delivery is on time. The black pepper basil squid is average. The spicy noodle seem like not cook in high heat because I cannot taste the burn oil. Both dish is actually made for American Thai flavor. The local may like it but I am looking for good Thai which is average. \n\nThe service is not measured up. We were not able to get attention of our waitress. But the other two tables was able grab her attention. Some how we got ignored. The three stars for the food and the service we have experience.",

Today I have the shave prime rib basket with upgrade to onion ring ($1 more) and my wife have the Atlantic cod basket with upgrade to shake ($2 more).\n\nThey give you a number and the food was brought to the table. This is plus that you don,t need to wait for your order at the counter. The food came in 5 minutes. \n\nThe shave prime rib is a bit salty. The onion ring and the cod came with a thick fried beard coating at the cover. To do the coating for deep fried have two method. The wet flour with material then fried or dry flour with material then fried. This restaurant chose the wet coating. As a result there is oil in the coating if you don't sit the food for a while and serve. \n\nThe service is good. However, I am not a fan for the wet coating. I believe the restaurant can improve on this front.  I not against the fry food but against the oily food due oil residue can be tasted at the onion ring coating.",

When you order extreme, it cover by other ingredients. The grouper and the steak is average for my experience. But the pastor is tasty and well seasoning. \n\nOverall their price is at the high side. Naked taco is about $2.79 each. The extreme taco is $3.79. For this price I usually treat them at restaurants level. Which they are not. Overall they are good.",

We have the stack - slow cook pork on sushi rice top with claw slaw. The rice is not my liking. The pork are sweet. The final dish Mauna Kea Keck II - slow cook beef on the spinach with twin scoop of rice. The beef is average. The rice definite needs improvement. \n\nOverall the service is very good.

The panini is good. Chicken was grilled. Accompanied fries was crispy. The Margherita is a flatbread top with chop steak with mozzarella cheese. It very good. Overall the food is good. The wait is a bit longer for the food. \n\nThe reason is three stars is due to waiter didn't pay attention to the table. Even we try to flag him down. Lunch during office hour usually is short.

Their protein included Tuna, Salmon and especially the Scallops. Their scallops are sea scallops with giant size scallops. Do you know Tarpon Springs has scalloping your. The shrimp is cooked with seasoning and very nice. Other worthy mention is the octopus protein. \n\nNow, the bad side. The base. The rice is too soft and not hard enough. Like old people food. Seem like too much water to use for cooking the rice. The sushi rice not really taste like sushi rice preparation. Very limited of the mixed in. Second. They only allow number of choice for mixed in. Compare to other place, many offer unlimited selection. Third. The sauce like ponzu, soy sauce, eel sauce all are too watery. Fourth, I can see when they pick up the mixed in, the water from the mixed in containers are drip into your poke. \n\nOne thing for sure, their poke is fresh enough.",

At least they no longer let the customers to figure out the food on the counter. \n\nWe were here for the taco week to celebrate the administrative day. Most of my guest got two tacos and a drink with about $10. I got the grilled fish and grilled shrimp. It is tasty for the two tacos I have selected. I like the grilled shrimp better. It has some blackened seasoning on it. \n\nI got the margarita for my combination deal. The margarita start light then feel the alcohol effects later. We enjoy our time there.",

The live seafood section need to clean their tank often. The MD in this location employees training need to know how heavy a bag can carry. Today I have two break bag due to the over weight of the bag can carry. They should learn double bag or less items in the bag. \n\nIt is good to see the fresh produce.

The waffle also come with the roasted walnut. This dish is decent. I also has the bowl of soup with southern clam chowder. Not much of clam. And the clam is tiny. My friend order the tuna melt.

Amphitheater on the east, center fountain, west veteran memorial. Surrounding the fountain red bricks are the name of the donors who contribute to the cost for building it. \n\nThe park is clean. See a lot of police patrol at the area. There many homeless people there hanging around. Basically they have no place to go and the park provide tree shade and benches. \n\nThere are concrete sidewalk around the park for leisure strolling. A lap on the park is 0.24 mile.

Selection of the wine is just average. \n\nThere are several thing they can improve. The portion of the plate is small compared to the Bay Area wine bar kitchen. Food pallet is at the sour side. If they can improve this two, it may be great attraction to the customers. Food price on the small plate is at the high side. Flavor and taste still need big improvement. \n\nI have the blacken octopus and seared tuna. The octopus is one tentacles. Which is small for the price they charging. The sauce can be more complicate by not stay on one sauce. May be grilled a bit better. The seared tuna coating can be improved. Not impressive. It is almost like Japanese tuna sashimi. If the outside is seared, it can include some awesome seasoning. May be smaller cute but more piece which provides more are of the seared outward tastes. \n\nOverall, they are try to sell the wine which the taste of the food need to be more attractive.",

This taco come with skirt steak, Cotija cheese, and pickle. We don't know the Cotija cheese is. Very similar to goat cheese. This kind of cheese either you love it or hate it for the taste. I think this is a wrong move for the restaurant. Because you may have 50% of people don't like it. Steak is a bit over cook. \n\nOur second dish is the Chimichurri Steak Frites. This dish is a lot better. We order the medium rare. A few thing can improve on is the temperature serving below warm. The dish is serve over wood cutting board is not my standard. I know they try to create the impression. But for me I don't like to eat with cutting board already being cut through with a lot of cut mark below. Even though the board is clean but never guaranteed if the cut mark is fully clean. I prefer it to serve of the plate. \n\nWith that price charge for the dish, we will have high expectations. However it was not met. Services is great. Good attentive service. I like the decoration and atmosphere. Parking very limited when the place is full.",

This store shave ice is big pieces compare to many snow cone venders. The correct way of the shave ice is tiny pieces like puffy cotton. I believe they can adjust many revolutions with slightly press to create that. Unfortunately, the store tries to save energy, and make the shave ice not delight to eat. With that, they should have 2 stars.\n\nHowever, the Dip Top did the best job among the menu and save the day. The soft serve with the Cherry dip top is handsome looking and delicious to eat.

This restaurant do have excellent reviews but my experience did not match up the rated stars. \n\nThe Sun City has a lot Mexican restaurant that you can pick. Los Amigos is the popular one at local. I think they are highly rated because of the local.  We were here at 1:20 pm and they are still 80% full. People still coming in after we have sit down. \n\nIt was difficult to get the wait staff attention for getting a menu or initial an order. I have decided to take manner at my own hand to grab one of the staff and ordered immediately. After my order, I saw at least three tables customer walk out the restaurant without order. This is a sign of either not enough staff or lack of attention. \n\nWe have order the beef rib with green enchiladas and breaded steak. My friend breaded steak is average. My beef rib come with three pieces. At least 1.5 pieces is over cook or charcoal. I can see why they are popular because their food is good deal. \n\nA few things they can improve. Increase number of wait staff. The kitchen staffs may need to paid attention on cooking.",

Right now only one picnic table in patio. \n\nThe reason there are 3.5 stars is from order to pickup requires 40 minutes. It is take too long just to serve 7 customers. This need to be big improvement especially for the first time customer who just order there. \n\nI got the two pieces chicken. I think their chicken is too dry. Seem like out of smoker and to the grilled for long like. The rib sandwich was good. I like the dry rub. It has good flavor. The devil egg is something, you can get three egg with different meat. The sausage sandwich is the best deal and good bite. It is long enough. Smoke wing is better. \n\nMostly the food are smoke flavor.  The smoke did the good job into the meat.

However, they run out of yellowtail. So go for the tuna only. A few things I don't like. The price is about restaurant price for food court mentality. You have stand in line to get food. The portion is small compared to many of you pick poke. The quality is in the mix review. The meat has good quality but it has a lot of tuna tip end. The meat is not cube size. \n\nFor the price.

This is how it get the name. \n\nOverall my experience is average. I think the servers are run out of the energy to serve us. They seem tire at the last hour before closing.

This is their best seller. \n\nWhen we have visited the store, they run out of bacon maple donut. I choose other options. I have the new chocolate banana. It is drizzle with chocolate and the filling is banana flavor. The chocolate touch is ok. The infill is better. I am use to Bavarian creme but banana creme is better. \n\nMy wife has the apple fritter. This is a strange donut but interesting. When we visit them, they almost closing up the store. So the donut has been sit for some time. I will reevaluate them when I revisit them. The only complaint is they close at 12:00 everyday. This is only morning business.",

If not I have to paid three individual scoop cost. I would said the three scoops mash together is not good. Flavor mixed up. With no taste try, I can tell you 2 out out of three are not my favorite. I would throw away the other two. The best is still the crowd favorite the chronic popcorn. \n\nWith above reason, the about 2.5 stars. Next give a bigger bowl when I ask for it to separate the scoop. The request is reasonable but they did not provide it.",

This all you can eat concept is a copy from the other Japanese restaurant in New Tampa. They will be judged and compared to the similar restaurant. \n\nTonight we are trying this restaurant because they are recently open and new in the Bay Area. We have dinner buffet and they limited each person to 8 pieces of the sashimi if you have dinner buffet. The Sunday dinner buffet is $17.99 not $15.99 per the web site. Tonight we have order the following:\nSpicy Tuna Roll - 2 Stars\nSpicy Salmon Roll - 2 Stars\nShrimp Tempura Roll - 3 Stars\nRainbow Roll - 3 stars\nCrazy Roll - 3 stars\nLady In Red Roll - 3 stars\nSaki Roll - 4 Stars\nThe Coconut shrimp should not be calling in that name. Most recognize coconut shrimp is fried with coconut flake. This is just the wet flour coating fried with sweet mayo. It is different than my friend Rachel M. posted picture. I wonder they start changing their quality. The Hibachi squid is not near to the standard with most hot plate includes the minor burn of the squid. The sashimi is better since they are base on the cut. The best of the sashimi is the surf clam. This is the most value of the dish. The hibachi tofu is perfect for taste and texture. The fried scallop is not the true scallop - disappointed. Age tofu is OK. \n\nThis section is to evaluate the chef skill and material. The spicy tuna is process with food processor. As a result, they are lumpy. The correct way is to chop in pieces and mix with correct spice and quail egg. By chopping it create the texture of the tuna and preserve the quality. The food processor just a short cut. Same as the spicy salmon is process that way. After I eat the sushi, I can smell the fish smell around my lip, although they are fresh but they are not the best quality due to the smell. They should not call out coconut shrimp or scallop to give customer a misconception where they are not prepare in those ingredient. \n\nThis restaurant will require a lot of improvement not just the chef skill. They also need to improve the flavor of each roll to show it is not too plain. I am thinking this restaurant is 2.5 star bases on the comment above but I am given three stars. I hope they can have dramatic improvement for the next time I am visit.",

I found myself lost looking at the menu. However, they still have different type of crepes in the menu. I love their crepe. That may be the only thing not change. But they did add chicken florentine crepe. I got to try that and they my new found love here. The crepe is cook along side with the wrapping ingredients. The ingredients are chopped chicken breast, spinach, mushroom, onion. These ingredients are stir fry and add on top of crepe then top with Swiss cheese. The cheese melt away and the crepe top with hollandaise sauce. This is creeeeepy day for me. But they are good. \n\nOverall the pricing with the food some good value and some are not. Service is great.",

The six major things they are serving is wings, fish, shrimp, Philly cheese, burger and fried rice. Food price is in the middle of fast food chain. \n\nThere are three different fish you can choose. Whiting, Tilapia or Catfish. The catfish will have a dollar difference. I got the fried shrimp and whiting for $9.99 which includes the drinks. Ok deal. My wife have the Philly cheese steak and the six wings with teriyaki sauce. Cheese steak is good. The chicken is fried correctly. Not much can said about the food. They are not wow factor but does the job. No standout taste. \n\nI do like other than food, you can get specialty drink with boba. We have cappuccino and mango slush. It just need to add the upgrade fees. Overall is good.",

The pictures that were posted and presentation of the sushi is pleasant.\n\nI got the scorch earth, spicy tuna, and eel avocado. Spicy tuna and the eel avocado is the lunch special with two rolls for $9.45. Those rolls are good deal. I like the tuna is dice in big pieces. Then sauce up with some spiciness. The eel was well presented.\n\nThe scorch is their gimmick sushi. I like it because they torch the top of the sushi. Some how I don't like the sauce on top. I don't like their spicy mayo. Too much mayo kind of not match the ingredients. I would rather they slice the sushi instead of dice and put on the top. That way the torch has more flavor over the meat. \n\nIt is mix reviews for me. The service can be better. The servers are congregate on the their service aisle instead of pay attention to the customers. This can be improved.",

He just sit at register for taking order but still slow. The kitchen crew are more alert. They got your order and fried the chicken immediately. \n\nThe Nashville style chicken is using wet batter coating systems. Most of the fried chicken place use dry powder battering then fried immediately. This place have coating mixed with spice and wet it with water. The chicken then dip into the wet coating and fried. This system is more challenging. The Chinese fried chicken is like this system. Why they are 3.5 stars is because the coating getting compact and concentrated. Which mean the oil is old and repetitive fried. The fresh oil or change the oil so often will make the chicken better coating. \n\nOne best thing is the seasoning and the Nashville hot is very well receptive. This is not like Asian hot that numb you mouth and could not taste the food. The hot is acceptable by many Americans. You still can taste the hot heat and the food in the right amount of chili. This I would give them an \"A\". Price is about most fried chicken place. But I do like their fried and the pickle. It was good.",

We are here to try out the food for the first time.\n\nThe restaurant has the two choices for the food. You can pickup by cafeteria already cook or from the menu. We have order two dishes from the cafeteria and one from the menu. The first dish is a soup with tripe, pig feet, and veggie. Most people only cook tripe soup by it own. It is good twist with the pig feet. Good soup. \n\nThe second dish is a tomato base whole fish. It look awesome but it not my liking taste. Fish meat is too loose. The third dish is a cook up dish of grill steak with onion. I can hear they pound the steak at the kitchen. I like my steak grilled with no sauce. But Dominican steak has sauce on top but a bit salty. \n\nThe food is average. If I choose Latin food, I would go with Cuban style bistec. Service is cafeteria style.",

We got several one with colorful display. Some of them are very interesting. We also got their juice as sugar cane. However this is a let down. They give you a small cup and expensive in dollar. I can get better quantity with double of the amount they have offer in Tampa Bay Area. \n\nOverall is a specialty food center. You can get a hot plate with good price.

We were lucky to get a table. People who behind us have to wait. \n\nThe food is good. I have Paisa Bandeja Hacienda with upgrades steak. This dish has steak, chicharon, blood sausage, regular sausage, rice, egg, plantains, bean soup. A lot to offer. The chicharron is a little tough to bite de to the skin is or crispy. Like rubber. This can improve by changing the frying oil and keep it crispy. The rest item is a little above average. My wife love her dish. She has Filete de Pescado al Ajillo. The Ajillo sauce is great. I would highly recommend this dish. It is one of the kind. \n\nThe reason they are 3 star is the wait for the food is too long. We waited almost 40 minutes. No wonder the restaurant always pack because everyone is waiting for their food. The chicharron is a typical dish which they must master before anything else. I hope my next visit they can improve on that. They have bakery section. To me is just ok. Bit my wife like it.",

Later it filled up with another 6 table before we left the restaurant. They are not that busy. They also advertise you can watch the Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao 5/2/2015 fight there. Manny Pacquiao is Pilipino super lightweight boxer. \n\nThe waitress is kind to explain to us each dish and what materials are used.  We have started two appetizers. The chicken wing with adobo glaze and the chicken sisig lettuce wrap. We like the chicken sisig. I think if they add some sweet sauce, it will make this dish more attractive. The chicken wing is fried. They are nicely fried plainly. Then it adds the adobo glaze sauce. The chicken wing batter before fried can be adding some spice to enhance the flavor. \n\nThe dishes are beef toscilog, Crispy pata kare kare, mixed grill. The beef toscilog come with half cook egg that you can break the egg yolk and mix with the rice. The pan grill beef make this dish desirable. The crispy pata is the fried pig feet. The pig feet are the lower part of the leg. I prefer upper part which has more meat. The pig feet are fried and I like the other sauce instead of kare kare sauce. \n\nThe mixed grill is the squid, pork belly, chicken and eggplant. Among them I like the grilled eggplant. This is the most expansive dish in the menu $32. Three of us stomach did not receive the food well for this dish. We believe the squid is not the fresh material that causes this. \n\nBase on Filipino food, the price is at the high side. Quality of material is not the best such as the squid. Service is slow and checks back frequently. Restaurant is well decorated. I think it is worth for a try and been there done that type of deal.",

If you want to sit at normal level, you may want to choose the outside patio seating. Obviously they try to imitate the beer hall type atmosphere with high top seats but it will be challenging for lady with dress. \n\nThis restaurant is open about a month. They still did not get the kink out. The food wait is about 35 minutes. Waiting staff afraid to approach you since you are waiting for the food. We got the habanero wings and the short rib. The wing is actually Buffalo wing with honey ranch type dipping sauce. I am not impressed due to 8 wings for $11 and is just regular buffalo wing. I expect more for the price paid $1.5 a wing with tax. The name not measure up. \n\nThe short rib is a fan. I like it when they braised it or slow temperature long hour grilled. The out side was crispy and nice. This short rib top with sweet mushrooms sauce with cabbage and place over pancakes. This is a great dish. \n\nOverall the service need to improve, the food waiting time need to cut down, may be grilled the wing with honey after the buffalo sauce was applied will make this wing worth $1.5 a piece.

The phone ring is almost not off the hook. Good thing they have parking around the building. Tables and chairs are provided inside and court yard. There is heavy seafood smell in the building. If you don't like the smell, you can sit outside. \n\nThe seafood here is good price. Catfish or Basa fillet are $4.99 a lbs. they also offer fried seafood platter. We ordered the seafood platter include shrimp, scallops and clam. It is good deal with the entire box fill up till it hard to close the lid. The platter also includes fries and hush puppies. The seafood was fried with batter coating. For my experience, the coating is too thick and no added spice. It is kind of plain. You will need drink to go with the seafood. The positive of the platter is the shrimps are in good size. \n\nThis is a local favorite and many has visit. The food come out quick.",

At least I see 5 table occupied. \n\nI got the Hu Tieu. It is a seafood Hu Tieu. It has the squid, shrimp, fish ball, shrimp ball. This dish cost $7.50 for small. I have ask them to add the fish cake also. They have charge me extras $2. It is a 25 % mark up. It is a bit steep. The noodle is good and the seafood is fresh. I think the soup is a bit let down due to lack of flavor and the enhanced of fried onions and fried pork fat.  If they can stir fried the pork fat ant onion before adding the soup, it will enhance the taste. \n\nOverall is good. Services is average. Nothing to boast about. It is been there done that deal. Pinellas Park has too many good Vietnamese food. It will be a good competition.",

Although they are not cheap but is about a dollar to 2 dollars lower different in the Bay Area. \n\nWe have three dishes tonight. We start with Galbi the Korean grilled short rib. The dish is $23 with about 11 pieces of short rib. It was great marinated sauce to the bone. The second dish is the Eemyoonsoo the fried Atlanta Mackerel with lightly salted. This is a whole fish. The size is medium for $17. The edge and top was fried to crispy and crunch. A very good dish to go with beer or rice wine. The last dish is Dolsot Bibimbob. The rice serve in stone bowl. That make the rice burn to crispy at the stone touch edge. This dis has egg, veggies, beef. But I think it is less flavor. They need to work on this dish. \n\nThey are better than most Korean restaurants in Tampa. You still need to wait for the food for a while but the wait time is shorter than the Korean restaurants in Tampa. I still say they need to work on the speed to deliver the food to table. Don't let the customers wait too long. Service is typically as bad as most Korean restaurants.",

Because they are systematically layout, they are not flexible to change for their meat selection. For instance if I want just capicola ham only, I will not be able to buy that. I have to select the entire Italian cut including pepperoni, salami. The reason they give is each portion is precut and assembled. You will not be able to twist and change. If I want extra meat, you have to paid entire assembly. \n\nThe sandwich is good taste for Italian, the balsamic sauce is great. But I feel sandwich assembly is thin not wide enough.

Or you can get the dolphin watch. You also can rent the wave runner. \n\nThe bad side- the high parking fee discourages the local to visit. Why we waste tax money for making this place good but it charges you a lot on parking. The restaurant also did not make a good deal of it. Because of the tourist spot, their price is normally high. As a result, the village has narrow to only tourist.",

The restaurant is at prime location at the mall entrance. They got very good customer base. The restaurant is 80% pack in the early dinner hour. \n\nWe got two items from happy hour, we have the oysters and the medium neck clam. Both dishes was fresh and delicious. My wife have fish and chips. The fish is in good large piece. It also has crispy coating. It is good dish with the fries. I have the crab cake. I think the crab cake is below average. I think it has too much dough than crab meat. It do come with string beans and rice. The side dish is a choice from menu. \n\nOverall experience is good. It is about 3.5 stars. I still think if their menu can be re-engineering with attractive dish in use seasoning, cook method, or flavor, they will do very well.",

This pub not populated with TV. It can be more but enough for each corner. \n\nThis pub food and drink price a generally a dollar more than the other pub. The wings after tax is about $1.3x per wing. Average wing price at USF and New tampa is about $1.00. As a result, we expect to be spectacular. I have blacken wing. The wing is fried correctly. The blackened spice is not so. I think can be improved. I wonder if they have grilled stove. If they do the grilled will add flavor into it. That can be improved easily. \n\nI like new business because they really bring value to the community. In the same time, they need to be reasonable. I know they invest a lot in a business. So far they have the customers and it is time to correct.",

This may be your place. Price is at the medium. The food is similar to take out place Chinese food. But they have few house special dish. I was going to try their smoke duck. However, they didn't carry this dish that night. So we change our selection to lobster and shrimp dish and happy family dish. The lobster is deep fried to crispy and the shrimp is cook with hibachi sauce. It is almost like two dish in one combination. Lobster is fresh and so do the shrimp. The happy family is combination of the ingredients with shrimp, scallops, chicken and beef. Within that dish, the beef is the best. \n\nI cannot tell the about the service since there is only two tables of customers. Chef skill and use of spice need big improvement. Ingredients are good.",

    "text": "Neighborhood Taco Bell for drink and snack. I have never use their food for meal. But I do like their select item over Mc Donald for snack. \n\nI here mainly for the happiest hour soft drink. During 2pm to 5pm each day, the drink is a dollar. I usually get the Baja blast freeze. They do have other choice like the pomegranate water, other flavor of freeze. Taco Bell generally is healthy choice than Mc Donald in the fast food chain. I remember an old futuristic movie \"Demolition Man\" shows the only surviving franchise in the future is Taco Bell. The movie shows the people with healthy living and change society and the Taco Bell is the high class restaurant. Imagine that is all we eat in the future???\n\nI also like their snack for the crunchy taco or the steak quesadilla. Love the steak quesadilla here. If they can only using just the Swiss cheese, I will know at their door often.",

I like old thick crust pizza, I am not a fan of tin crust. If you have to pig out, please go all out with no reservation. At that point you have blown the calories count any how. \n\nTonight they have the $5 two topping deal large pizza. It is enough for me and my wife. We have order the pepperoni and bacon. I call in 10 minutes before my pickup and they are ready on time. The two topping deal only on the carry out. Please make a trip to nearby pizza place. The total come to $6. Great value. \n\nThey lay the pepperoni then the bacon on top. The pepperoni is great and crispy. With bacon on top the juice of bacon further cook the pepperoni to give extra crispy. The bacon is great in this sense. Everything go well with bacon. \n\nPlease catch the deal while they last.",

    "text": "I was so look forward to try Blake Crab Cake. I like lump crab meat. Especially they serve Maryland style crab cake. The store is small compared to many restaurant. It is almost like take out. The list of the item was written at the board. I would said this will one of the unique store serve this type of cuisine. \n\nWe got the crab cake and the blue crab fingers claw. The crab cake is deep fry with flour. It does not look like lump crab look that the business picture. As a result, I think is a step down. When the flour and crab meat fried together is not the same just the crab lump meat alone. It will be different. The blue crab claw is delicious. But I think instead of old bay seasoning, the blacken claw is better. \n\nThe experience is just make the mark. Nothing fancy. Portion is a bit small. 5 oz crab cake for $12 is at the high side.",

I have to agree with Mark and Brian for three stars. \n\nThis visit we have order the Beef Rendang, Hainanese Chicken, and Char Quey Teow. Below are the reasons they are average. The beef rendang is at right spice. However they are very mild in spice. They are not spicy. But if you request a spicy beef. They should be able to tone up or down on the spiciness of food by add additional step to prepare in the kitchen. This option was not available. The Hainanese Chicken suppose to be broil and chill in cold water with same process for many time to get the tenderness. But I think just broil once. \n\nThe Char Quey Teow should be dry out stir fry wok cooking. One positive note. All food has the Malaysian taste. It has good spice.",

There are not much good mom and pop restaurant in the area to compete. They are really located at good spot for business. \n\nWe got the Churrasco and Bistec Empanado. The churrasco is the skirt steak. Their skirt steak cut like a strip with about 1\" diameter and 7\" long. I prefer to thin and at Falda cut which they don't carry. The marinated sauce is good. The steak is cook to medium not like my order medium rare. Overall is a good dish. The Bistec Empanado is breaded thin steak. The breaded coating has no taste. I have been many Latin restaurant have better coating than them. \n\nOne other thing. We walk into the restaurant and there was no line on Tuesday night. The hostess still saying we have to wait for ten minutes for table. I see there is open table. At the end we choose the bar instead of waiting. Service is not attentive. Many area of the restaurant need to improve. Service, hostess, food.",

I walk around and found empty tables but they are not occupied by anyone. I went to check when is our turn, they lead me to the same empty table that I found 5 minutes ago. The seat is just below the AC vent. I can feel the drip of the water. They definitely need to check this vent on their off hour. Make sure water molecules is contained. \n\nThe only thing I like about this place is the service on the table and the food. Which is the most important. My wife has the Thai Coconut-Lime Chicken. It a bit lime heavy at the end. The best is the Hibachi Steak. It is the hunger steak with shiitake mushrooms in slice, caramel onion and sprout. It also included the wasabi mash potatoes and tempura asparagus. This steak is cook with the ginger sauce which is a good match. \n\nService is good over the dining time. Food come out the right time compare to my last visit. I would said the hostess need to paid attention to the empty table. Customers is less patient when exceed to the wait acknowledge time. The AC vent need to be clean and make not dripping water. Who know what dust has the water has collected.",

Wait for table is 45 minutes, wait for the food after order is 25 minutes, waitress is beat up and tired. Not sure how many table they have to take care. Hostess tell you 30 to 45 minutes wait is definitely 45 minutes. They need to clean up the table sooner and allow to clear the queue wait line. Since you have to wait for the food, it make wait line longer. \n\nOne thing they can improve dramatically is make sure each order come out quickly which will reduce the wait.

Seem like the bun was sit there some time. We got the special combination banh mi and grilled pork banh mi. One compliment can give is the grey paste did a good job. The meat for special and grilled pork are just average.",

I am excited and looking forward to try the new restaurant. \n\nPositive note: the service is great at this place. Since they just opening, all furniture and deco is rather new. It is interesting to see new restaurant is on their feet. The order is easy to spot on for the selection. Food came with good quantity in some. \n\nThe food: we have order the three different front of the menu. The bento box for the cooking skills; the sushi for the technique; and the ramen to compare to the rest of ramen place. \n\nThe bento box is average. The salmon can be seasoning and pan seared and burn a bit to get the crispy of the fish meat. The goyaza is tasty. The sushi roll is just the average with no wow factor. The sushi rice can be better prepared with better taste. The fish is low quality or cut in bad technique. Cannot tell too much but not impressed by it. One positive is the ramen. The miso soup base is flavored. They are the restaurant gave the most charshu pork in the Bay Area. The noodle of the ramen is a bit too soft, this can be easily improved. \n\nI would said I have been here and check off. Good for people in short duration of the lunch time.",

    "text": "Company christmas party today and take place at StarShip Dinner Cruise. Today cruise include the holiday boat parade at David island. We have 32 people on board this ship and occupied 4 tables. The boarding is 4:30 pm and the boat light parade is at 7 pm. The boarding went perfect. \n\nSince this is company party, the drink is on the company. Our table order the a bottle of Kenwood Pinot noir from Russian River of Sonoma county. The server went on the whole ship inventory search and cannot find the wine on the menu. \n\nThis dinner cruise actually has a buffet style food. Today buffet menu include roast beef, Roast Boneless Chicken Breast Stuffed with Spinach & Sun Dried Tomatoes, finished with a Pesto Cream Sauce, Fillet of Salmon with a Dill Cream Sauce, Bowtie Pasta with Mushrooms. The food is good and tasty. \n\nAfter the first plate, the wine have not arrive yet. We asking the server again. 15 minutes later they bring a Pinot noir with mascot. This is actually a dresser wine. At that time we are go with it. The server need to be trained how the wine work and pairing to the food. You don't pair desert wine with the food. As a result we treat it as a desert wine. \n\nThe dinner is completed and I look for the desert table. All desert is gone and it take them another 15 minute to bring the new one. As a result I ask the server go to the kitchen to bring the one I like. \n\nThe highlight of the night is after the dinner there is an upper deck dance floor and viewing area for the holiday boat parade. \n\nOverall I am not satisfy with the service. They could come to me quickly and tell me they run out of wine in the beginning. With the desert run out of choice and the wine situation I am giving 2.5 star. Since the yelp do not have half star, I give them 3 star due to the DJ on the deck and smooth sail.",

They can survive the business because far away from the hub. It would not be able to survive if it is located at the Dale Mabry or Pinellas Pho hub. The soup is average. Not the top notch.

By the time it finishes is closed to 11:00 PM. \n\nThe parade compose of the Chorus Girl Project, The Disco Group, Roux's Cabaret, dance studio, several high school band and cheer leader. There is King and Queen Float that give out special bead medallion. Their floats are beautiful to display to public. They elephant, purple swan, Jesuit, The Greek Statues, Butterfly, Baby catching the Bug, Mermaid, and The Secret Heart. All this floats has people throwing the beads to the spectator. The best offend is the best defend. Basically you have to raise your hand up to protect yourself from getting hit by the beads. You will not know where and when the beads arrive. As a result, raising your hand can block the beads hit your face and catch it at the mid air. The bead throwers are crazy. Since we are close to end of parade route, the beads were throw in who bag that was not open or large amount in spray pattern. \n\nOur hotel has to put out the beads recycle bin for the excess amount of beads that you don't want to carry home. We are one of the people has to put our beads in this bin every night since there is new one tomorrow. The Canal street center aisle is the great area to catch both side of the parade if you want shower of beads. I say again shower of beads. It is insane amount of beads if you are in that aisle. They are also throwing the stuff toy. You will definite enjoy when you collect so much free items in large beg.",

I always seen a lot of them employees but did not see they actually care or clean the store. \n\nThe shaken tea with pineapple black tea is refreshing. It is better and cheaper than their coffee. They do have other drink like infusion lemonade and chai tea latte. They also has strawberry acai. I thinks they are branch out from just coffee.",

The second dish is the Chicken Do Pyaza. This is another curry with onion, ginger and garlic. I cannot make out what kind of Indian base spice. The third dish is the Garlic Tandoori Shrimp. I think the meat is not bouncy enough may be due to grilled in the oven for long time. This dish is too sour which I think it will be better without the lemon. The fourth dish is the chicken tikka. This roasted marinated chicken. I couldn't tell how much different than chicken tandoori. \n\nOverall is good. Not really wow. But definitely good curry.

The restaurant has inside and outside seating. I went straight to the bar since I am solo that day. The bar has good display of alcohol bottles. \n\nThe menu for the brunch hour is extensive. Selection is wide range. Base on the yelp picture, the steak and egg is popular. But one of the menu item changes my mind. I got the lobster omelette. This dish has lobster, provolone, tomato and wrapped in the egg. The side is potatoes hash. The lobster is three little lobster crawl. I wish it has some body meat for the price we paid. \n\nThe service is good. Food come out quick. But the food didn't sit well with the stomach. Something not quite correct about the freshness.",

I want my noodles dry which mean don't let the juice come out. I also order it to be Thai spicy hot. While I wait for the food, they do have special day combination or pre prix dish on holiday. Look interesting. \n\nWhen my noodles come out, there are wet sauce every where. Which mean it was not on the wok too long. Because no burn mark at the noodles. The dish is medium spicy.

Some of the noodle are glued together. Seem like 5 Strings becomes one string. My wife noodle is very gooey. This is not acceptable. I think my noodle was sit for a while and my wife noodle was not processed correctly. In Asia, the noodle need to be broil and put in the cold water to cool off and the same time wash away the extra flour that attached to avoid gooey. This is the basic. I think their chef has not pay attention to our bowl and skip step. That cause the entire noodle are not good at all. If this happens in Asia, they will not be acceptable. \n\nI think with each bowl we paid $16 a piece. It is not to any standard and not to the art of ramen. Not worth the money.

    "text": "Some gourmet burger place. But I don't feel gourmet much. I think their burger just average. The burger is small. If you are big hungry man, this may not be your place. The meal deal won't be able to feed you. \n\nShake Shack is a yuppie restaurant. The burger patty is press to flat and grilled to crispy. Is is different kind of burger preparation. I would definitely give them a A+ on the sauce add on especially the truffle burger. The fried onion is just a bit on their truffle burger. Overall their best burger is the truffle burger. Bacon avocado burger is ok. Definitely is a good mixture of material. \n\nWith the size of burger and price paid, it is in the expensive side. I think they need to do something about the size of burger. Especially the new business to attract repeat customers.",

When you walk in the restaurant, the grilled was displayed on the side. The chicken is golden grilled. Look yummy. \n\nWe have take from this place before. They are a bit charcoal or burn. I decided to come in here and try. We have $10 coupon for whole chicken and two sides. Very good deal. The chicken is well cook this time. The comment I have for this place is the mojo marinate is too less. The marinate only skin deep compare to other pollo tropical. It need to go to the meat. \n\nThe service here is great and clean. Salsa can be obtained and taken at the salsa bar. I like the good deal. Order is quick. I like the color of the building.",

They do get a lot of local support especially their lunch special is attractive.\n\nWe got schnitzel Berlin and schnitzel Jaeger Art. Both are fried pork with sides. The Berlin Schnitzel is come with pepper corn sauce, red cabbage, bread dumplings. But I think the Schnitzel Jaeger Art is better. It is top with creamy mushroom sauce and spaetzle. However, both breaded pork are not crispy on coating. Taste is there, I feel they are in hurry to put pork out and not fried it longer. Coating also can be improved with more tasty spices in it. \n\nOverall is good. Popular for lunch. Service is good.",

When you make reservation, they call you back same day to confirm your reservation.\n\nWe went to this restaurant at Sunday Night and they are not busy. The reservation really not quite needed at Sunday.  No pre-meal items such as dip, bread, chip, or olive. We start our dinner with Crab Avocado Stack. This appetizer is well presented and well decorated. It drips with sweet base cilantro vinaigrette. They do give a lot of the lump crap. \n\nThe entrees are the fish and chips English food. The fish is grouper and we were allowed to change our chip to asparagus. The grouper is well made. Our second dish is Florida Black Grouper with brussel sprouts & mushroom hash, lobster essence. The brussel sprouts leaves are separated and stir fried with mushrooms and sweet potato hash. The lobster essence is just the orange color sauce. I cannot taste any lobster out of it. The grouper is pan seared. \n\nThe dishes are very simple, no sophisticate flavor. I wonder it do not worth the money for my opinion. If I come next time, I just go for the appetizers only. The service is too slow. It takes 15 minutes to wait for my check and I just want to get out of there.",

Now I can sit and eat the food at the restaurant since they open one in tampa. It Is long wait but worthies for the wait. \n\nTonight (Friday night) is one of the longer restaurant hour night that they have until 9 pm. We arrive at 6:27pm and the wait line build up to sidewalk of the restaurant side. The wait on the line is 25 minute. The different of this restaurant is they built their sweet item at different side of the order line. This actually reduce the wait time compare to the one at winter park location. This is a improvement. While we were waiting on the line the server bring up the small ketchup cup size try item six shooter for the taste. \n\nWe have order the Santa Maria Tri-Tip Steak and Smoke Prime Rib. We have added the half pound signature brisket. The side are the collar green, corn, sweet potato smash, and the bacon wrap jalape\u00f1o. The taste did not change from the original restaurant (Fairbanks Winter Park). The prime rib is juicy and tender. The brisket is well seasoning that enter to the meat it self. I love their their side because they extra effort to process it. If you fist time here, you should start with their brisket. \n\nIf you come here to have a nice dinner, this is not the place. You should come here just for the food since your food is serve on top of paper on the tray. It is BBQ joint that you need to get down or chow down. Expecting line will build up to the door.",

The air here is better than the one in the county line road at Wesley Chapel. The equipment is regularly clean. This is a plus. They need to think about how to have the member renew their membership.

The tandoori chicken has it flavor enter into the deeper part of the chicken. The lollipop chicken is great, but the hot plate only keeps it warm instead of hot. I like the curry eggplants. It go well with nan and the rice. The cost is under $10 for the buffet is considering good value.\n\nI like their soup of the day. I could not make up the ingredient for the soup but it is good. I like the food to be spicier. At the chili paste to make it spicy is not the same to cook it spicy. This restaurant did not give me a return immediately for more.

We normally don't do shabu shabu is due to the assembly material can be obtained in any oriental market and cook it yourself. \n\nWhat is shabu shabu. My family celebrating Chinese New Year with this cuisine because it can add anyone anytime by add additional material without involving heavy cooking. The New Year also fall in the winter time and they are cold outside and shabu shabu is the best part. There is a Chinese term for shabu shabu- hot pot. We actually have the charcoal in middle to broil the soup and heat up the pot. Now we have the electric broiler that not required charcoal and easy to control the temperature of the pot. \n\nThe material is easy. Just but the chicken and pork and remove the meat. The bone of the pork and chicken put into the soup and broil for the broth. This restaurant did not do that. All their soup is come in package of spice and added into the pot. They have the selection of the slice meat, meat or fish ball, dumpling, veggies, type noodles. They are not authentic since their soup is in package. \n\nEating the hot pot is topic the sauce correctly. The right sauce is important to dip on after you have broil your material. The service of the restaurant is slow. But they have each pot for each person. Something I don't understand is why they charge the soup to broil in addition to the material. I would suggest only charge when you want to upgrade the soup.",

I got their entree item with Sriracha Salmon. This dish well presented. They have good pieces of salmon steak with skin. The salmon is seared. Top with bacon and onion rings. The bed is broccoli slaw with Thai chili sauce. It is very good. The presentation of the food is top the chart. \n\nThe service is excellent and attentive. The price for the food is reasonable. The atmosphere is bar type. I would like to try their crawfish burger next time.",

I have to give them a compliment about more leg room. You also can purchase for more leg rooms if you like especially for longer flight. It more efficient to buy more leg room than pay double to triple for first class. \n\nCurrently the flight is on time. However, one thing I don't like is they combine with other airline to pack the entire plane. Sometimes you can see three Airlines combinations in one flight. It is packing tight.

Base on this combination experience, it is set to three stars. \n\nI believe Roy's has take a step back. When the food is not good, it will be no repeat customer. The reason as below. We start three appetizer crispy chicken spring rolls, Szechuan spice pork rib, and tempura crash Ahi Tuna roll. Among all three, only the tuna roll is good. The pork need major improvement. The meat not fall off the bone make this not a fine dinning experience. Obviously the rib was not slow cook longer allow meat to fall off. \n\nThe entr\u00e9e are the fillet mignon and macadamia nut crust mahi mahi. I have to send the fillet back because the meat was not cooked to order. This can corrected by putting a indicated stick not to mixed up the order. The mahi-mahi is just simply not fresh enough. The meat not show good sign. The crust is not fully cover to the fish. \n\nOne good thing can said about this experience is the dessert. All other just ok.",

I think they are more gear for short duration travel. If you have a same day business trip, this airline definitely a good deal. \n\nThis big yellow air bus is ok. The plane we took delay 30 minutes. But they did warn us about it. Many has bring their duffle bag or back pack. Just to avoid additional charges. But for a good non stop flight to Chicago is perfect. \n\nLeg room is just ok. Random seat assignment is free but if you decided to seat close to exit more leg room, you may want to paid extra. The seat is a bit un comfortable due to non reclining seat. In the same time, the padding on the seat is thin. Not good for long hour travel. \n\nDrink, snack or food is extra. When you paid the luggage service, you think you may get the luggage sooner. It end up we have to wait for 30 minutes. Overall experience is below par. But is I have a short trip, I may considering it.",

Very pleasant. \n\nService is below average in compare to the David Island store. Not many table is serving, but is a bit difficult to get hold of the waitress. May be this place is biggest and separated by a partition wall between the bar and dinning area. Seem like many waiters congregate on the bar area and not been able to see what happens to the dinning hall.",

We arrive 8:30 pm and they said if we could finish by 9:00 pm because they are closing. The food came out quick. I would said the food is as the food truck standard even though they serve in the restaurant. I would said some food truck may be has better wok cooking technique than their dish. \n\nOverall is a good experience. It is about 3.5 stars but they do have a lot of room to improve.

This is due to my recent visit and find their food not attractive. In fact, that can be tell from how many customers visited this restaurant. \n\nWe started with their Lobstah Tacos. We got the full menu 3 taco. Most of the meat is from the lobster crawl. I would not recommend use the tip meat at the crawl. They are powdery and not great. They need to mixed with body and crawl meat but remove the tip of the crawl meat. \n\nOur second dish is seafood poke bowl. Their poke is not attractive at all. With the same price, there are many poke place do better than them. This dish need a lot of improvement. The third dish is the key west crab cake sandwich. This dish is a little better. But I would use fully dungeons crab meat. Mixed other item and become the crab cake is a bit low side to impress the customers. \n\nService is good.

It is important to get the marinated spice into the meat. The other things is the chicken need to grilled a bit more to crispy the skin.  It is the crispy and tasty skin that make the name of the Boston Market. One thing they done very well is the maintenance of juicy meat. This may be due to their good technique. \n\nI have the three pieces dark meat which is good enough for a meal. It come with two sides of your choice.

I expect it to be high quality. Some how it has not meet the standard may be we are the early crow at 5 pm. Second, the soup is part of the all you can eat but the machine is broken, the soup is regular room temperature. I think this should be be prepared and ready all time. Third. Many time the waitress forget to bring our order. And the table was not check regularly and the 18% tip is added due to we have large crowds. \n\nWith that said. We enjoy our time there. Since we we have a large table. We were able to divide our group to different categories grilled or order. It was fun to grill with a group. It is not good for two people to be here. I would said need 3 or more person in order to enjoy it. More is the best. \n\nOne best thing is they have good ventilation in the restaurant. It is a plus.
