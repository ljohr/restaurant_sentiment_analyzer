Only one of our members get the food late. The close out may need to work on it. Tip was added since we have large group which may my bill easy. \n\nI have order the lamb kebab (Shish Kebab) plate. It come with two choices of side. I got the rice and the babaghanoush. The rice was well cook and nice aroma. The babaghanoush was well prepared and great with extra olive oil. The presentation of the dish is pleasant. However, the meat did not measured up. It was too dry and the marinated is not over the top. They need to improve on this area. \n\nI have been here several time. My previous experience is better. During the month of Ramadan, they serve the buffet that are plenty of choices and attractive. I would said try them during this time. The buffet of Ramadan usually start at 8:30. Go early because is a lot of customers.",

A lot eye candy in the restaurant with my wife. Strange.  \n\nMy wife was at the restaurant first and she order ahead. I follow to the restaurant in 10 minutes. She order the lunch special with Chinese stir fry. Chinese food in winghouse? May be not. Her food came out like frozen section ready to cook meal from the Publix. I would not go for their Monday special. \n\nThey have two selection of fish sandwich in the menu. Grouper cousin or Mahi Mahi. Grouper cousin is one type of white fish. I definitely go for the real name fish- the Mahi Mahi. It can be grilled, blackened or deep fried. I have it grilled. The blacken Mahi Mahi is not the spicy type I like but it do have a good taste. This sandwich is better than their daily special. \n\nThe service is average. However, I think they need to be faster for lunch. Most people only have one hour.",

I like their decorations. \n\nWe were sit immediately on second small room. Including us is about three tables of customers. We have ordered Black pepper basil crispy duck and Spicy noodle with squid. Food delivery is on time. The black pepper basil squid is average. The spicy noodle seem like not cook in high heat because I cannot taste the burn oil. Both dish is actually made for American Thai flavor. The local may like it but I am looking for good Thai which is average. \n\nThe service is not measured up. We were not able to get attention of our waitress. But the other two tables was able grab her attention. Some how we got ignored. The three stars for the food and the service we have experience.",

Today I have the shave prime rib basket with upgrade to onion ring ($1 more) and my wife have the Atlantic cod basket with upgrade to shake ($2 more).\n\nThey give you a number and the food was brought to the table. This is plus that you don,t need to wait for your order at the counter. The food came in 5 minutes. \n\nThe shave prime rib is a bit salty. The onion ring and the cod came with a thick fried beard coating at the cover. To do the coating for deep fried have two method. The wet flour with material then fried or dry flour with material then fried. This restaurant chose the wet coating. As a result there is oil in the coating if you don't sit the food for a while and serve. \n\nThe service is good. However, I am not a fan for the wet coating. I believe the restaurant can improve on this front.  I not against the fry food but against the oily food due oil residue can be tasted at the onion ring coating.",

Tandoori chicken is also good there. They have served different biryanis. But I like the noodle. One thing special I can said is the shrimp curry. It is interesting. \n\nOverall the price is at the high side. I do not get the wow factor. But I can tell you they don't make it less spicy because of Americans.

We start with the Musubi - saut\u00e9ed spam in seaweed and rice. Very interesting. The second dish is the special of the day with salmon poke and thin piece rice cake. This is interesting dish too. We have the stack - slow cook pork on sushi rice top with claw slaw. The rice is not my liking. The pork are sweet. The final dish Mauna Kea Keck II - slow cook beef on the spinach with twin scoop of rice. The beef is average. The rice definite needs improvement. \n\nOverall the service is very good. The dishes presentation are well design. However the food seasoning and taste is not there. I like the live music and dollar champagne for good New Year celebration.",

The food is not cheap for lunch and dinner after we look at the menu. As long they can provide a good food. We are good. \n\nWe order the chicken panini and the Margherita Classic. The panini is good. Chicken was grilled. Accompanied fries was crispy. The Margherita is a flatbread top with chop steak with mozzarella cheese. It very good. Overall the food is good. The wait is a bit longer for the food. \n\nThe reason is three stars is due to waiter didn't pay attention to the table. Even we try to flag him down. Lunch during office hour usually is short. They need to paid attention we try to paid and get put. It take us ten minutes to finally get his attention.",

Flavor and taste still need big improvement. \n\nI have the blacken octopus and seared tuna. The octopus is one tentacles. Which is small for the price they charging. The sauce can be more complicate by not stay on one sauce. May be grilled a bit better. The seared tuna coating can be improved. Not impressive. It is almost like Japanese tuna sashimi.

This taco come with skirt steak, Cotija cheese, and pickle. We don't know the Cotija cheese is. Very similar to goat cheese. This kind of cheese either you love it or hate it for the taste. I think this is a wrong move for the restaurant. Because you may have 50% of people don't like it. Steak is a bit over cook. \n\nOur second dish is the Chimichurri Steak Frites. This dish is a lot better. We order the medium rare. A few thing can improve on is the temperature serving below warm. The dish is serve over wood cutting board is not my standard. I know they try to create the impression. But for me I don't like to eat with cutting board already being cut through with a lot of cut mark below. Even though the board is clean but never guaranteed if the cut mark is fully clean. I prefer it to serve of the plate. \n\nWith that price charge for the dish, we will have high expectations.

This year we did not do the sit down lunch due to pandemic. We know the restaurant probably pack. As a result we order to go. \n\nThey have make adjustments for the pandemic for how to pick out the the food. They informed you that there is a tent outside for the curb side pickup. When I arrived I went to a line for the pickup sign. Soon realized they do have two different line. One for the large meal tray pickup and the other for to go pickup. This area they need to improve. At to pickup, I ask if I should stay in the car, the told me line up at tent area will be faster. I think they really to to be effective and efficient which they did not do it. I still have wait at 15 minutes on line to pick up food where my food was ready sit on the counter. They could have changed ready pickup line and order to go line. \n\nFood is good with a lot of side for the thanksgiving meal. I like my tradition with the restaurant. They do need to improve the online order which crash that day.",

But base on my previous stay in Miami for 11 years, this dish need work. That do not measure my taste buds. The steak needs to be thinner and more flavor. Need some burn taste too.

The oyster is top with cheese. I said is just average. The clam is better. The clam bacon, pepper and onion. This dish worth the try and drive from far distance. I notice their happy hour items included fillet mignon kabab and other interesting app. You also can go full meal for $15 with crab cake, fillet mignon kabab, coconut shrimp and more. Good deal. \n\nSunday they have brunch for $20 including two drink. Not bad. The place is nice with bar. Seating area has it own TV. Nice treatment.",

The roast pig is good here. The skin is crispy if you for a piece to try. It must roasted in the long hours. The marinated sauce when inside the meat. Consider this is a must try dish if you visit. They may be the only one who serve the pig stomach soup I found in Latin cuisine. It is good and soft. The Chinese cook it with whole black pepper, the Latin cook it yellow base soup. It take some skill to cook this dish. \n\nThe reason they are three star is the rest of the item do not stand out. The rice is under cook. The plantain is not soft enough which mean the did not do a correct selection of how ripe it need to be. The octopus Ceviche is blend. Need more spice. Service is average since is cafeteria style.",

Not many cars. \n\nWe are thinking about the dip top ice cream that was posted in the Yelp site. My wife has the Dip Top and I try the snow cone. The snow cone has the choice of Orange, Blue Raspberry, Grape and Cherry. I have them infuse all four flavors. The taste flavor is good but the shave ice is not to the standard. This store shave ice is big pieces compare to many snow cone venders. The correct way of the shave ice is tiny pieces like puffy cotton. I believe they can adjust many revolutions with slightly press to create that. Unfortunately, the store tries to save energy, and make the shave ice not delight to eat. With that, they should have 2 stars.\n\nHowever, the Dip Top did the best job among the menu and save the day. The soft serve with the Cherry dip top is handsome looking and delicious to eat. I think they are the best in town. If I come back, I will have the dip top only. The soft serve can be vanilla, chocolate or swirl of two flavor. The dip top can be chocolate, cherry or butterscotch. I bite the dip top of my wife and they are excellent.",

I like the open view with seating and view for the bay water. Some how they have least to offer. It just look cheap with current look. I like the bathroom and security everywhere. \n\nIt is great for family with open space but we miss the courtyard. It is try to be hip but not totally hip. Something is missing. Food selection like street food and we have a few spot in Bay Area which compete off. Not sure change for good but definitely not better. May be great for new year eve fireworks. But just one day out of 365 days.",

They have the corner lot which is perfect for the customers to hang out and enjoy the ice cream at outdoor side lawn. They do have seat in the store and front of the store if you decide to stay at eat. \n\nToday they have the new flavors with frosty candy cane for the holiday season. I also heard the friend of my like their guava pastelito so we try one of that. I also go with the crowd favorite the chronic popcorn. Because of pandemic, they don't have the taste try. So I order three scoop. Not cheap for the scoops. But each scoop is big. I ask if they can separate it. They said we have to get all three in tiny bowl. If not I have to paid three individual scoop cost. I would said the three scoops mash together is not good. Flavor mixed up. With no taste try, I can tell you 2 out out of three are not my favorite. I would throw away the other two. The best is still the crowd favorite the chronic popcorn. \n\nWith above reason, the about 2.5 stars. Next give a bigger bowl when I ask for it to separate the scoop. The request is reasonable but they did not provide it.",

I got the jalape\u00f1o cheese bagel with egg, bacon and cheese. The food come out warm. I was thinking if I am eat here, I would at least get temperature hot sandwich. Not so. \n\nI like their ice coffee. I got the vanilla sweet cream cold brew. The size compared with the price to paid  is at the high size. Good coffee. \n\nOverall experience is a par. Can be better if you dine in.",

Basically the amount is good mother and a child or two older person. For young adult is plenty. You will not go hungry after visit. \n\nThe downside of the restaurant is every thing take too long. It take more 10 minutes after they drop the menu and come to take your order. Often they forget to bring what you need for additional things. The service did take a back seat in this restaurant. It is not they don't have enough help, it just the mentally slow in this restaurant. \n\nI got the saut\u00e9ed palomilla with Mofongo. The first taste is great when dig the outside of mofongo. After you get to the outer layer, it lost the best taste. The palomilla I prefer it to be grilled instead of saut\u00e9ed. However, they don't have this option.",

I got the half chicken and extra two bone of BBQ rib. This come to $15 with tax. Not cheap. The chicken I think is to dry and a bit of sit on the grilled for too long. Not juicy at all. But the rib was good enough to have. Our meat come with cob of corn and BBQ baked beans. I like the baked bean because it has southern sweetness. I would only recommend only the rib for this place. \n\nAfter order take 10 minutes wait.",

This all you can eat concept is a copy from the other Japanese restaurant in New Tampa. They will be judged and compared to the similar restaurant. \n\nTonight we are trying this restaurant because they are recently open and new in the Bay Area. We have dinner buffet and they limited each person to 8 pieces of the sashimi if you have dinner buffet. The Sunday dinner buffet is $17.99 not $15.99 per the web site. Tonight we have order the following:\nSpicy Tuna Roll - 2 Stars\nSpicy Salmon Roll - 2 Stars\nShrimp Tempura Roll - 3 Stars\nRainbow Roll - 3 stars\nCrazy Roll - 3 stars\nLady In Red Roll - 3 stars\nSaki Roll - 4 Stars\nThe Coconut shrimp should not be calling in that name. Most recognize coconut shrimp is fried with coconut flake. This is just the wet flour coating fried with sweet mayo. It is different than my friend Rachel M. posted picture. I wonder they start changing their quality. The Hibachi squid is not near to the standard with most hot plate includes the minor burn of the squid. The sashimi is better since they are base on the cut. The best of the sashimi is the surf clam. This is the most value of the dish. The hibachi tofu is perfect for taste and texture. The fried scallop is not the true scallop - disappointed. Age tofu is OK. \n\nThis section is to evaluate the chef skill and material. The spicy tuna is process with food processor. As a result, they are lumpy. The correct way is to chop in pieces and mix with correct spice and quail egg. By chopping it create the texture of the tuna and preserve the quality. The food processor just a short cut. Same as the spicy salmon is process that way. After I eat the sushi, I can smell the fish smell around my lip, although they are fresh but they are not the best quality due to the smell. They should not call out coconut shrimp or scallop to give customer a misconception where they are not prepare in those ingredient. \n\nThis restaurant will require a lot of improvement not just the chef skill. They also need to improve the flavor of each roll to show it is not too plain. I am thinking this restaurant is 2.5 star bases on the comment above but I am given three stars. I hope they can have dramatic improvement for the next time I am visit.",

This is spicy sexy roll with spicy tuna and tempura shrimp with spice mayo. No sure the name matches the roll. We usually come at lunch because is all you can eat with lesser price compare to dinner price. \n\nThe reason I give 3 stars due to current quality of the restaurant drop. Food is still good but they are not as good at the first year they open the restaurant. The service is still good. The hibachi chef is base on your luck. Sometime you get a good chef.",

The soup of chilled gazpacho is taste better than lunch entree. I also ask a dish to go for the coworker that cannot make it. The order is done in 5 minutes. This mean this is cafe style precook items and assemble on site immediately. The temperature of the food is warm and further evident precook item.

He just sit at register for taking order but still slow. The kitchen crew are more alert. They got your order and fried the chicken immediately. \n\nThe Nashville style chicken is using wet batter coating systems. Most of the fried chicken place use dry powder battering then fried immediately. This place have coating mixed with spice and wet it with water. The chicken then dip into the wet coating and fried. This system is more challenging. The Chinese fried chicken is like this system. Why they are 3.5 stars is because the coating getting compact and concentrated. Which mean the oil is old and repetitive fried. The fresh oil or change the oil so often will make the chicken better coating. \n\nOne best thing is the seasoning and the Nashville hot is very well receptive. This is not like Asian hot that numb you mouth and could not taste the food. The hot is acceptable by many Americans. You still can taste the hot heat and the food in the right amount of chili. This I would give them an \"A\". Price is about most fried chicken place. But I do like their fried and the pickle. It was good.",

They are not too far from Highway I-275, as a result I stop here for lunch. \n\nI got the traditional dish. I got the Bandeja Paisa. It typical Columbian dish with samples of all cooking. The dish includes grilled steak, sausage, chicharron (fried pork belly with skin), sunny side up egg, arepa, rice and bean, avocado, and sweet plantain. This is to show case the entire cuisine. \n\nWhy three stars. The steak not even close to warm. The sausage is powdery. The egg yolk over cook. It is not liquidity. The best of the dish is the chicharron.  It is crispy and good. \n\nThe service is great. It is not bad at all for the price of the dish $13.50. The service is good. If the cooking can improve, they can be easily 4 stars.",

The third dish is a cook up dish of grill steak with onion. I can hear they pound the steak at the kitchen. I like my steak grilled with no sauce.

This dish has steak, chicharon, blood sausage, regular sausage, rice, egg, plantains, bean soup. A lot to offer. The chicharron is a little tough to bite de to the skin is or crispy. Like rubber. This can improve by changing the frying oil and keep it crispy. The rest item is a little above average. My wife love her dish. She has Filete de Pescado al Ajillo. The Ajillo sauce is great. I would highly recommend this dish. It is one of the kind. \n\nThe reason they are 3 star is the wait for the food is too long. We waited almost 40 minutes. No wonder the restaurant always pack because everyone is waiting for their food. The chicharron is a typical dish which they must master before anything else. I hope my next visit they can improve on that. They have bakery section. To me is just ok. Bit my wife like it.",

If you want to sit at normal level, you may want to choose the outside patio seating. Obviously they try to imitate the beer hall type atmosphere with high top seats but it will be challenging for lady with dress. \n\nThis restaurant is open about a month. They still did not get the kink out. The food wait is about 35 minutes. Waiting staff afraid to approach you since you are waiting for the food. We got the habanero wings and the short rib. The wing is actually Buffalo wing with honey ranch type dipping sauce. I am not impressed due to 8 wings for $11 and is just regular buffalo wing. I expect more for the price paid $1.5 a wing with tax. The name not measure up. \n\nThe short rib is a fan. I like it when they braised it or slow temperature long hour grilled. The out side was crispy and nice. This short rib top with sweet mushrooms sauce with cabbage and place over pancakes. This is a great dish. \n\nOverall the service need to improve, the food waiting time need to cut down, may be grilled the wing with honey after the buffalo sauce was applied will make this wing worth $1.5 a piece.

I have it to go. \n\nI order a palabok fiesta with one non spicy chicken joy. The palabok is rice clear noodle with shrimp, ground pork and egg. It is just an ok dish. The fried chicken joy is better. I also has the spaghetti with two spicy chicken joy. The spicy of the seasoning is actually skin deep. Spaghetti is average. The best among all is peach mango pie. This is their best dish. I would recommend this. \n\nThe order was prepared fast. I really don't like the packaging. It is paper box that is not secure. Especially the food is more heavy than the box can bear. This will be their set back and easy to spill when they not secure properly in the plastic bag with two three order.",

Although they are not cheap but is about a dollar to 2 dollars lower different in the Bay Area. \n\nWe have three dishes tonight. We start with Galbi the Korean grilled short rib. The dish is $23 with about 11 pieces of short rib. It was great marinated sauce to the bone. The second dish is the Eemyoonsoo the fried Atlanta Mackerel with lightly salted. This is a whole fish. The size is medium for $17. The edge and top was fried to crispy and crunch. A very good dish to go with beer or rice wine. The last dish is Dolsot Bibimbob. The rice serve in stone bowl. That make the rice burn to crispy at the stone touch edge. This dis has egg, veggies, beef. But I think it is less flavor. They need to work on this dish. \n\nThey are better than most Korean restaurants in Tampa. You still need to wait for the food for a while but the wait time is shorter than the Korean restaurants in Tampa. I still say they need to work on the speed to deliver the food to table. Don't let the customers wait too long. Service is typically as bad as most Korean restaurants.",

Because they are systematically layout, they are not flexible to change for their meat selection. For instance if I want just capicola ham only, I will not be able to buy that. I have to select the entire Italian cut including pepperoni, salami. The reason they give is each portion is precut and assembled. You will not be able to twist and change. If I want extra meat, you have to paid entire assembly. \n\nThe sandwich is good taste for Italian, the balsamic sauce is great. But I feel sandwich assembly is thin not wide enough.

I can see the problem of this restaurant is the response time to the customer. We sit down for 10 minutes before anyone come to ask what I need. In fact, there was no one out at the front for good 10 minutes. We help ourself for the menu. \n\nWe got our orders immediately once we have someone come to our table. The food came out very quick. We order the Binagoongang Baboy - pork with shrimp paste. It you are not use to shrimp paste do not try this dish. I like this dish since the pork are well braise and soft. If they cook this dish with hot chili, it will be much better. \n\nOur second dish is the most popular dish of the restaurant. It is Da-Long-Tocilog combo. It is a breakfast dish that serve all day. It has fried pickle fish, cure pork meat, pork sausage serve with garlic fried rice and fried egg. This is a very good dish. \n\nThe food is 4 stars, but the service and attentive of the store front is 2.5 stars. So 3 stars for the restaurant. Do I come back.

I like old thick crust pizza, I am not a fan of tin crust. If you have to pig out, please go all out with no reservation. At that point you have blown the calories count any how. \n\nTonight they have the $5 two topping deal large pizza. It is enough for me and my wife. We have order the pepperoni and bacon. I call in 10 minutes before my pickup and they are ready on time. The two topping deal only on the carry out. Please make a trip to nearby pizza place. The total come to $6. Great value. \n\nThey lay the pepperoni then the bacon on top. The pepperoni is great and crispy. With bacon on top the juice of bacon further cook the pepperoni to give extra crispy. The bacon is great in this sense. Everything go well with bacon. \n\nPlease catch the deal while they last.",

There are not much good mom and pop restaurant in the area to compete. They are really located at good spot for business. \n\nWe got the Churrasco and Bistec Empanado. The churrasco is the skirt steak. Their skirt steak cut like a strip with about 1\" diameter and 7\" long. I prefer to thin and at Falda cut which they don't carry. The marinated sauce is good. The steak is cook to medium not like my order medium rare. Overall is a good dish. The Bistec Empanado is breaded thin steak. The breaded coating has no taste. I have been many Latin restaurant have better coating than them. \n\nOne other thing. We walk into the restaurant and there was no line on Tuesday night. The hostess still saying we have to wait for ten minutes for table. I see there is open table. At the end we choose the bar instead of waiting. Service is not attentive. Many area of the restaurant need to improve. Service, hostess, food.",

I walk around and found empty tables but they are not occupied by anyone. I went to check when is our turn, they lead me to the same empty table that I found 5 minutes ago. The seat is just below the AC vent. I can feel the drip of the water. They definitely need to check this vent on their off hour. Make sure water molecules is contained. \n\nThe only thing I like about this place is the service on the table and the food. Which is the most important. My wife has the Thai Coconut-Lime Chicken. It a bit lime heavy at the end. The best is the Hibachi Steak. It is the hunger steak with shiitake mushrooms in slice, caramel onion and sprout. It also included the wasabi mash potatoes and tempura asparagus. This steak is cook with the ginger sauce which is a good match. \n\nService is good over the dining time. Food come out the right time compare to my last visit. I would said the hostess need to paid attention to the empty table. Customers is less patient when exceed to the wait acknowledge time. The AC vent need to be clean and make not dripping water. Who know what dust has the water has collected.",

The grilled tuna is excellent with taste. The chocolate cake that day is not moist but it has the softness and good mix of cake. \n\nOverall, they are average. They do have a lot help on kitchen.

Many of the added on is part of the deal with no additional cost. Some other place even mix the sauce, protein and ingredients before putting in the bowl.

Many young people love this because affordable food with booze. \n\nThere are few things that the restaurant is just an average. Number one is wait for table. Number two is wait for the food. Number three is very tire server. Number four is in experience hostess. All this actually give them 2.5 stars. Wait for table is 45 minutes, wait for the food after order is 25 minutes, waitress is beat up and tired. Not sure how many table they have to take care. Hostess tell you 30 to 45 minutes wait is definitely 45 minutes. They need to clean up the table sooner and allow to clear the queue wait line. Since you have to wait for the food, it make wait line longer. \n\nOne thing they can improve dramatically is make sure each order come out quickly which will reduce the wait. It definitely effects the tip because of the wait and cause the waitress look tired and not happy. Kitchen crew definitely need to come out the food more efficient. Mexican food should be easy assembly and able to deliver quickly.",

I would said this is a neighborhood restaurant. \n\nWe got two combo of three items for $16 each. The price is fair for dinner. My plate is the sausage, rib, and the brisket. My two side is the baked bean and parsley potatoes. The meat is just average. The rib is the best. I like side parley potatoes. Other plates is with rib, chop pork and chicken. All item is just average. The meat is more to original taste. They encourage you to use the BBQ sauce with the meat. \n\nServices are good. We were able to finish at 40 minutes. The lunch special is worth for a visit. If you like BBQ. This is good option.",

I always seen a lot of them employees but did not see they actually care or clean the store. \n\nThe shaken tea with pineapple black tea is refreshing. It is better and cheaper than their coffee.

So I have two appetizers small dishes. I have the pork belly and the fried quail. Before the dish come out, there was a complimentary dish with crab meat with sauce at bottom. This is truly a good dish. The seared pork bell came out fist. Since this is first course, I think it should be quickly. But it take some time. Fortunately we already have food at elsewhere. The dish came out and the chef is clever to separate the skin from the pork belly. The skin is deep fried and the remaining is seared. It taste like Chinese crispy pork. Not impress. The bean olive oil pur\u00e9e is good. \n\nThe second dish is fried quail. This dish is disappointed. The quail is deep fried. But the batter is tasteless.

The time to wait is too long. \n\nOur fellow elite yelp member is overrated this restaurant. The price range is expensive but the food is  mediocre.

It come with drink, two side and the price close to $12. You also can enjoy the soft serve for free. We got the burn end brisket and pull Pork. It was very good the day we have visited them. They were going to throw away the side fat and o ask them just put in my plate. \n\nThe BBQ franchise was established since 1941. This restaurant is young at Wesley Chapel. This was our third visit and it still good. I think they need to increase number employees since this area is just lack off.",

Our food come out right time without too much of waiting. The food are presentable. All this are good. \n\nTwo minutes into the food we immediately find the noodle is not right. Some of the noodle are glued together. Seem like 5 Strings becomes one string. My wife noodle is very gooey. This is not acceptable. I think my noodle was sit for a while and my wife noodle was not processed correctly. In Asia, the noodle need to be broil and put in the cold water to cool off and the same time wash away the extra flour that attached to avoid gooey. This is the basic. I think their chef has not pay attention to our bowl and skip step. That cause the entire noodle are not good at all. If this happens in Asia, they will not be acceptable. \n\nI think with each bowl we paid $16 a piece. It is not to any standard and not to the art of ramen. Not worth the money. Inconsistency does cause this restaurant to be changed my opinion of number one ramen in the Bay Area to I am not sure to revisit again. I have drove 38 mile just because I have the best experience on the first encounter. Now, I am not sure their future.",

For taking so long to wait for the food I thought they must be cook the food when you check in. It was not. It is warm food and seem like seating at the kitchen. Obviously the my early put in order was cook on time but the communication from check in to food delivery to car was not coordinated. I also see an customer who missing a sauce and they take about 10 minutes to get the missing sauce to him. The execution is a F. \n\nWith that said. Their grade could be D.

When you decided for the protein, they determined two or three scoop. The difference is $2. However the scoop they are using is extremely small than the ice cream scoop. In addition, they scoop up the fish and press against the wall. So you got half of the scoop. Not like scoop up the meat and let it fall scoop. \n\nThe add on is not impressive. Just like typical poke place. They premixed some of the protein like marinated tuna, spicy salmon, and spicy tuna. Ok enough selection.

As a result, my wife select the four course with Shrimp Alfredo entree $17.50. I have the rosemary garlic chicken that is not in the four course meal. The four course meal came with chicken meatball with tomato sauce. It is good. My meal came with a soup Zuppa Toscana.  I love this soup with fresh kale, Italian sausage and  slice potato. It is good when you dip your garlic bread and let it sit for a few second and allows the soup sock into the bread. Then you eat the socking bread. Yum. The rosemary garlic chicken is ok for it price. No wow factor. \n\nToday I am disappointed on the service. They are slow. It almost want me to give them two stars. Base on the past experience, I give them 3 stars.

We normally don't do shabu shabu is due to the assembly material can be obtained in any oriental market and cook it yourself. \n\nWhat is shabu shabu. My family celebrating Chinese New Year with this cuisine because it can add anyone anytime by add additional material without involving heavy cooking. The New Year also fall in the winter time and they are cold outside and shabu shabu is the best part. There is a Chinese term for shabu shabu- hot pot. We actually have the charcoal in middle to broil the soup and heat up the pot. Now we have the electric broiler that not required charcoal and easy to control the temperature of the pot. \n\nThe material is easy. Just but the chicken and pork and remove the meat. The bone of the pork and chicken put into the soup and broil for the broth. This restaurant did not do that. All their soup is come in package of spice and added into the pot. They have the selection of the slice meat, meat or fish ball, dumpling, veggies, type noodles. They are not authentic since their soup is in package. \n\nEating the hot pot is topic the sauce correctly. The right sauce is important to dip on after you have broil your material. The service of the restaurant is slow. But they have each pot for each person. Something I don't understand is why they charge the soup to broil in addition to the material. I would suggest only charge when you want to upgrade the soup.",

They do have some specialty pizza that you normally not seen at pizza fast food restaurant. I would said they are better than the pizza fast food. All pizzas were made and display. You pick the one you like and ask them to heat up. Heat up is good, I prefer the freshly cook since I am in the restaurant. \n\nThe place is popular, outside seating is available. It is fist come first seat situation. Just wait for someone the get off is easy since most people grab only a quick bite. Seat is available very soon. The problem is wait to get your table you have claim to clean up. Eventually it will be clean.",

The regular taco is $2.50. Is kind of above the average price. \n\nI got the chorizo and the pastor. I feel their meat is chop to fine. It feel like very powdery. However, I do like their toppings. They will ask you want a Mexican way or US way. I got the Mexican way. It top with cheese and sour cream. \n\nTuesday, they have taco Tuesday for a dollar a piece. By then, it may be worth the price. Others than taco, they have quesadillas and burritos. May be that is better.",

But I think they can do better. \n\nOur service is good. Just some time they waitress not paid the highest attention to our table during meal. But when get paid, it was quick.",

    "text": "If you come drink is good. If you come for food, this may not a good choice. World of beer surprise me that they serve food. However, the food come out of the kitchen is too slow. Menu do not have good choices. \n\nI got one of the special mojito. But I feel the cocktail is too light on the alcohol percentage. The drink feel like soft drink. Unless you go with their draft beer or bottle beer. Other than that, I not recommend their cocktails. \n\nWe order three tacos for snacks, it take 30 minutes to come out. I think this area need big improvement. The shrimp taco save them one stars. If not it is 2.5 stars.",

    "text": "This Kung Fu tea is in the middle of the pack. We got the coffee slush with boba and the winter melon milk tea. I agree with Vivian that they need to improve the mixologist of the tea. Somehow it do not have the taste of harmony. The ingredients is good. The honey boba is still very good. But the the tea bitterness need to tone down. Caffeine is well maintained but the the tea bitterness somehow need to reduce. Milk is a bit heavy compare to many milk tea I have tasted. \n\nThis restaurant has token ramen section. We did not try their food this time. But will plan next visit to try their hot food. I like the open kitchen with glass wall allow the customers see their food preparation. It has increased the interest of the food.",
