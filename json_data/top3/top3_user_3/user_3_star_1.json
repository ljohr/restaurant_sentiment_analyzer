    "text": "Many can go wrong with technology that sum the restaurant problem. \n\nLike - I like restaurant has opening look. Good wall art. Nice party look of the bar area. Seem like everyone have a good time. \n\nBad - Service less restaurant. The order is made at the counter. An electronic buzzer is issued to let you know your food is ready. Then you pick up the food your self. Yes it save a lot of money to hire service people. Is you food cheaper? No. \n\nI have order to go and issue a buzzer. When I pick up the food, there is brown bag of your food is ready. I ask is this buzzer 18. The service people in the kitchen said yes. I took it home and they are not my order. Do I drive back round trip 18 miles for exchange. Probably not. I eat what is in the bag. And it is bean with ground beef burrito. The bean and ground beef below average. It is bad that I not even want to post the picture of the food. With food order wrong, now they have two not happy customers. Customer that have the wrong order and customer did not have the food. \n\nBelow can be improved. Put some service waitress. 1. Do not have the customers to pick up the food themselves at the counter. I cannot tell how many other customers has touch my food. This is not professional. Please hand the right order to the right person. 2. Put identification on the brown bag since each order look alike. Identify the right order staple with order ticket. 3. Train the kitchen people with proper order is make.  \n\nToo confusing. Burrito is below average",

    "text": "I was going to try their wing after workout. I came in the restaurant with my sweat shirt and sock with sandals. I was greeted by one of the employees and he will be get back with me. I saw the menu and decided a to go order. A few minutes later one waiter pass me by and said some one will help me. There were three waiter  and waitress pass by me and none of them can help on the take out order. I was there for 8 minutes seem like my money is not good to order. I really hungry and want to go home. Seem like they are not willing to take order I am not willing too. So turn around walk out the door without order. This will be my third one star review out of my over 800 reviews. If you charge your customers $1.50 per wing, the service should be measure up. I end up at wing express with $0.80 a wing and I am happy with it and walk out with the wings I want at 8 minutes.",

    "text": "The wait for the shuttle getting longer since I have use them for past 8 years. One thing that they have been doing is taking the nearby hotel passenger from airport and prolong the the drop off time to the parking lot since they have drop them off first. I am disappointed with their current business model.\n\nI have make a comment to their employee. And they not willing to admit the customer is right for the delay pick up and drop off. They are getting the shouting match with you. Their attitude from my last parking has turn me away. I am recommending other parking area.\n\nIf the pickup include the nearby hotel guest fill up the van, you have to wait for second van. Longer the wait time where they did not tell you.",

    "text": "It has been a while I actually give 1 star on the review. This is my first time here and we don't have good impression but bad experience. \n\nWe have coupon that allow us to buy one master Peanutty Swirl and get one free. We like to experience the 1960 roller skate window serving like the movie. The experience turn out not worthy for the food.\n\nWe arrive at Sonic and park on the station of order. The button has been push to call for order but no one has response. I have my engine on and they only have one car on drive thought and one car on station. I can see a lot of the sonic people in the building but none has come out to take order. We turn off the engine and waited for a while. Florida summer is hot even with the window down. We decided use the drive through. The drive through is responded faster than the station parking. We put our order with buy one gets one free. The total come to $8.98 and the discount is $3.59. We told them the incorrect total and ask why the discount is not half. The coupon clearly state BOGO buy one get one free but they only give you 40% discount. The swirl was given to us but spoon was not given to us while we were disagreed with the final total. \n\nManager came out and said this is the price. I told my wife it is not worth to argue since the gas spend on waiting for the price correction is already paid for it. Spoon was finally given to us and we drove away. \n\nIf you look at the food they are like ordinary fast food. Mc Donald has enclosed AC space and why I have to wait in hot weather and eat in my car or spent the gas money to be cool and eat in the car. Doesn't make sense. The concept may be work on 60's but not with AC generation. \n\nOverall coupon is not fully honor, not an AC dining, server stay in building cool themselves and ask the customer to wait, food is not the best or healthy in fast food, bad attitude server, wrong accounting, poor management. I am sadly given the one star.",

    "text": "Super 8 motel now carry the name of Wyndham chain. I would recommend to avoid this hotel. I have not many one star review. This hotel definitely deserves one. \n\n1. The hotel has long over due renovation. The item they have is old. Furniture is old, carpet is old, edging and corner of the room has many hole. \n\n2. The room floor and hallway are not clean. You see diet everywhere. I wonder how this house keeping do their job. \n\n3. Bug can be found in the room. One of the bug crawl to the iPad we are reading and suddenly appear in front of the screen. My leg has bed bug bite. \n\n4. The ice machine is old. Not sure it clean probably. \n\n5. The room do not carry a hair dryer. Even call at the front desk and they simply said they don't provide it. This is the most serious of all. If you have lady partner travel with you in the winter time. The hair is not dry with catch serious cold next day. \n\n6. Breakfast is very lack off and very little. Not sure how the run the hotel. \n\nWith that said. I would said extremely highly not recommend this hotel. The owner need to seriously consider how the manage and maintain this hotel.",
