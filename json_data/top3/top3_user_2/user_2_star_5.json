To kick it up a notch I stuffed in Jalapeno Chips for a spicy crunch. \nIt was great on an afternoon when autumn is starting to assert itself with bluster.  \n\nThis excellent local establishment continues to turn out first rate creative dishes thanks to the ever-present Micha, and her friendly staff.  It has become my most constant breakfast companion, and often my lunch date, as well.  \n\nIf you have not been in for a taste of home cooking with a Korean flare, you don't know what you are missing. \n\nFind a way to get there.  Sit down and become part of the family.",

    "text": "My office neighbor and I went to lunch at La Vecchia Osteria this afternoon, after postponing our plans a few times due to busy schedules.  So glad we finally made it!\n\nWe were greeted warmly by the owner, Pasquale, and served by his beautiful daughter. The side room was bright with the winter sun streaming in the windows and making the golden amber room glow.  The corner table offered a little privacy, but it was not crowded today.  Small Antipasto with a mix of prosciutto, salami, hard cheeses, buffalo mozz.,  black and green olives to begin.  Fresh, crusty bread with olio and herb dip.  Grilled\nBranzino filleted after cooking, and just before bringing to the table.  Pure white tender with light extra virgin and lemon.  Perfect!  My friend had Chicken\nBreast in olive oil and capers, with a side of Vodka Rigatoni.  We stopped our chat while we savored our repast.  \n\nConversation resumed with a slightly gazed countenance of satisfaction as we finished with coffee and sharing a homemade Cannoli that was so smooth, sweet, and creamy that we had to close our eyes to fully absorb the experience.  \n\nOh well, another dinnerless night.  But, it was so worth it!",

    "text": "If you are like me, and enjoy a small business success story served with whipped cream and strong coffee, the Old Croydon Caf\u00e9 is just about as good as it gets.  \n\nI stopped in for the first time this week and took a stool at the counter.  From my vantage point I could look into the kitchen service window and see the heads of the cooks making magic out of eggs and pancake mix.  The old joint is on the north end of State Road, which I soon discovered could be used as a detour from Rt. 95, all the way to Center City.  Good to know!\n\nThe place is small, with 7 or 8 stools and an equal number of booths and tables.  I sat next to a house painter, lawn mower repair man, and a roofer.  The conversation was cordial and full of gallant repartee.  The owners worked front and back and kept the dishes coming along with the warm banter.  I really liked OCC even before my French Toast Deluxe arrived.  This was as downhome as this part of Pennsylvania gets. \n\nWhen my breakfast arrived I beheld an oval plate framing a still life watercolor.  The 3 slices of well grilled and caramelized French Toast, topped with Fresh Whipped Cream and Blueberries, Strawberries, and Bananas, and finished with a lazy drizzle of Blueberry Sauce. (See Photo) The toast was hot, the cream cool, and the fruit cold and juicy.  The tastes and textures were fun and delicious.  It was one of those meals that I did not want to end.  \n\nOld Croydon Caf\u00e9 has definitely made my very short list of favorite breakfast nooks.  I will return to explore the menu, and even come back for lunch when possible.  \n\nThis place is a hidden treasure.",

    "text": "I am normally not a fan of prix-fix menus, as they tend to be too limiting of choice, and suggests a kitchen unable to handle more options.  But, when that standard menu comes in 7 courses with additional vegetarian alternatives, and is packed into a Bedouin's tent of a restaurant, complete with belly dancing, baklava and honey tea, I can make an exception.  \n\nThis is multiplied many fold when your 40 closest friends are packed into a carpet clad room with barely enough room to sit down, and an ambient noise level loud enough to make talking to anyone but those right next to you impossible. Yet, with enough wine and North African music to alter consciousness, this becomes an all-consuming environment that transports you out of South Street and into the dark, mystic souk casbah of one of the ancient cities of Morocco. \n\nMarrakesh takes finger food to the ultimate.  From cool salads, to roast chicken, cumin lamb and grilled beef, cous-cous with veggies, the only thing between your fingers and the searing meal is the thin pita used to pinch, lift and stuff in your face.  Failing that, be prepared for first degree burns.  \n\nThe large metal serving trays kept coming with more food.  We all appreciated the concession to the use of towels to cover laps and wipe hands. Some of the braver souls accompanied our graceful dancer as she gyrated her hips, abdomen, shoulders and arms with cymbals ringing. Some of our folks really knew how to move.  Impressive.\n\nStepping back out onto Leithgow Alley after 4 hours within this transporter, it took a few moments to reorient myself to being back in Philadelphia after our wild ride.\n\nMarrakesh is not just a restaurant, it is a magic carpet.",

    "text": "It was good to be back in the old neighborhood again up along Baltimore Avenue in West Philly.  Things have changed around my old home at 48th and Balto, mostly for the better.  I was here a few months ago sampling the heat at Chili Szechuan, and this time I was back to meet up with Yelp friends at Mood Caf\u00e9, the Chaat & Lassi emporium on the point at 46th Street.  Lucky for me, they were delayed arriving, and I had an opportunity for a long talk with Hasan, the owner/chef/creative genius behind the concept and the counter that is Mood.  I got the $.50 tour, and an autobiography worthy of Horatio Alger. \n\nWhile I had eaten Chaat (pronounced, \"Chart\") before, it had never been like this.  Hasan has taken what is basically a common street food in India and turned it into an adventure in eating.  It comes at you in several dimensions - taste, texture, hardness/softness, shape, spice, food group, color and surprise.  It sat before me the most colorful assortment of edibles imaginable.  I had the Salad Chaat with Chicken, but there was so much happening inside that take out container that the meat was forgotten in the exploration of what was going on with all the reds, yellows, stars, logs, crispies, noodles, dried fruit, nuts, fresh mango, greens, feta cheese, chili sauces, curry notes, etc.  It is difficult to describe all the hyperactivity in that bowl.  Imagine an Indian version of Trail Mix thrown into a salad rather than croutons. If he had tossed in some M & M's I would not have been shocked.  This baby was Buh-Buh-Buh-Bizzzeee!!!\n\nAnd, bottom line, it was awesome. We tried each others dishes, and all were unique and captivating. \n\nAnd, that does not even get into the Lassis.  More than 60 varieties of cool, creamy yogurty, sweetness.  Mine?  A Rose Lassi, complete with Rose Petals! Not just amazing, but fun!  If this wasn't enough, Hasan brought us samples of other Lassi combos in small cups to try.  This man knows how to seduce with great taste. Oh. And did I mention the Kheer and Rice Pudding he gave us at the end? \n\nOver the Top!\n\nAs good as Mood Caf\u00e9 is, it is a very small shop.  Four tables with bench seats along the wall and plastic stools for everyone else.  So, not the most comfortable arrangement.  It is geared as a take out place, with everything served in take out containers and plastic utensils.  I would be willing to pay more for comfort.  \n\nThe sheer enjoyment of the event (yes, this was more than just a cool meal) kicks the experience into 5 Star territory.  In truth, there should be another category available on Yelp that addresses the euphoria and exclamations needed for certain special foodie moments.  \n\nMood Caf\u00e9 would reach that level of extreme amazed unadulterated satisfaction. \n\nYeowee!!!",

It has the iconic architecture of those build in the 1940's and 50's, before DQ became of burger joint that sold soft serve ice cream.  \n\nThis is the place to bring the kids and grandparents on hot August nights, stand in line at the two small windows, peruse the now expansive menu, and walk away with your favorite vanilla or chocolate swirled cone, sundae, or Blizzard.  The look and taste is exactly as it was in the early days, and a wonderful trip down memory lane.  \n\nDon't worry about the sketchy neighborhood.

    "text": "If you know Trenton, and particularly the Hamilton Avenue/Trenton Central High School area, you know it has a small commercial zone with a bunch of divey restaurants, only a few of which would you think to visit. The oldies but goodies (Eddie's Donuts, Chuck's Chicken Wings, that great cheesecake place), are either long gone, or hanging on with other outlets out in the burbs. \n\nBut, along comes Halal Brothers, with its bright red, white and black logo, sparkling clean shop, friendly, accommodating ownership and outstanding Afghani menu, and all those preconceptions are thrown out the window. This place is inviting and its food is top notch delicious. I was there for lunch recently and almost fell in love.\n\nAt the counter I admitted to my first time there, and was offered a sample of their chicken and lemon chicken over rice. A minute later I was handed a small bowl of the two finished with white sauce and a touch of chili sauce. Diminutive, it was still beautifully presented and terrific. I sat down to eat it and tasted the panoply of flavors dancing on my tongue. Both the straight chicken and the lemony version were tender, moist and a mouth full of interesting exotic belly dancing.\n\nFrom there I decided on their chicken salad - the same regular chicken morsels with a load of salad (lettuce, tomato, onion, cheese, white sauce and spicy red hot sauce) in a bowl. With a bottled drink, $7. Quite a deal! And, it was as great as the sample. With check in on Yelp, a free triangle of baklava joined the party. Mine had a cream filling, rather than the better known honey nut stuffing. It was also very good, like a Bavarian Cream donut made with philo rather than cake dough. \n\nAll I can say is that such surprises deserve return visits and five star reviews.",

    "text": "Definitely one of the best burger joints in Philadelphia, especially if price plays into your taste appreciation. What used to be a food truck operation has now taken root on West Girard Avenue (2800 Block). Although, small in stature, their burgers, cheesesteaks and roast pork sandwiches are worthy of being called, \"Philly Prime.\" At less that $10 per, they offer a strong value compared to some of the expensive burger houses. \n\nMy Ponderosa Burger with grilled onions & mushrooms, Swiss, and fries inside the potato bun, topped with a drizzle of their secret steak sauce, was both a sight and delight.  Although slightly beyond my requested Medium finish, it remained juicy with a great taste profile from the added ingredients. The first bite told the tale.  It exploded in my mouth with so much forceful flavor, that some of it squirted out from my loosely closed lips. Glad I had grabbed enough napkins at the counter to deal with it. \n\nMy lovely companion sampled the Manayunk Roast Pork Sammy (pork loin topped with American, coleslaw, pickle and BBQ sauce).  She could barely finish half!  Too, their fries were copious, crisp and freshly cut. \n\nService, friendly and engaging. Order and pickup at the counter. \n\nExcellence all around.",

    "text": "When Sal DeForte's Ristorante was still in Chambersburg, Trenton, NJ., it was one of my favorite Italian haunts for a delicious and romantic dinner.  Dark woody tones, beautiful old bar, and aproned servers trained in the old ways.  It was a complete experience. \n\nTime passes, and as with almost all the casas Italiana in that great neighborhood, they moved out to the burbs to follow the migratory paths of their customers.  Sal's landed in Ewing on Pennington Road.  It took me many years before I found my way back, but I finally made it this week for a business lunch with a client. \n\nI expected it would only be a shadow of its former self, but I was wrong.  It wasn't a recreation of the Old World house, but about as good as a modern setting can be in attempting to capture the essence of the past. The atmosphere was still hushed, and the d\u00e9cor was both formal and comfortable at the same time. Cloth tablecloths, fresh flowers, large curtained windows all around, and servers in black gliding around the floor.  The menu was much as I remembered it. Fresh veal, chicken, pasta, soups and salads, served with roast potatoes and string beans. Side salad for every dish.  Lunch sized portions coming in around $8.95 per meal.  \n\nMy chicken francaise was two fillets, egged, and pan fried with a touch wine and lemon.  Excellent!  My business associate's platter was a grilled salmon, that he devoured with relish. The bread basket had a nice sliced loaf of very fresh crusty acqua y farina.  Overall, just an exemplary midday meal that completely out distanced my expectations. \n\nWould I return for another meal?  Without a doubt!  \n\nThis lunch was so good it made me forget how much I missed the old Sal's.",

    "text": "Way cool coffee house in the heart of Newtown. \n\nComfortable minimalist d\u00e9cor, with smaller and larger community tables that invite the private conversation and the long work session with excellent brew in hand.  Counter Culture beans and friendly skilled baristas/owners keeping their hands and hearts in their business. \n\nMy chai latte was excellent, served in a large dark blue ceramic cup and saucer.  My co-conspirator had a regular latte and almond biscotti, both of which he said he enjoyed. The casual atmosphere made for a good place to talk.  \n\nThey seem to be developing bakery oriented snack offerings in addition to the Italian dipping sticks.  Cookies, brownies, bagels of varying stripes were under glass up front.  Tempting, but too close to dinner to indulge.  \n\nIt is natural to compare The Coffee Room with Starbucks right down the street.  They are different in ambiance and selection of drinks and nosh.  Starbucks has more to eat and a larger drink menu on the wall, yet the coffee creations at The Corner Room seem higher quality, and certainly more tasty when comparing their respective javas straight up.  Here, there was no burnt taste so often associated with Mermaid coffee.  \n\nThere is plenty of room for both joints in Newtown.  \n\nWelcome to the hood!",

    "text": "Zaika on Grant Avenue in Northeast Philly, is one of the best Pakistani/Indian restaurants I have ever had the pleasure of supping in.  I mean, there are some strong reviews from people I respect, but I didn't think I was about the experience a gastronomic wonder. Chef Mohammed has it going on!  \n\nSomewhat surprising that we were among the very few customers on a Sunday night, but no complaints. The house was recently renovated with a larger dining room, and a touch of class with comfortable seating and sparse, but attractive d\u00e9cor.  Our server, Nema, was excellent.  She knew the questions to ask to make sure we got what we wanted.  Correct level of spiciness, and the right dipping sauces for the dishes ordered. No ice for the water. When undecided about whether to go with garlic or chili naan, she had the ready solution of having the tandoor bake up a combo of the two.  Garlic chili naan, indeed, was a winner. \n\nThe rest was a cavalcade of wonderous dishes that expanded my understanding of what was truly possible in an IndoPak kitchen.  There were only three plates requested; a Samosa Chat app, Chicken Kashmiri and Bhaingan Bharta (eggplant). Each was uniquely distinct from similar plates in other restaurants, and each was outstandingly better.  \n\nThe Chat was a deconstructed Samosa, with the crisp fried dough on the bottom of a mass of tender chickpeas, potatoes and spicy homemade Masala sauce.  It was ordered for medium heat.  Auspicious beginning!  It had a complex flavoring and texture that was similar to other samosas, but somehow better, with a subtle sweet undernote to the usual fritter-like taste.  Delightful. \n\nThe Chicken Kashmiri was ordered because of familiarity with this dish elsewhere; knowing it to be cream based and a lightly sweet alternative to all the curried heat coming from the other sources.  This version was that, but so much more.  Rather than just the combination of the heat from the cream sauce, the sweetness was supplied by raisins, pineapple and dried apricots.  A complete and unexpected surprise, that was in turn a mystery to be solved.  It took a while to figure out what those flavors/textures were.  But, when realization dawned, so did a big smile at the elegantly simple, yet creative genius at work.  Pineapple and apricot discovery was better than a game of charades. I loved this masterstroke. \n\nThe Bhaingan was not as wildly original, but an excellent mashed roast eggplant, green peas, onion, pepper and tomato mixed with traditional herbs and spices.  Ordered hot, it was a nice counterpoint to the cooler sweetness of the Kashmiri. \n\nLast, but far from least, the Garlic Chili Naan, was a knockout bread sensation.  A bit oily, but the interplay of the two main ingredients so well seared to the surface of the naan, and the chewiness and absorption of the lightly crisped dough, made for great taste and the perfect utensil to pick up the sauces from each dish and slowly devour every last drop.   \n\nYes. There was a Mango Lassi, too.  Best way to cool an overheated tongue is to bathe it in cool mangoed yogurt drink.  \n\nZaika - The best meal I have had so far this year.",

Although the Inn named for his most daring plan feels like it might have been around to provide succor to our troops, it actually came later.  Still, if patriotic memories served with drink and sustenance are your thing, the Washington Crossing Inn will make you a very satisfied customer.  The place just feels so authentic and historically grounded that it is impossible not to have at least a moment of reflection about the birth of our nation fought and died for all around on this hallowed ground.  \n\nOn a quiet Friday eve in August, when many were far away on vacation or at the shore, the WCI provides a nurturing and comfortable abode for a well made libation to accompany an equally crafted conversation.  We sat at the bar catching up on too infrequently overlapping lives, me enjoying a Padron Margarita Up No Salt.  It was tart, smooth and strong, without ice to dilute, nor salt to dry the lips.  It was so good I anticipated the second long before I was close to finishing the first.  The conversation became poignant, and my hunger asserted itself, so we agreed to move to a nearby hightop to enjoy a tavern meal as we imbibed and edged closer to the heart of our exchange.  \n\nMy Tavern Burger was very good with Red Onion, Tomato, and Lettuce ensconced in a fresh Kaiser Roll.

It was one of the better burgers I had eaten in the past year.  Together, the Rita and Burger were a perfect complement to unexpectedly meaningful evening.  \n\nFor facilitating this exceptional moment in a wonderfully ambient historic environment, I genuinely felt this was as good as it gets.

The joe was fresh and strong as expected from Philadelphia's oldest caffeine roaster (since 1854). \n\nThe frenchie was well panned, with plenty of caramelized edges for melted butter and syrup to accumulate. The egg mix tasted of vanilla and cinnamon, just as I like it. But for the Stuckey containers of corn syrup sweetener, it was a strong reintroduction to a favorite and missed morning meal. If real maple syrup had been an option, I would have jumped at the chance for a near perfect indulgence. \n\nOtherwise, a wonderful first breakfast out in the world again.",

    "text": "Riverside, NJ, is no longer the thriving Delaware River side town it was in the middle of the last century. Scott Avenue is still a wide expanse well designed for Independence and Veterans Day parades, but the storefronts on either side are now either boarded up or operating as low budget businesses working hard to survive in this dusty backwater now that its industrial base is gone. That is, except for the Golden River Restaurant. \n\nTheir building has been standing for over one hundred years, taking many forms from drug store to early age department store and appliance outlet. Since about 1992 it has been a restaurant, most recently in its present form as a breakfast/lunch emporium. I stopped in after court in Mt. Holly to see what they had going on. \n\nIt is a large room with booths and tables up front and an old lunch counter in back. It feels dated, yet comfortable - quietly fitting into the over the hill sensibility of Riverside itself. I took a stool at the counter and was immediately approached by a very friendly server offering Lacas Coffee and a menu. People were shorter a century ago, and I discovered that I could not fit my legs under the counter. I moved over to the end of the row where there was a bit more room due to warpage and a bent stool frame. Fit my 6' 4\" fine there. \n\nI ordered their Greek Omelette with rye toast, and suggested the chef put the home fries inside the egg case along with the onions, peppers, mushrooms, sausage, feta and whatever else was in there. In the meantime I sipped my joe and chatted with my counter lady and other customers. Everyone was talkative and willing to share their thoughts. Cool! \n\nMy breakfast was delicious and filling. The eggs were still wet enough to meld with its filling, allowing each element to speak in its own voice, yet harmonize perfectly together. It was definitely a case where the whole was greater than the sum of its parts. A splash of hot sauce completed the dish, adding a touch of heat to the rest of the opus. The rye had crunchy texture and sourness, exactly as I like. This was a strong candidate for omelette of the year. \n\nAs I departed the chef/owner met me at the door to ask after my satisfaction. He was pleased with my reply. Turns out that he had spent years in Trenton and knew many of the same restaurants and lawyers from the capital city where my office is located. A pleasant surprise. \n\nI congratulated him on his success in Riverside, and reminded him that his employee at the counter deserved a raise. \n\nHope she gets it.",

    "text": "It's about time to bestow the fifth star to Newtown Bagel. It is awarded for consistency of effort, sincere and friendly service, long term partnership with the community and excellence in breakfast sandwiches. Their success is shown by the opening of a second shop, Yardley Bagel Co. in Lower Makefield, which produces the same quality baked rounders as Newtown, in a more expansive and comfortable space. Can a third be far behind? \n\nWhile I still have a small issue with the texture of the bagel skin which is softer (less crisp) than I prefer, I can't deny that the pliable nature when fresh from the oven creates a perfect platform for a hot steaming sandwich. My just eaten sausage, egg & cheese on untoasted onion bagel was wonderfully delicious from first bite through last. The chew blended ingredients well and gave full voice to the harmonics exploding in my mouth. Alas, my tastes have matured to appreciate the pleasure of the different texture. There is a place in life for more than one variety of bagel. \n\nBagel Wisdom attained by hard experience and exhaustive bagel research cannot be denied.",

The crowd is quite different than who you see at breakfast and lunch.  It seems like many of Micha's friends come down to hang out with her.  They bring wine or harder stuff for all to share, and often pick up a mix of desserts to pass around.  Sort of like a pot luck. \n\nThis is a great direction for this small house.

This year the choice was the new Metro Diner in the spot where the Wells Fargo Bank used to be in the corner of Lincoln Plaza Shopping Center. \n\nThe place was a buzzing half full house, with full complement of cooks and service personnel putting the \"fast\" in Metro's fast casual dining. The Roasted Turkey Platter (3 large slices of white meat, blanched green beans, stuffing, mashed potatoes & gravy) were placed steaming hot before me five minutes after ordering. It was all very good, and the included slice of pumpkin pie with dollop of whipped cream, the perfect alternative to the DIY option. The $15 per person charge gives \"lazy\" a good name. \n\nThese guys were closing at 2 to give staff time with family.\n\nWe went on to visit friends after their dinners and celebrated all we had to be thankful for for the remainder of the day.",

I could make an argument for it, but the real point is that it is so good that people who love Italian should give it a try. Back in the day I returned to Trenton to satisfy my Napoli needs, but those days are gone, and we all must find alternatives closer to home.\n\nPasquale is the owner/chef/creative genius of Vecchia Osteria.  He takes great pride in his cuisine, and oversees the details between being on the floor checking on his customers and making everyone feel welcome.  He can be generous.  Complimentary glasses of wine and cannoli are not uncommon.  In between, the courses are excellent and each taste follows on upon the one before building into a crescendo of taste, texture, and subtle overlay.  Maestro, please continue. \n\nLast week, VO was one of several local eateries to donate dishes a for large dinner in town.  They provided Chicken Cacciatore (white version), and Rigatoni Vodka, enough for 60 people.  The Chicken was dark meat with lots of Rosemary covering everything.  The meat and bone were easily parted, leaving a succulent light wine and vinegar sauce to bathe the dark chicken flavors.  It was superb.  The pasta was the larger rigatoni, which held the creamy tomato gravy in its grooves and ridges like they were born together.  It was a subtle tone so as not to compete with the more robust cacciatore.  Great combination.  I was sure to take some leftovers home to enjoy the next day, as Chicken Cacciatore becomes even more satisfying with age. \n\nI have eaten in Pasquale's house several times, and always wondered why I waited so long to return.  \n\nIt always exceeds my expectations.",

The meet up at Tired Hands Fermentaria was my first opportunity to visit this well known brewery in Ardmore, Pa., and to sample its wares.  I've got to say that sitting at a table with about 20 peeps, surrounded by the acoustically challenged corrugated iron-roofed warehouse and close to the stainless steel fermenting tanks where the magic is done, made for a loud amplified afternoon. Yet, sitting with folks that I look forward to seeing, and the new ones that I am about to meet, made it bearable. \n\nArriving late, I was still in time to find a seat and order a Shamabalac mystical ale and a veggie Banh Mi wrap.  Our server was cool and competent, keeping everyone in suds and sustenance, while allowing us to maintain separate tabs.  Quite a trick that she handled with aplomb. \n\nThe drink was blond and had remarkable fruity notes.  Liked it, and ordered a couple more. The Vietnamese interpreted sandwich was hardly banh mi at all, given that it was in a wheat wrap rather than a French baguette.  True, the daikon, carrot, tofu and siriracha were present, but the concept was wrong.  Better to just called it Vietnamese inspired, and leave it at that. It was okay, but the image in my head was abandoned unfilled. \n\nTruth be told, I am not a beer maven, although I enjoy it in small creative doses.  Bourbon is my downfall.  Still, I see what people like about Tired Hands, and brewery clubs in general.  The capacity crowd on this late Saturday afternoon, certainly did, too.",

I did clean my hands before touching the keyboard.  \n\nKing of Falafel in the Newtown Farmers' Market is very close to the main entrance, requiring a right turn past the pretzel stand, and then it is right in front of you.  It offers all manner of Middle Eastern/Greek delicacies from Fresh Feta and Olives to Stuffed Grape Leaves and Baklava.  It is all very good.  Today, I wanted a Falafel Pita.  I quickly brought it back to my office to devour, as the dining area was crowded with the lunchers.  \n\nAs I unwrapped the aluminum foil the aroma of hot chickpeas and tachina wafted over me.  My salivaries reacted immediately, and I had to swallow hard to regain control.  The first bite penetrated the warm pita, sliced through a falafel ball, and diced the lettuce easily.  The flavor of fresh ground chickpeas dominated the oral sensations, but the tachina sauce quickly caught up with its own sesame subtleties.  The mix was fresh and insisted I pay attention.  The falafel was well fried (not over done) with little oily taste and a hint of gentle sweetness, while the tachina took it all in a different, slightly sour direction.\n\n  It was great!  It took me back to the Souk in Jerusalem where I had first tried the varieties of things that could be stuffed onto a pita and rolled up as a twenty something student at Tel Aviv University.  My reverie ended, but as I went to toss away the recyclable remains, I noticed something else in the bag.  It was a single piece of Baklava thrown in as a final sweet ending by the owners. Nice surprise!   My lips are still sticky.  The philo dough, grounds nuts, and honey were a wonderful end to an enjoyable lunch break and time travel experience.  \n\nI will make new travel reservations soon as the Newtown Farmers' Market is only open 3 days a week.  \n\nAll aboard!",

With early 20th Century elevated subway (the El) rumbling above the shadowed street below, it can be difficult to see any hope of renewal. Yet, a closer look shows seeds germinating in the cracks in the sidewalk. \n\nThe 3900 block has several Southeast Asian restaurants that are more than just surviving, but thriving in this unforgiving environment. Vietnamese, Lao, Chinese and Thai kitchens are turning out some of the best cuisine in the city. I drove down last weekend to explore some of the possibilities, and selected Vientiane Bistro as my starting point. \n\nRight next door to the well known Cafe Pho Ga Thanh Thanh, the Bistro is nicely renovated with utilitarian metal furniture, plank floors and simple wall decorations. The aroma of lemongrass, ginger and garlic greeted me at the door, quickly followed by the attractive, friendly server pointing me to a deuce in front along the side wall. She returned with menu a moment later. She was unaware that there was also a lunch list and when I inquired, she confirmed with the owner that it was available as well. She retrieved one promptly. My Yelp research paid off, giving me a chance to sample a few smaller portions of more dishes; Lao style dim sum .\n\nCoconut Soup, Veggie Spring Roll, Chicken Pad Kee Mao (Drunken Noodles) and Tamarind Wings appetizer, were soon being prepared by their talented chef. I was about to be entertained by a four act play. \n\nThe soup was mildly sweet, full of veggies and a nice place to start. Loved every slurp and picked up the bowl to drain every drop. The six Tamarind Wings were large, grilled and bathed in a dark rouge/amber thick tart glaze. After the soup, it presented a very different taste and texture. A lover of tamarind duck, this was a great counterpoint and subtle reminder of that favorite. The Spring Roll was the weak link, but with the sweet dipping sauce was more of a bridge to what came next. I asked for the Pad Kee Mao to be done \"extra spicy.\" That was what I got. Each bite of the veggies, chicken and broad noodles ignited my lips, gums and tongue with a pleasant burn, that gradually increased as I worked my way down the large mound in the wide bowl. Never numbing, I felt as much as tasted every morsel. Special surprise at the bottom of the bowl, where all the oils and spices collected and covered the last few pieces of food. I knew I probably shouldn't, but I couldn't resist spooning all of that into my mouth. \n\nHoly cow! It was a hot blast that brought tears to my eyes and blew out my sinuses. Tears of joy, I assure you. Should have asked for more napkins, but it all ended well. \n\nThe influence of Lao and Thai cuisine on each other is wonderful. The hybrid creates a flavor/texture profile that connects the delicacy of Thai sauces with the heavier heartiness of Lao cooking. That is a beautifully delicious thing and a place that I could live happily forever.",

Up here, it is still possible to buy a townhouse for south of $100 grand, and catch the train to Suburban Station from Torresdale Septa stop. You can live among folks who have roots that go back generations, and fit in as a newbie welcomed to the hood. It is possible to find your pioneer spirit in the 21st. \n\nAnd, when you explore a little, you can find places like Athenian Diner on Torresdale Avenue that has been slinging excellent hash & eggs for over 50 years at the same row house location. Walking in and taking a counter stool immediately alerts you that some things just never change. The breakfast dishes are excellent. The waitresses have been there since at least the turn of the century, and they make you feel right at home with their first smile and easy urban offhand manner. Yes. You can eat the atmosphere; it is that timeless. \n\nI sat at the end of the counter across from the Bunn-O-Matic. My white mug of joe arrived quickly, and my request for milk over creamer was met with a short glass of moo juice just for me. Greek diner required a Greek breakfast, and the Greek Omelet seemed the only way to go. Tomato, onion, green pepper, & feta mixed with two eggs and a side of home fries, presented as beautifully to the eye as it was to the tastebuds. Rye toast with a touch of butter completed the ensemble. It was delicious. I love that salty tartness of feta blended with the more subtle savoriness of the onion/tomato mix. Even the potatoes fit in nicely, although I did leave some of them behind to save on calories. Didn't need nor miss that third egg, at all. \n\nI parked on a side street to avoid the meters, and to build a walk into the experience. It was obvious that despite some economic development on this main street, that Tacony still had a long way to go before it became an upscale desirable address. In many ways, that truth made it all the more attractive.",

A dusting of sugar/cinnamon finished the   presentation. It looked great, a sensibility only surpassed by it amazing taste. \n\nFirst bite was was a five star riot. The combination of ingredients was both a textural and flavor banquet for the tongue and soul. How this was created in the tiny kitchen behind the dining room may never be fully discovered.

The cook explained that they were out of the expected strawberry and banana garnish, and that he worked with what he had. Kiwi was soft and sweet, while the blueberry, plump with exquisite pulp. It was a winner all the way around.\n\nAlthough not my usual stamping ground, this stretch of Brownsville Road has a number of very good restaurants hidden in this older part of southern Bucks. It is now even more worthwhile to return to find out what other pleasant surprises come out of Pat's kitchen.",

Housed in one of the old strip commercial buildings, it has the benefit of low rents to keep their prices very reasonable, as well as recipes handed down from parents to kids that have stood the test of time as being what people love to eat when thinking traditional Italian-American cuisine. The walls of the dining room are full of old family photos in black and white that add to the ambiance of this vintage pizza parlor.\n\nI settled into one of their three booths to await a single slice appetizer and 12\" Mixed Sweet/Hot Sausage, Pepper & Onion Sammy. I could hear the kitchen folk chatting away and banging pans and oven doors as they prepared takeout orders along with mine. \n\nThe regular slice (well done) arrived first. It was a little heavy with cheese and dripping oil, but the first bite was still crisp with nicely charred undercarriage and very good red sauce. It was better than it looked. The sausage P&O likewise didn't look like a work of art, but when the sauce was dripped on top, it came alive with great flavor, texture and interplay amongst the ingredients and torpedo roll. The sausage mix demonstrated it may have been locally produced, from the freshness of the chew and subtlety of the flavors. In any event, it was an exceptional; a best of breed for me this year. \n\nI hear the Sarappo family has another restaurant in Croydon, PA. It is now bookmarked for future exploration.",

When my 12 year old wanted to take me out for a good meal for Father's Day, Blue Sage came to mind.  I called at 10:00 on Sunday morning and was fortunate to secure a table for 2:30 that afternoon.  By no stretch am I a vegetarian, but I do enjoy a tasty healthy meal at any time.  \n\nWe arrived a couple of minutes late after canoeing in Tyler State Park ran a little long (that's another story), and were seated promptly.  The staff was friendly and knowledgeable. The brunch menu is a shorter version of the regular menu with several specials thrown in. It's a one from Page One and one from Page Two deal for $18., including organic coffee.  \n\nI ordered the Corn Johnnie Cakes with Berries and the Relleno.  The Cakes looked like four small dark pancakes topped with Strawberries and Blueberries.  It was pulled together with a Sweet Cream Butter whip that was just sweet enough, but did not interfere with the berry flavors, nor the hot corn cakes.  It was delicious.  The Relleno was a Red Pepper stuffed with mild melted cheese, beans, onions and red/orange cherry tomatoes.  It was finished with a tawny copper colored tangy sauce that made me glad I had a spoon so I could claim every drop.  I was completely satisfied.  My son had two different dishes of Sweet Rice Pudding balls and Mashed Potato Empanadas which he enjoyed. They were filled with red pepper pumpkin seed pesto mixed with the potato, and it came with Giant White Beans pickled, Gazpacho Sauce, and a Tomato - Avocado Salad. I know this because he only reluctantly allowed me to taste them. \n\nThis would have been a delectable meal on any day of the year.  That is culminated Father's Day for me makes it vastly more memorable.  I will be sure to consider Blue Sage on my list of \"go to\" places on special occasions.  It was a great place to complement a great day.",

    "text": "It is really nice to have expectations exceeded by a local slow/fast food shop. That was exactly what happened yesterday when we visited Curly's Comfort Food in Levittown, PA. \n\nWhy \"slow/fast\"? Because although Curly does cheesesteaks, burgers, chicken and all the accessories, which are typically considered fast food; it is so slammed with people ordering and waiting for their food that the first thing the ordertaker said to me was that there was a one hour wait for pickup. After ordering their Diablo Cheesesteak with fried onions, Firecracker Crisp Chicken Sandwich and standard Burger, she asked for my phone number to be able to alert me when the kitchen had prepared everything. Well, okay. We walked across the parking field to the H Mart for a little casual shopping in that well stocked Asian market. \n\nAll the reviews suggesting the Curly's cheesesteak is the best of breed in the region. That is no lie! My son opened a zoftig sesame seeded long torpedo roll with enough thin sliced beef, cheese, jalapenos, and onions to fill at least two regular sized 'steaks.' He cut off a two inch end of the massive creation for me to taste, and he still couldn't finish it. My small sampling left me wanting more. It was a perfect roll wrapped around a glorious mix of deliciously delivered ingredients, complete with raw onion and sliced tomato. \n\nSimply stunning! \n\nThe Firecracker Chicken wasn't far behind. Breaded and deep fried, it was a large breast with strong spice content, mayo, lettuce and tomato. I felt sorry for the round Kaiser roll attempting to hold it all together. It really couldn't, so before I was half way through it, I grabbed a knife and fork to assist. It was also excellent, and an unspoken contender in the chicken sandwich wars being waged by the franchises. Watch out, Popeye's and Chik-Fil-A! \n\nThe burger was the simplest on the menu, but still a half pounder surrounded by a copious load of pretty good fries, in the same Kaiser roll, with the requested medium finish. Who ever heard of a takeout joint paying enough attention at the grill to deliver the right doneness? Curly did! \n\nSure, the bill for all this quantity and quality was in the mid $40s. As I paid with that 3% credit card surcharge, I hoped it would all be worthwhile. Truth is that it was worth every penny and perhaps more, although that surcharge is obnoxious, and they would be doing a civic service to eliminate that, as it discriminates against the majority of consumers who are part of our credit economy.\n\nPRO TIP - You have to ask them to switch the Diablo Chicken Steak to a Beef version which was not on the paper menu. It costs a little more, but definitely the way to go.",

    "text": "The Stuff'd Bunz food trailer was set up outside the Newtown Brewery last weekend. The two women inside were constructing a variety of sliders (see menu photo) at $4 per. We ordered a Pulled Chicken composition and Philly Cheesesteak Sammy on the way out of the beer den after purchasing a 4-pack of home grown suds. \n\nWhile the Belgian Tripel went of $23, the amazingly tasty sliders were boxed expertly for $8 for a deuce, prepared the way you want it. Ample sauces, peppers, onions, relishes and melty cheese to beat the band. When we arrived home five minutes later, we broke open the grub and brew at the kitchen table and went off devouring the solids and guzzling the liquids. \n\nReally, the Stuff'd Bunz were terrific; plenty of flavors and textures to entertain the tastebuds, and leave you wanting more. Strong BBQ base under sours and sweets and crunchies, held together by something that reminded of a potato bun. Even the mock Cheesesteak was a big chew hoot and a half. Gooey cheese over finely chopped beef, with onion mixed in. Not the Prince of Steaks, but a damn good facsimile. \n\nWashed all that down with the expensive amber ale, and we were sated, if not poorer for the experience. When Covid is defeated, I look forward to hanging out at the bar and enjoying the wonderful repast to the fullest. Until then, takeaway is the only safe way to go.",

    "text": "Szechuan House remains one of my favorite Chinese restaurants in the Mercer/Bucks region. While it doesn't have everything nailed down in terms of consistency of flavor and presentation, it makes a strong statement for traditional Szechuan cuisine. They recently reopened after a lengthy renovation, and although the vibe is the same, it does appear cleaner on the dining room floor and likely in the kitchen, too. \n\nWhile food from Chengdu and Chongqing is more common here these days than it was decades ago, it remains an acquired taste for most consumers with its heavy hot chili spice and oil content. It is nothing like the sweeter Cantonese offerings found in Chinese American joints across the continent. For me the shift to preferring the numbing black peppercorns and flaming small red chillies over General Tso and the rest, came from my prolonged exposure to the kitchen heat during eight years I spent working and exploring the Middle Kingdom, primarily in Szechuan and Yunnan provinces. For me, eating this style food brings me back to the adventurous days when I became acculturated to this cooking, and loved life there. \n\nI would never say this is the best representation of Szechuanese cuisine in the western world, but it is damn good and satisfying. Yes, part of its attraction for me is reminiscing about the past, and they do need to use more peppercorns to capture the numbing elements of what I like most, but unless I want to travel to China to satisfy my yearnings, Szechuan House is about as good as it gets for the gestalt I seek. \n\nPS. Yes, Philly has some very strong candidates - Han Dynasty, Chili Szechuan, Chengdu Famous, Four Rivers and Ermi, among the best - they are not appreciably superior to S.H., although I love them all.",

    "text": "I returned to Szechuan House, the hidden treasure of a restaurant found on Rt. 33 in Hamilton Township, Mercer County, New Jersey, for another mouth numbing meal last week.  The last time I was there I underwent a root canal the next day without need of additional anesthesia.  It was that good! \n\nYes. This is a joke, but you might not think it funny if you don't take the warning seriously. If you are thinking \"Mexican\" spicy, you are in for a rude awakening.  Szechuan spicy is an entirely different dimension of heat.  I love Jalapenos and Habaneros, and even Ghost Peppers, and you can pile them onto my Flautas without me blinking.  Put an equivalent amount of Szechuan peppercorns, hot chili oil, and those cute little red Chinese peppers into a dish, and your review goes from 5 Star to 5 Alarm.\n  \nI love it, but it is an acquired taste. As someone said about this style food, \"Numb is a flavor.\"\n \nLast week, I was surrounded by Dan Dan Noodles with Minced Pork and Chili Vinaigrette, Steamed Dumplings with Chili Vinaigrette, Amazing Eggplant (that's the name), and Hunan Beef.  \n\nThe Dan Dan's were spaghetti diameter, and had a nice ground pork sauce with a mild spicy quotient.  Very tasty and a nice start to the meal. (4 Star/3 Alarm)\n\nThe Steamed Dumplings with Chili Vinaigrette was found in the Szechuan Delicacies part of the menu toward the back page.  Six fairly large, hand stuffed and pinched, with the red chili oil and vinegar for a bath. There was a pleasant sweetness that I experienced before the heat arrived. Not sure how that was done, but it played well on my tongue. (5 Star/4 Alarm)\n\nThe Amazing Eggplant came on a large plate piled with the thin Chinese Eggplant, in a brown, spicy sauce with a light meat base.  This was delicious and stole the show. Tender, medium heat, and addictive. (5 Star/3 Alarm)\n\nHunan Beef came with an equal supply of broccoli in a shining brown Hunanese sauce.  The beef was thin sliced and very tender.  The Chinese chilies swam in the sauce at the bottom of the serving bowl.  Solid choice, if not completely inspiring.\n(4 Star/ 3 Alarm).\n\nThis was a totally satisfying meal, reminding me of my Chengdu daze.  The 5 Alarm dishes were not selected this time as my friends were not accustomed to Szechuan cuisine, and they needed to be broken in slowly.  But, if you are ready for the HEAT, I suggest the Fish Fillet in Hot & Spicy Sauce, the Diced Rabbit with Szechuan Peppercorn Vinaigrette (a cold dish with serious hot), or the Beef in Hot & Spicy Sauce to begin your Vulcan adventure.",

High burn with every crunchy morsel. Just below numb on the volcanic scale, perhaps not reaching conflagration due to the meager presence of Szechuan black peppercorns and reliance on red chillies to cover for their absence, but still excellent. \n\nThe Crispy Fish Fillets Sweet & Sour was a large deep platter full of lightly fried fish and loads of orangey thick sauce. More Cantonese, but a strong interpretation. Really liked it in the face of all the other flames. \n\nThe few other plates were good, but not worth taking up more space here in light of all the other fireball delights found in this still surprisingly authentic Chengdu palace.",

    "text": "When my last order of locally roasted coffee beans was about to run out, I looked around online for other bean purveyors to sample. Liberty City Roasters in Bristol, PA, jumped out with a website that exuded passion for their craft. Last Friday I ordered Yirgacheffe and Peruvian 8 oz. bags, drip grind, @ $8.95 per, plus a reasonable shipping charge. They were on my doorstep Saturday afternoon, and brewing in our autodrip Sunday morning. This was quite amazing for a small company, and I suspect that someone in management drove it over to us on his way home from work. \n\nGotta love that level of personal service! \n\nWe regularly buy fresh roasted beans, and have adapted our pantry to hold the coffee in our own containers for longer storage. We customize each by cutting and affixing the labels from the roaster to our jars when received so we always know what we are drinking and take pride in our handiwork. \n\nI've now sipped mugs of both, and can report on my experience. Yirgacheffe is a smaller bean (a/k/a Peaberry), from south central Ethiopia in a micro region of the Sidamo area. The hot days/cool nights at 7,000 feet above sea level are perfect conditions for producing mellow java. This coffee is great in a light to medium roast. It is mildly acidic and gentle on the tongue. It taste clean with a flavor of berries, lemon and perhaps, sweet peanut. Some say a hint of coconut emerges under certain roasting, but I don't know about that. Still, this is my favorite coffee overall, and our beans are an excellent example from the birthplace of coffee. \n\nThese Peruvian beans are similarly expertly roasted to allow peak enjoyment of its java. Its juice is more acidic that the Yirgacheffe, and has a stronger taste, but remains smooth and soft on the pallet. It has a light flavor of  fig, cherry and maybe a touch of peach undertone. It was balanced and lithe. My first encounter was fun and memorable. \n\nAt $8.95 for 8oz, the price was reasonable and only a small premium over mass produced coffee, even those bagged variants with well known names that still roast by the ton, not small batch. \n\nVery impressive first take.",

    "text": "All reviews are in the end subjective.  Sometimes all the variables are evaluated, but in other instances one aspect so dominates that the other pieces are minimized by comparison.  For me, when the atmosphere of a restaurant so overcomes me with a sense of comfort and well being that the food or service tends to fade quickly, I react emotionally and start to fall in love with the entire experience.  I can't help it. I'm a hopeless romantic. \n\nSo it was with Coffee Cup Caf\u00e9 on Bellevue Avenue, just off one of the ugly parts of business Route 1. I had seen the place for years, but was never tempted to stop and frisk the joint until reading the Yelp reviews.  It seemed like a decent place for breakfast, so I set aside a morning when not too busy to stop in.  \n\nStepping inside after parking on the street in front, I immediately felt the effect of time warping taking me to circa 1980.  An old counter with about 6 or 7 spinners, and large kitchen service window in the wall behind, and more classic coffee mugs hanging on the walls than I could count. There was a nice size dining room to the side, and another tiny one right in front of the building.  Everything white with blue trim.  \n\nThen Beth approached from behind the counter and asked if I wanted coffee.  \"Yes, Mam,\" as I took in her vivacious eyes and well-tatted skin.  Well, all right!  This woman had a story to tell, and I hoped she would share it.  After mentioning this was my first visit, she gave me the history of Coffee Cup Caf\u00e9 back through the early 1970's.  She was second generation ownership, and her son, Jesse, working the kitchen grill would be the third.  She was proud and loud, and she was a groove. She welcomed me to look around, and even step into the galley for a photo. \n\nThe food?  It was just fine.  Coffee hot and fresh.  Breakfast sandwich loaded on a Kaiser roll and able to fill my happy stomach.  I could have hung out there all morning. I felt like a friend and guest of the house.  Some places are just that way.\n\nHow many coffee mugs are found in Coffee Cup Caf\u00e9?  \n\nI'll never tell.",

    "text": "This Jahan Kabob is the sister ship to a joint by the same name on Oxford Valley Road in Langhorne.  Yeah! That's right. The place tucked into the corner of a craft beer store just behind the Super Wawa.  But, the similarity ends with the name.  \n\nAbdul the owner and chef remembered me from the other place and gave me a smile.  His daughter sat by the register taking orders and making friendlies with the customers.  While waiting in line and perusing the take out menu, I took a look around this brand new Afghani/Middle Eastern establishment.  The bright neon beckoned all who find Morrisville an interesting, if offbeat, destination.  The floors were covered with oriental rug runners giving the space a feel of ethnicity, and in the rear stood a low platform with 6 meditation pillows for the Believers who felt the demand to pray before dining.\n\n Ah Salaam Ahlaikum, my brothers and sisters. \n\nWhen I entered I had intended to pick up and go, but the vibe (and aroma) was so unusual, that I decided to find a table to enjoy my meal right there.  When I reached the front of the line I had not decided what I wanted.  I asked Kadrianne what she recommended.  Abdul heard me, and turned from the grill to answer, \"Chicken Curry is what you want.\" \n\nObediently, I agreed. Sometimes, Kismet takes a hand. \n\nHe was totally right.  A few minutes later a plate full of thick yellow golden gravied Chicken chunks and a large pile of Long Grain \"Dirty\" Rice was placed before me. The flavors came through my nose first almost bringing me to tears. My tongue joined the festival a second later.  It is amazing how different curry tastes around the world, because this was neither Indian, nor Thai curry, but something in between.  Cooler and more subtle than it Indian brothers, and suggesting a tartness that its Thai cousins have mastered.  It was unique and savory; smooth and expressive.  The Rice was wonderfully mildly sweet in contradistinction to the Chicken. It seemed the obvious thing to do was mix them together.  That was a moment to remember as my oral senses rejoiced. \n\nThe green Afghani Tea was a good astringent between shoveling the delectables into my mouth.  The Sesame Cookie at the end of the meal, a kind token of appreciation.  \n\nThe other reviews are on target in 5 Starring Jahan Kabob.  This is a special place that will get even better with time, and become a landmark helping put Morrisville back on the cuisinery map where it belongs.",

    "text": "It's great to have a high end Napolitan pizza house in Newtown!  It's even better that the enterprise is owned by Pasquale and Anna, the proprietors of Osteria Vecchia, the excellent casa Italiana right down the street. This shop is for the daughter and son-in-law.  Thus, begin empires. \n\nThe building is on the site of the former Minuteman Press.  That old structure was taken down to the foundation, and a new Euro-Country Casual establishment arose.  Attention to detail is obvious, as the space is beautiful, with quality stone, wood, glass and a \"just off the boat\" wood burning hive oven covered in red glazed tile and contrasting white ceramic lettering that shouts, \"Pasquale & Anna/Acqua e Farina!\"  \n\nWe were greeted by Sal, the maestro de la casa, who sat my son and I at the corner table where we could see the whole operation.  We ordered a Siciliana pie, and as we waited, other servers brought thin slices of red sauced bread, and a small plate of Brussel sprouts that were soft and delicious from their time swimming in olive oil and spices.  I was even offered a glass of red wine on the house. Very cool touch!\n\nThe pie arrived with steam shimmering above it, on a large white platter.  It was cut in quarters, and covered in mozza, afterburn peccorino and chunks of eggplant.  Truly, a work of art with the bubbled crust and scorched undercarriage.  The special deal with these ovens is that they hold extremely high heat, such that the raw pie is placed in the oven for less than three minutes, while baking everything quickly and capturing all the flavor of the ingredients before they burn off and escape. The result is a wonderfully textured and tasty crust that is flavored by the ingredients you choose.  It is all about the dough (thus, the name, Water & Flour), and secondarily about the toppings.  Quite different than the better known pizza experience provided by most joints. \n\nSo it was here. A beauty to behold, and a pleasure to consume.  Of course, there is a downside to this approach to baking.  While the crust is excellent, the more ingredients you put on top, the wetter the center of the pie will be on the plate, because it is not possible to fully cook the veggies and meats in such a short time, and as a result of the lack of evaporation in the oven, the finished product will be softer that normal, and the drip from the collected moisture under the hood will be noticeable, and require care to avoid making a mess. \n\nThe secret is to order a simple pie with minimal topside accessories, so that the crust, cheese and sauce have the maximum opportunity to vent off the moisture.  This provides a drier bottom and optimal crustiness. \n\nDining at Acqua & Farina is very different than eating at pizza parlors.  It is designed as a feast for the senses.  There are more moving parts, and the resulting cost enhancement is noticeable. There is a time when \"two slices and a soda,\" is what you want, but there are also times when although you yearn for pizza, you want a more rousing experience.  \n\nAt those moments, Acqua e Farina will be calling your name.",

While it makes little difference for some of the other vendors' products in the too small building, sushi is an art form as well as a food product.  How it is prepared, presented and eaten makes a difference to the Zen experience that so enhances Sushi-Do. \n\nIt is like watching a master at work when the sharp knives flash, the sticky rice is molded into seaweed wraps, and out of the efficient motions of the chef emerges a work of art that you hate to disturb by eating.  It is quite a dilemma.  How much better it would be if you could sit along side a gurgling stream and listen to the songbirds as each morsel was praised before eating. (Sounds a bit like Oishi). \n\nBut, that isn't happening here, so the best you can do is take it home and devour it quickly to capture its fresh essence before it slips away, or just \"damn the torpedoes,\" and find a couple of empty chairs and enjoy it while everyone around you jostles for a place to sit, or scrape their tables and chairs to get in or out.  \n\nIf you have a Zen mind none of this will matter as you just shut it all out while you contemplate the exchange of energy from fish to you, and back again.",

Take a walk on the wild side past the bakery and chilis aisle, around the canned goods and wall of packaged tortillas, and finally humbly by the multitude of Madre Maria statuary looking down from the high shelves, into the eating area. Pull out a chair at a small table and await the friendly bilingual servers to present the large menu and take your drink order from the homemade fruit drinks and rice horchata. \n\nI picked the Torta Milanesa de Pollo (fried breaded chicken sandwich) thinking it was a good way to introduce myself to the chef's skills.

I could only eat half, and brought the rest home, where my 19 year old son devoured it in seconds, uttering only a muffled \"Wow, this IS good,\" as he came up for air.\n\nIt was the second best thing I had consumed this year, after the Greek dessert I ate last week in Princeton.

I loved the large windows, dropped period lighting, white ceramic tile, wood plank floors, and the friendliness of the staff. \n\nI ordered an egg and cheese breakfast sandwich on croissant, with mug o' joe. It came in at about $8, and while ordering was at the counter in back, the servers brought the sandwich to my table. They would be wise to advertise the coffee roaster more dominantly both in the store and online, as I am sure I was not the only one curious about who produced the quality beans. The croissant was not quite French boulangerie, but still large and tasty enough to be satisfying. \n\nStill, the atmosphere here is the star of the show. It is a great place for both solitary and collective pleasures.",

    "text": "All good things come to an end, so when my 13 year old war horse Infiniti finally went to the junkyard in metal heaven, I was sad, but not really surprised. Over 200,000 miles is a long life. It didn't owe me anything, and I had beaten the crap out of it.\n\nI began a search for a replacement by checking with Car Gurus, an internet site that had been successful for me in the past. I thought I wanted to stick with the Infiniti brand, but find something newer in a quality used car. Compared to Lexus there were amazingly few oldies but goodies around. That was precisely why I chose Infiniti to begin with. Just didn't want the most popular in school, but that hidden understated gem. \n\nOn the second search I found a newer M 35x with low mileage on the lot at Holman Infiniti over in Maple Shade, New Jersey, about 25 miles away. \n\nI gave them a call to find out if it was still there, and spoke with Mario Pinardo in their sales department. He went out to check and came back enthusiastic about how good the vehicle looked - Pearl White with light leather interior. I expected him to try to sell it, but he seemed naturally excited by what he saw. I asked him to hold it for me until tomorrow. He said he could only do so until 11:00 AM Tuesday. \n\nI was there at 10:00. \n\nThis M 35x was worth being excited about. Perfect body. Not a scratch, dent nor ding. Immaculate within, with beautiful wood trim, sleek and sexy front and back. Well detailed to a perfect glowing leather, wood and metal trim. The drive was strong, responsive, with throaty exhaust and acceleration that offered no apologies for being six cylinders, 3.5 liters, as opposed to the eight 4.5 L the old boy threw around. Better gas mileage, too. And, the price for all that was very reasonable, and made it nearly impossible to walk away from. \n\nYup! An hour later it was mine and I drove it home. \nThe experience at Holman was excellent from beginning to end. The dealership is large, but they kept everything at a comfortable human scale. Mario was great. He was genuine, engaged and led us through the process with precise guidance. Even the minutes with the finance manager were decent. I didn't mind that he was a Cowboys fan.",

I sat at the counter with a couple of other dudes and engaged in interesting conversation with my neighbor to the left and the owner of the establishment, while I enjoyed a Veggie Omelet, Rye toast and Coffee.\n\nThe three egger filled the plate from rim to rim, and was loaded with broccoli, spinach, onion, tomato, mushrooms and the home fried potatoes, I requested be placed inside the omelet. A few splashes of Tobasco and I was hot to trot. Very filling, tasty and satisfying, with plenty of refills of my coffee mug. \n\nOur discussions covered many issues of the day, including mask wearing for school children (some initial disagreement, but we found common ground), the U.S. Constitution (I received free copies from the owner, which he distributes to everyone), the CCP (Chinese Communist Party - all opposed) and illegal opioid black market sales by pharmaceutical companies (put the bastards in jail). We clearly came from different perspectives and had desperate sources of information, but reached some consensus due to our calm, respecting demeanor and good grub. It was the best exchange I have had with strangers in a long time. \n\nFor that alone a fifth star is awarded in appreciation.",

The ambiance is def Taiwanese old school, with Grace and son working the Hario syphon butane java makers with aplomb and verve.  The best locally roasted beans are used to make single cups of joe, that are delivered to the table on a small tray, with doily and excellent butter cookie aboard. Little spout of milk on the side. \n\nThe Ethiopian Yirgacheffe beans from Main Line Coffee Roasters, were freshly ground the moment before their boiling bath and syphoning through the beautiful glass system, producing a superb cuppa joe. Not to put too fine a point on it, but this was among the very best coffee I have ever enjoyed. To watch Grace make my cup from grinding through pouring, was to see an artist at work. Perfect temperature. Perfectly balanced acidity.  A pleasure to imbibe. Easy to become addicted.  The Hario equipment was lined up on her counter, and the butane burner emitted a cool blue flame that brought the filtered water to a boil and flushed it up the tube and down through the coffee against a cloth filter.  Pure alchemy! \n\nEven the butter cookie with the colorful sprinkles was a winner. Hard and crisp, the way it should be. \n\nYes. At $5 a cup, this is not for the faint hearted. But, for coffee lovers and mavens, going to Ray's is a trip to the mountaintop to sit at the feet of the javamaster.",

Her friendliness and genuine interest in her customers matches perfectly with the homemade candy she creates. She explains that she is a first generation American of Chinese heritage who worked in a law office before discovering her true calling as a chocolateer. \n\nHer small shop in the Pheasant Valley Center on Buck Road, Holland, PA, feels a bit enchanted upon walking in. There is a wall of shelves holding most of the milk, semi sweet and dark chocolate offerings, seductively packaged and fairly priced. They grab your attention until Lily's voice calls you across the room to where she sits packaging her goods and overseeing the operation. She asks what you like, makes suggestions, and offers samples to help convince you to take a deep dive into her cacao universe. \n\nJust follow her lead. She won't disappoint. \n\nI purchased a box of peanut butter cups and buckeyes, and sampled sea salt caramel chocolate covered cashews (sultry), sriracha honey peanuts (mildly sweet with a chili bite), and a German waffle cookie (Stroopwafel) dipped in milk chocolate with caramel center(nice crisp base for the creamy brown blanket and that sticky caramel kick). The peanut butter was high quality (way better than Skippy), creamy smooth that melded wonderfully with the equally soft and sexy chocolate casing. Made me wonder how anyone introduced to these babies could ever go back to Reece's!? (Rhetorical question - They can't.) \n\nWell, maybe for Halloween, but otherwise I'd rather go for Lily's best - eat fewer, but kvell so much more. \n\nLily's Chocolate Paradise is where to go for your chocolate fix. Yes. There other a few other custom chocolate shops around, but none with Lily's exceptional personality, nor at such affordablilty. \n\nThis is rich indulgence for the people!",

Time flies! \n\nI was driving by this morning after court, having skipped breakfast at home in order to get a jump on traffic going into the city.  I saw a new sign out front on a Bud Light white board that breakfast was now being served 7 days a week!  \n\nHot diggity!\n\nI parked out back and walked in to a mostly empty bar (2 customers who looked like they were regulars).  The bartender approached and we engaged about their breakfast menu.  It was pretty wide open if my desires had anything to do with eggs.  They did. I opted for a sausage, egg and cheese on Kaiser roll, and mug of java.  While it was being created in the kitchen I watched a show about exotic car auctions.  A Borgati opening at a cool million bucks was an eye opener.  Another black transport used by John Lennon around London was also put up and sold.  Pretty cool entertainment. \n\nThe sandwich was great!  Double patty, fried egg, American cheese and a fresh, quality roll, made for a tasty and fun meal.  The side of homefries was likewise excellent - hot, crisp and spicy with saut\u00e9ed onions in the mix. Coffee, strong and kicking. The only shortcomings were the lack of a joe refill offering, and lack of utensils. Luckily, I had a spoon from the coffee, which was fine as a shovel.  \n\nAfterall, Marty's is still a wonderful corner dive.  It was made for comfort, not for speed, nor etiquette.",

It was nice to return to the friendly, comfy confines of this fine house. \n\nThis morning, I was the only patron at the counter and Marie was my attentive server. She was solicitous and informative, keeping my coffee mug full, and providing a glass of milk for the coffee rather than the ubiquitous tiny creamers.  I finally had the strength to move beyond the excellent French Toast and try something new.  \n\nToday I moved on to the Greek Omelet.  It was spectacular with a pile of crunchy edged Home Fries, and Rye Toast.  The 3 egg platter was loaded with peppers, onions, tomatoes, Italian sausage, and feta cheese. They blended together well on the tongue, and with a little black pepper on top was terrific.  The taters could not be finished as they occupied nearly half the large plate.  Still, they were the right combo of crunch and tender properly spiced with a hint of butter to sweeten the palate. \n\nIt was a huge and hugely successful breakfast complete with good service and lots of fresh coffee.  \n\nIt is not hyperbole to say that Caf\u00e9 Chorba is as good as it gets for breakfast in the area and beyond. \n\nTime for an upgrade to 5 Stars.",

    "text": "A new generation of \"comfy casual\" dining is sprouting around the nation, and its seeds have germinated in Mt. Holly.  Kitchen 87 has taken root and its flowers are blooming even in the depth of winter.  While most diners, luncheonettes and caf\u00e9s are second or third generation owned and operated, or simply maintaining the status quo under new management, this creekside establishment is going in a new direction.  Young owners with fresh ideas and fine execution bring streetlife and adventurous palates to once bucolic Mt. Holly.  \n\nDon't get me wrong, I love the traditional places making good food and reminding me of home.  Yet, there is plenty of room for a joint using the same ingredients, but reconstructing the menu into something unique and totally enjoyable, while keeping the sense of hearth and home through their use of most of the same tools and kitchenware with which we are all familiar.\n\nFrom the vantage point of a counter stool, a spin around shows a wall lined with booths, a bunch of tables mid-floor, and a swinging kitchen door through which very friendly and gregarious servers come and go.  They are obviously proud of what they are doing, and want to share their confidence and happiness at being part of this enterprise.  I had good conversations with two women who were interested in more than just light pleasantries.  They really wanted to know what I thought about their place, and a slice of my worldview.  I was pleased to share.  \n\nMy breakfast was on par with everything else that was happening inside Kitchen 87.  I had the \"Which Came First\" Sandwich - Breaded Chicken Patty, Swiss, Fried Egg, on a Brioche Roll, with Home Fries on the side.  It was a hot, happy, delicious, mess.   Knife and fork were mandatory, as it was too big and slick to be handled.  Everything melded well together, with drippy egg running through everything and giving its blessing to the rest.  The taters were dark grilled and spiced just right.  I really enjoyed every bite, although I could not finish the side.  The Coffee was brewed strong and the pot returned to me several times. \n\nIn the mood for a great breakfast that challenges you preconceptions about what can be done with eggs, cheese, bread, meat and potatoes?  \n\nYou are ready for Kitchen 87.",

It sits in a small commercial strip on West Moreland Avenue, Hatboro; the last storefront, farthest from Blair Mill Road. \n\nOnce inside, you find about ten tables with the counter and kitchen in the back of the house. I was greeted warmly by one of the owners, who guided me to a corner table and handed me their menu. Most of the offerings were Mexican, with a few Salvadoran specialties. I selected the chili rellenos (stuffed chili) dinner, which included rice, beans and a basket of four hot tortillas. \n\nIt took a while for my meal to arrive, but when it did, I immediately saw how big the poblano pepper was, and was advised by la senora that the dish was made from scratch for me. I could taste the difference. The queso stuffing was plentiful; the egg wrap completely encased the pepper, and the red salsa on top was fresh and piquant. A totally delicious take on this standard. This was one of my favorite Mexican dishes taken to a new level of satisfaction. Yes. It was worth the wait. \n\nI also appreciated the old school approach to the chips and salsa gracing my table gratis. In the new world where many restaurants now charge for this table snack, it was very nice to have them placed in front of me with just a smile. In that regard, the chips were served warm and crunchy. The salsa was placed on the table in plastic rockets for squirting into small black bowls. They were smooth versions of hot sauce, and at first I missed the chunks of tomato, pepper and onion. The taste was the same, it just lacked the thickness I normally associate with salsa. I'll give them a pass on that. \n\nThis King of Diamonds is a full house of Mexican/Salvadoran cuisine. Definitely, worth a stop on your visits south of the border.",

I haven't made it past the omelets, French Toast, breakfast sandwiches and a Quesadilla, but all have been at the very least, very good.  \n\nPRO TIP - Try to sit in the old original boxcar dining room.  It is so well maintained it feels like you are chowing down in a museum.  It makes everything taste even better.",

Only one table was occupied by women in bonnets, although a few people came in to pick up take out orders. Sherry was running the floor, and cheerily brought me the clipboard menu along with a cool copper mule mug of water and lemon. Prices were on the high side, but given the description of the food and Sherry's enthusiasm for each of them, I accepted that this was a \"budget be damned\" moment. I ordered the chicken milanese sandwich with side salad. The order in, I then saw Ms. Cattani herself putting my meal together. She waved and said hello while cheffing for me. \n\nTurns out she is basically a self taught uber foodie, who decided to open her open shop after working for other restaurants for several years. She is self taught and obviously a great student of her craft. \n\nMy lunch arrived on a thin wood plank. Minimalist, but strikingly presented. A feast for the eyes, and ultimately, the stomach. The chicken breast was pounded into a thin steak, lightly breaded in Italian crumbs and pan fried, with marinated peperonata, parmesan and aged balsamic drip on a crusty seeded \"rustic\" torpedo roll. It was delicious. No one off, this. Each element made a contribution to the overall work of art. I like milanese dishes, and even prepare them at home. Still, none are as interesting and tasty as this, and it was just a sandwich! What would it have been as a stand alone fully plated dinner? Don't know, but a week later I am still thinking of when to find out. \n\nAll the while, Sherry was seeing to the incoming phone orders and refilling my water mug during the gaps in the calls. Service was friendly and informative. I was well cared for. \n\nThis was a superior lunch from an unexpected source.\n\n Surprise was perhaps the tastiest part of the dish.",

    "text": "Arriving at 3:30, I learned Ban Bamboo closed for two hours on Saturday afternoon and reopened at 4. So, I had a little time to wander along Ridge Avenue and take in the beautiful Spring day and the local color. The street scene was active with outdoor seating at the brewery and many open doors allowing the kitchen aromas to waft out to we pedestrians. Definitely created the aura of being a neighborhood. \n\nWhen BB's \"Open\" sign lit, I went in to discover a small dining area with lovely Buddha shrine front and center, and heavy southeast Asian decor all around. A cafe in Vientiane or Pattaya would look as good. I ordered Tom Kha Soup (veggie), Beef Satay, Red Curry (veggie), Drunken Noodles (chicken), and Kai Soi (beef), to go. It was 40 minutes to readiness, so I continued my exploration of the area while waiting, and thought about what I remembered about Lao and Thai cuisine. \n\nWhile both are very regionalized so that there are many distinctions even in different parts of each country. Still, there are a few generalities that hold true. Where Thai uses coconut milk in many dishes making it sweet, often counterbalanced by the heat of chili peppers and bitterness of lemongrass; Lao kitchens lack coconuts, and use more lime and fermented fish sauces for flavor. Lao is a lot saltier than Thai. \n\nSo, it was easy to know which was which in my package. The Tom Kha Soup came on strong on sweetness from its coconut milk/galangal base, followed immediately by a lemongrass bite. It could have used more variety of veggies in the bowl, but the taste profile set off a riot in my mouth. The Red Curry was similar in sweetness, but lit a fire from the chili paste used to turn the color crimson. The veggies were still semi firm, adding to the texture, along with the bell pepper, bamboo shoots and Thai basil. The Beef Satay was lean meat with excellent BBQ type sauce, and on the sweeter side. Drunken Noodles were definitely from Thailand in flavor and plenty spicy from roasted chili sauce. Kai Soi, on the other hand, was more a hybrid, using thin sliced beef in a coconut milk broth, mixed with egg noodles, red onion, cabbage and lemon/lime juices. It reminded of Indian curry with its sweet/sour profile. \n\nAlthough travel time neutralized the higher taste amplitudes to reduce the delicate intricacies that exited the kitchen, it was still a wonderfully entertaining meal that is well worth revisiting, along with this Ridge Avenue neighborhood.",

    "text": "Ratchada is a district in Bangkok known for less bustle while very entertaining. This Thai/Laotian house takes its name and atmosphere from this more mellow part of a very intense big city.  It is apt, as when walking in off of S. 11th Street (a half block off Washington), you immediately feel a sense of decompression and culture shift from urban hubbub to Asian serenity.  The dark wood tones, silks, and wall art invite you to leave the outside world behind, and wade into a secret jasmine scented pool of tranquility. \n\nHyperbole? Perhaps. But, after the week I just finished, it felt so to me. \n\nWe were seated immediately and on time by Jib, the diminutive whirlwind who seemed to be everywhere at once.  She was graceful, smiling, communicative and clearly loved what she was doing.  The menu was quickly explained and we were given ample time to peruse and select.  Tom Yum Nam Khon (Creamy Lemongrass Soup) and Tom Kha (Coconut Soup) to begin.  Fried Calamari to appetize.  Ratchata Duck (a Chef Special) to share.  \n\nThe soups were hot, spicy, loaded with veggies, and a great way to commence.  My taste buds were on alert to the complexity of each spoonful.  The Calamari had a beer batter that seemed a little off for the dish as it created a coating around the calamari rings that easily separated from the crustacean and made the eating a bit disjointed.  Still, it was very fresh and the Sriracha/sweet&sour peanut sauce was good enough to eat by itself. Nothing was left behind.\n\nThe star of the show was the Duck.  Its skin was crispy and the meat perfectly tender and moist.  The Mango/Tamarind mix that created the sauce that covered the bottom of the platter was simply exquisite.  So glad for the rice to absorb every drop after the duck was gone. Sweet/tart/creamy. There was ample sliced canard on the plate for two, and even a drumstick bone underneath for me to pick up and gnaw off the slim morsels.  \n\nThis was a thoroughly enjoyable and memorable dinner.  It put me in an excellent frame of mind to such an extent that we decided to have their Thai Tea Ice Cream for dessert.  It too, was revelatory.  How many times have I had Thai Iced Tea and never considered taking it the next step?  So glad someone around here had done so.  I mite expensive at $6. for a big scoop, but a great way to end a wonderful meal. \n\nRevisiting Ratchada is as desirable as it is inevitable.",

If you're looking for some zinc to enhance immunity, or K2 to offset possible bone density loss due to the extra D2 taken in this Age of Covid, or just stocking up on healthy frozen food, Bunn's is your little slice of heaven. \n\nThe staff is very knowledgeable about their inventory and will gladly walk you to the part of the store where your needs are answered, and provide explanations for the available choices. I found them particularly useful while attempting to purchase the correct dosage of a mineral recommended in reading I had done on the subject of enhanced immunity, and learned that a low dose would be more effective than a higher one of one element due to side effects. Always good to know.\n\nBunn's does enough volume to carry their own label vitamins at a excellent discount to the national brands. They built a new center for their business several years ago, which while still small by comparison to other retail spots, is expansive enough to carry what most people want in a clean and friendly environment. \n\nIn a difficult economy where many of these small local shops are closing, Bunn's is surviving fairly well and will hopefully continue to do so.",

    "text": "Excellent bagel joint in Doylestown Borough. Small customer area, with room in back for ovens, preparation, storage and display case. The rounders have a crisp biting crust, while the inside has enough air pockets to keep it fairly light enough to allow the flavor of the topping (roast onion flakes) or whatever is added in the prep(butter & Swiss) to come through strongly. \n\nI appreciate the bagel baker who knows not to knead the dough too long, which hardens the bread and makes it too dense. Too, here they are boiled and then baked in the right proportion to create the optimal bagel. \n\nHaving La Colombe and Ellis Coffee in house is also a big plus, as they are both top shelf Philadelphia roasters that have found success nationally and internationally.\n\n These Borough guys are not fooling around. They give their customers quality bagels and first class java for a fair price. It wouldn't surprise me if their success was assured and they grew their enterprise as far as they wanted to take it.",

    "text": "I never noticed this tiny pizza parlor nestled at the end of a small strip center with only 4 shops, but my never ending search for the perfect tomato pie brought me here late last week as the clouds gathered beckoning rain. \n\nAlthough small in stature, the menu is large with the usual suspects to be found in an Italianesque joint that has to move fast and be creative to complete in a universe full of larger predators. When I walked in, I was greeted by a short man (from central casting), wearing a backward baseball cap and speaking with a warm Spanish accent.  I asked if there were any slices of tomato pie available.  He apologized for not having any at the ready, but immediately offered to make a personal size TP for me if I had 10 minutes to wait.  Of course I did. \n\nI watched as he retrieved an aluminum dough container, peeled out the slowing rising mass and slapped it onto his cool granite countertop.  Fingering, spreading, stretching, spinning, tossing it just enough to get it to the right size without over-manipulating it to toughen the finished product.  He laid out the mozza neatly around the disk, and then flicked globs of chunky tomato sauce on top like he was Michelangelo in his abstract period. Satisfied, he slid his wooden long handled pizza mover underneath, turned, and gently shook it off onto the hot oven floor.  \n\nAbout 8 minutes later he was walking toward my table with a steaming large plate on which sat my personal Tomato Pie.  It was beautiful and its heat wave struck my nose and eyes at the same instant, causing me to catch my breath and shed a small tear.  \n\nI picked up the first wedge and held it for a moment.  It was straight and true, never wavering nor bending under the weight of the topside.  The under carriage was beautifully scorched, but not burnt.  First bite was amazing. My teeth cut through the tomato and cheese and felt the heat on my upper palate. My lower jaw clamped down, closing mid slice on a crisp firm crackery crust.  \n\nMagnificent!\n\nI had intended to eat half and bring home the rest, but it was so perfectly balanced between taste, texture and eye-rolling excellence, that I knew it would lose something essential if I did not eat the whole thing at that moment.  So, I did, and skipped dinner that night. \n\nIt's hard to tell if this experience could be duplicated, or if I had just stumbled into a apex moment that was beyond everyone's ability to recreate.  Regardless, this time was mine, and I offered thanks for having lived this one.",

From Josh the manager, to Channelle (#5) our server, right to the guy bussing the tables, everyone made a nearly superhuman effort to welcome us and show something of their personalities. Under some circumstances that could have felt cloying, but with these folk it was totally genuine and not overdone. \n\nThe dining area was up a narrow steep flight of stairs with the names of Philly neighborhoods written on the risers.  Good idea for keep our eyes where we were walking to avoid missteps.  The second story was bright with windows facing east, and yellow/gold painted walls all around. Lots of chachkas and potted plants. Channelle was to us in a blink, offering great coffee and mimosas/bloodies/orange juice.  The breakfast menu was a large page with their signature dishes - Hangover Sandwiches, Regular Breakfast Egg Sandies, Omelets, Waffles, etc. Even before ordering a Pastrami Omelet and Original Hangover creation, we received two homemade muffins compliments of the house.  Alcohol and bakery sweets gratis, just because...and, Josh stopped by to introduce himself and inquire where we were from and how we knew about CH2. Pleasant conversation.\n\nI'm not a pastrami guy, but my companion sure loved the load of smoked beef, Swiss cheese and saut\u00e9ed onions that filled her 3 egg plate.  My Original Breakfast Hangover Sandwich was a glorious monstrosity of 3 more eggs, garlic buttered sesame seed loaf, cheddar, sausage and their hash browns all in the mix.  Put hash browns inside my eggs and you know one of the keys to my soul.  With the first bite, my eyes involuntarily rolled to the back of my head, and I am told I emitted a low yowl. My inner wolf was free for a moment. Don't remember, but it was that good.  Don't think I bit anyone.\n\nDoubtless, we will return to this or the other Coffee House Too in the near future.

From my first bite this late September morning it seems they are succeeding. \n\nI was fortunate enough to ask the owner where the bagels were made, and he was happy to take me on an impromptu tour of the operation. I followed him behind the counter and through the kitchen door. The large boiling pot was full of brine and the rack was full of aluminum trays with bagels just out of their bath and chilling before going into the oven for finishing. I knew that the boil helped set the crust's consistency, and that lye or sugar/molasses water were traditionally the elixir of choice, but didn't know that brine was an option. \n\nIt certainly worked to produce a excellent bagel. Thin crust. Nice bite. Pleasant mildly salty malty dense texture within. With sweet butter and nutty Swiss slices, it was an enjoyable bagel. Decent java, too. \n\nWish Second Street Bagels well with its new ownership team.",

Their Richboro shop is the latest addition in the new commercial core of town on Second Street Pike. We stopped in for a late lunch after visiting Tanner's Farmers Market for our supply of fruits and veggies. Cat was our server.\n\nThe menu was interesting, but given the first time there and the hour of the day, we opted for their Brooklyn Pie with Meatballs, figuring we would have a small sample in house and take the rest home for the boys. As we waited, Cat brought us a small plate of cheese garlic bread. It was a pleasant forespice made from their pizza dough, but without plenty a garlicky pecorino. \n \nThe square Brooklyn arrived on a thin wood server and was settled on a wire basket stand mid table. It looked great in red, white, green and brown. First bite impression was crisp, firm and flavorful. Cut into twelve squares the edges were firm and easily held their weight without equivocation. The red sauce was nicely done with strong hints of garlic, basil and salt, counterbalanced by the basil and mozzarella. It was outstanding! The reheat job at home this evening was nearly as good according to the accounts by our sons. \n\nBacco deserves our pizza business given the paucity of quality tomato pie in Newtown (aside from Vince's). If their sandwiches and entrees are as good, they will have a long line of loyal customers.",

    "text": "COVID-19 TAKEOUT REVIEW\n\nThese are the times that try our souls.\n\nTo grab a break from constant at home dining, at least two or three times a week we pick up takeout meals from either a place we haven't tried before, but has been bookmarked for a long time, or an old reliable that for some inexplicable reason had dropped out of the rotation. So it was with Primo Hoagies in the Glen Roc Center near Trenton-Mercer Airport in Ewing, NJ.\nNothing like a premium submarine sandwich on a fresh sesame seeded torpedo roll to pleasure and comfort a weary heart. And, Primo, the former Italian deli out of Philly that is now an expansive regional franchise, knows how to bring that iconic satisfying experience home. \n\nWe ordered over the phone for curbside pickup and sent the 19 year old who is spending the rest of his college freshman year at home out to secure it. Ordering a Turkey Schwartzie (sliced roast turkey, Swiss, lettuce, tomato, sweet pepper relish and mayo),  Corned Beef Schwartzie, and traditional Roast Beef & Provo Hoagalone, at $10 per, we actually had enough for two meals after cutting them into quarters and mix/match sharing. Our separately purchased bag of uber crisp & spicy Herr's Jalapeno Potato Chips were the perfect counterpoint to the soft semi sweetness of the sandwiches. \n\nAnd, an outstanding mention is demanded for the wonderful bread encapsulating the quality ingredients. Those babies were so delicious with sesame seeds generously spread atop each creation that I could easily have been happy with just them and a shmear of butter. So good!\n\nAs we sat devouring dinner at the kitchen table we were able to forget the seeming war zone coronavirus had turned out peaceful community into for a few minutes and talk of normal things like before this disease ended our innocence. In times such as these, we must fully appreciate such moments together.",

Easy enough to get in, but a bit challenging when departing. Don't let that deter you, because once inside you enter a simple dining room with about a half dozen wood topped tables, and honest to goodness Thai dishes prepared with love and attention by folks who came naturally by their skills - they lived them from birth. No Thai pretenders here.\n\nI was there for a late lunch, arriving just short of 3:00 to an empty house. I was greeted warmly by two women, one the chef and the other working the front room. They thanked me for coming, directed me to a table in the front corner and handed me their small double sided menu. I was in time for the lunch special. I ordered a small bowl of tom yum soup, drunken noodles with beef and an iced tea. I asked them to bring the heat. \n\nThe soup was strongly spiced with lemongrass and loaded with veggies, including fresh mushrooms. The first spoonful took my breath away, but I adjusted to the spicy boil and enjoyed it the rest of the way. I asked for high flames and that was what I got. I was pleased they did not make any \"cultural adjustment\" for a presumed western pallette. The noodles were broad and mixed with peppers and other multicolored vegetables. Thin slices of grilled beef finished the plate, along with an excellent opulent brown sauce. Loved all of it. The 10% grand opening discount was another nice touch (without asking).\n\nService was attentive and attractive from the orange apron woman. She stopped by often to see how I was doing and to answer my questions. On my way out I asked to take a photo to memorialize my visit. My wish was granted. \n\nTake a look and tell me you wouldn't return as soon as possible for more authentic Thai cuisine!",

It reminds of the wineries in Napa and Sonoma with small acreage producing some of the best vintages. It is easy to relax , sample the wares and at least for a few moments be transported to the left coast. \n\nThis hacienda has been in the family for two generations, and the colonial home they live in looks the same as it did 200+ years ago (with better plumbing, electricity and fresh paint). Take a free tour of the grounds and production facilities, followed by a sit down on the patio in good weather to sip their award winning reds, whites and blushes. \n\nThe most engaging choice is the dark rouge and somewhat sweet and dusky Chocolate Cherry Truffle. The Viognier white, Cabernet and Merlot also merit consideration. While head on comparisons with California wines may not grade out well in every instance, they are competitive, and save the time and treasure of traveling west. Sometimes a pleasant afternoon is all you need to get away. \n\nIf you enjoy Crossing Vineyards it can be just the start of a magical mystery tour of the other Bucks County wineries that can make for a great weekend.",

Finding their parking lot behind the building after cruising by the storefront, I walked in to a warm smile from the owner/server, who directed me to a deuce along the wall, a discreet distance from the two occupied tables. She went to the rear cashier area and returned moments later with a glass of water and the two menus available for dinner and lunch specials. She quietly explained the two lists and left me again to give me time to consider my choices. \n\nI went with the afternoon combo - a small cup of coconut lemongrass soup (Tom Ka) veggied up with fresh mushroom on top, a bisected spring roll with dark orange dipping sauce, and a fairly large plate of Pad Kee Mao (Drunken Noodles). Liking spicy food, I opted for the \"Thai Spicy\" end of the heat spectrum. It did not disappoint. It added burn sufficient to make my tongue sweat and nose run, stopping just short of numbing my gums. Certainly no compromise for this western pallette.

It is a tight squeeze going through the front door and passing along the counter, but I found a spinner right there, and had the exalted pleasure of watching the action of the cooks, assistants and servers, as they danced around each other taking care of the hot steel grill and the crush of phone take out orders, while always finding time to chat with those around them with a quip and a smile. \n\nThis is definitely a greasy spoon dive, but in the best way possible. If you are entertained by fast hands and flying knives and spatulas, then there is no better theater in the City of Brotherly Love than a orchestra seat in the Clown House. You watch the action up close and personal, as take out orders are written directly on the white bags that will contain the food once cooked. No need for an order pad. And, if close enough to the grill, the occasional spattering of oil or home fries, or spitting bacon, will reach out to touch you gently, and remind you that there is no extra charge for the grease stains on your clothes. That iron is so full of food waiting to be off loaded onto plates or takeout boxes, that its amazing that the kitchen hasn't caught fire in the 66 years it has been slinging hash to the appreciative masses who have been scarfing their incredibly tasty dishes all this time. \n\n \"Delicious,\" is the right word for the food produced here. That grill is so well seasoned from decades of eggs, meats, potatoes, peppers and cooking oil, that it might be edible. The prices are cheap enough to be downright ridiculous. My sausage, egg and cheese sandwich on Kaiser roll, with a side of excellent home fries topped with saut\u00e9ed onions and green peppers, all the hot java I could drink, came to less than $7. \n\nARE YOU KIDDING ME?!\n\nSo, I had an incredible breakfast, a month's worth of local color, and full bore entertainment from the totally engaging staff, non-stop for the half hour or so I was indulging myself. Although a rookie, I felt at home and one of the regulars. I really didn't want to leave, but I finished eating, and the next customer was waiting to take my stool. \n\nPete's Clown House - One of those places that defines what is so special about Philadelphia.\n\n Definitely, a must see.",

    "text": "It is time to bump up the stars for Bagel Stop to 5 Big Ones! In fact, it is long passed time to do so. Please forgive my absent mindedness. \n\nHow do I know this is a supermax experience? \n\nBecause I find myself thinking about their excellent bagels even when I don't plan to be there that day, and excited when I know it is my destination. These babies have addicted me. They are my opioids. \n\nThe shop is still in the same location, and too small for tables and chairs. Yet, the master baker and his crew have perfected the onion bagel I prefer - firm skin, soft airy interior, and ample roasted onion flakes all around. When fresh from their ovens, they are plenty good enough to eat just as they come from the bin. If you time your visit just right, you can get them still warm from baking; nothing short of a completely memorable experience. Yet, even on the normal day when they have cooled and wait for your order in their bins, like puppies in the window of a pet store, they are simply a joy to consume with a heavy smear of favorite cream cheese (veggie, please!). \n\nI stopped in today for my weekly fix, and picked up a bag full for the family this weekend. I figured it's time to share the bagel bounty with those I love. \n\nThey do muffins and breakfast sandwiches, too. They look zoftig, but I am more the purest, preferring my bagels the traditional way. Just slice, smear and get out of the way!",

    "text": "Cheesesteak Review -\n\nDino's is primarily a take out pizza joint on Street Road in Warrington, PA. We wanted to eat while the food was prime, and opted to mange at one of the three tables in the front of the house. Son and I were in the mood for steak sandwiches, although the pizza looked appealing.\n \nThis Saturday night they had a three person operation in the kitchen, with Dino on the grill. The room was a bit chilly on an early December night, even with the little space heater. Still, hunger and strong aroma of the beef being chopped and tossed by the chef overcame any temporary discomfort.  \n\nThe sandwiches were excellent. Fresh crusty rolls, huge load of grilled beef made in house and sliced just before touching hot steel to guarantee juiciness and surprisingly good flavor. A work of culinary art. \n\nWe congratulated Dino for hitting the cheesesteak sweet spot, and assured him we would return. Never too far to go for a great Philly steak sammy. And, if the pizza is as good, the beginning of a long delicious relationship.",

    "text": "Apparently, this is the latest incarnation of a series of Banh Mi shops at this location, as a quick YelpCheck shows this place has had several names over the years, while working with the same people and offering substantially the same menu.  As Robert Burns wrote so well, \"A rose by any other name would smell as sweet.\"\n\nAnd, so it is for this small store on S. 8th Street just off Washington.  The space is clean, with about 7 tables, and a warm staff that is attentive, yet unobtrusive.  I had plenty of time to peruse the double sided laminated menu, but I really knew what I wanted coming in.  The rep here is about authentic Vietnamese Sandwiches, Banh Mi, although they also provide Pho, Vermicelli and Broken Rice dishes, along with a long list of VN Coffee and other beverages. \n\nThe fresh ingredients are on display in the glass enclosed refrigerator that separated the customers from the food prep area.  The work on my meal was in plain view.  It arrived a few minutes after ordering on a white plate covered in sandwich paper.  The Baguette was fresh with crunchy crust and soft airy inners. The Grilled Pork was plentiful and cut into small pieces at the bottom of the sandwich valley.  Daikon Radish, Cucumber, Carrot, and Cilantro were piled on top and overflowing.  \n\nI took a bite to start the proceedings, and was met with each of the components as they lustily exploded in my mouth.  Really a great first bite!  I added a squirt of Hoisin and Sriracha to bring up the volume a bit and to experiment to see how they would change the experience.  The Banh Mi was fine as it was, but I can be excessive when it comes to flavor, so the addition of both more BBQ flavor and Chili heat was pleasing. \n\nCaf\u00e9 Tranh Truc also has a few HDTVs on the wall, so I was able to enjoy a rewatching of The Hurt Locker during dinner.  \n\nThe entertainment was free.",

    "text": "The diversity of opinion on the Yardley Inn & Bar reflect that there is some inconsistency in the delivery of the product here.  Luckily for me, I caught it on a great night when everything came together as the creators must have envisioned it.  \n\nThis was a business dinner for four.  As such, I had to be less obvious about my intention to write a review with my dinner mates, and kept my mobile phone in my pocket except for when the Tiers of Taste I ordered arrived.  Three plates placed vertically before me on a stainless steel frame that was tall enough to block my view of the person across the table.  We all exclaimed delightful surprise and I felt justified in taking a photo of this unexpected presentation.  That was just the beginning. \n\nThe Decoy red from Buckthorn was a great pick by Tom.  I am not a wine expert, but my palate is sensitive enough to know when it is being seduced by gentle tanins. Gotta get me a case of that!  \n\nThe Marguerita Salad with Candied Walnuts, fresh Blue Cheese, and Tomato Vinaigrette was a cool sweet tart enjoyment.  My Tiers of Taste choices were Calamari with a Vinegar Pepper marinade/sauce, Pierogies and Stuffed Dates.  The squid was well fried, and the sauce was sweetly hot.  Pierogies with Onions and Sour Cream were softly pliant and offered a mild divergence from the stronger statement made by the calamari.  Finally, the Devils on Horseback (that's right), Chlorizo Stuffed into large Dates and Wrapped in Bacon, were a first that combined the luxurious flavor of excellent dates with finely ground Mexican Chorizo, girdled with well done Bacon.  I am not a bacon fan, but this was an exceptional experience.  It came together very well.  I was sated by this meal, and realized I had just come through a magic door that only a very extraordinary meal can open.  \n\nWinnie, Jeff and Tom all seemed quite satisfied, but because we were having a serious conversation while we ate, I could not bring myself to ask to taste their food.  But, the Crabcakes, Lemon Chicken and Berkshire Pork Tenderloin all disappeared with sounds of satisfaction.  As we walked out we all commented on the exceptionality of the dinner.  \n\nYardley Inn sits at the bottom of Afton Avenue, directly across River Road from the Delaware River.  It has suffered repeated flooding, and now has an inflatable berm that can hold off all but the most ravaging floods.  Sure hope it works, even when patrons cannot reach it without a boat.  It is a sterling restaurant when the stars align and reflect deeply off the flowing river. \n\nLast night I saw a constellation of 5 stars.",

    "text": "I stopped into Euro Delights while visiting the various tasting rooms around Skippack on the Winter Wine Fest on a sunny, but cold Saturday afternoon in January.  There was a vineyard sharing its wares in a back room, but with the people two and three deep waiting for a pour, I knew the better move was to take a comfortable seat at a small window table away from the crowd, and to order one of Euro's exceptionally delicious bakery gem.  \n\nI settled in, but decided to walk into the retail section of the old converted home to se what was under glass.  One of the owners/sisters remembered me from the earlier visit, and introduced me to her partner in the biz. After a nice chat about their success and desire to expand, I selected a square of Washington Cake and Coffee to be brought to my table.  \n\nThe cake was loaded with nicely spiced apples and a vanilla cake-like mix.  The texture was pleasantly chunky and mildly sweet with brown sugar and cinnamon accents.  The top was a Lemon Cr\u00e8me icing-one of my favorite flavors for pastry.  The overall impact was fun and totally satisfying.  I ate it as slowly as possible to stretch out my enjoyment. Luckily, the front dining room was not too crowded, and I did not feel rushed.  \n\nThis stop at Euro Delights confirmed what I experienced the first time.  This is a fine bakery and caf\u00e9 where the creativity of the baker and the warmth of the environment the proprietresses evoke mark Euro Delights as a one of a kind establishment where goodness translates directly to the taste buds.",

    "text": "Walking back through Skippack Village after Winetober Fest and a Brasserie 73 dinner, we came across a bakery caf\u00e9 looking place in another old house on the main drag.  I wanted coffee to accompany us back home, and approached the front door to have a better look through the windows.  I saw a display case full of attractive pastries and wanted a closer look and sniff. \n\nTurned out that Euro Delights is run by two sisters from Finland who have been here for many years, but still possess a delightful accent and a old world sense of comfort and taste.  The kitchen in the back is visible from the retail shop, and with the ovens just recently turned off for the evening, the aroma of cake and hot fruit and sugars wafted throughout.  Coffee alone would not be enough. \n\nWe shared a fresh miniature Apple Pie topped with Whipped Cream and a dusting of Cinnamon.  A personal pie scaled down to the size of a huge muffin.  Locally sourced ingredients made this an exceptional taste experience. The apple was sweet and surrounded by its juices. The brown sugar crumble on top was fun and firm to the bite.  The crust was excellent.  With the whipped cream adding a softness and subtle undertone, the entire desert was perfect.  \n\nWith the rage over cupcakes in full bloom, it was only a matter of time before a creative baker would take it to the next level - personal sized pies. Maybe this is already being done, but it is new for me. \n\nWe ate alone in the dining area across the center hall from the shop.  It was full of small tables, colorful walls and curtains.  It felt like we had stepped into a time capsule as the d\u00e9cor was mid-nineteenth century. \n\nDefinitely worth a drive to Skippack for Brunch and Pie, or one of the other tempting delights under the Euro sign.  Euro Design has only been open for 5 weeks, but their future is bright if they keep producing wonderful pies and cakes.",

    "text": "\"We're not authentic...But, we keep it real...\" \n\nAmen, Brothers!\n\nReal is what it is, and authentic is not required when the creativity and downright fun quotient is so high in what these dudes turn out.  \n\nWe showed up Saturday afternoon when the place was nearly deserted and took a table in the corner nearest the bar.  The place was sunny and as colorful as a Chinese carnival.  Cues of Asian influences abounded, but did not carry the final impression, which was far more idiosyncratic.  Our server fit her part perfectly.  She was alert, funny, cool and ready to engage.  \n\nWe were here for a quick stop before other errands.  We ordered only three small plates: Pork Soup Dumplings, Roast Pork Bao and Turnip Cake.  The Happy Buddha and Narragansett Beers were worthy companions.  Each dish was distinctive.  It suggested Chinese cuisine, while tasting quite different.  The Dumplings were tasty and fun.  Once the top knot was bitten off and the Miso Ramen Broth sucked out, the Ginger Vinegar was poured in through the vent, making the Pork Filling tart and a joy to eat.  It was a hybrid taste of slightly thick dumpling skin and Japanese infused innards.  Very nice. \n\nThe Roast Pork Bao was large and golden on top.  The consistency was right for a bun, but it also strongly suggested Kreplach to this Jewish palette. If my grandmother had been Chinese and Jewish, she might have created this masterwork.  It was like putting together a taste puzzle figuring out what this hollow doughball reminded of.  The Long Hots, Spinach and Provolone offered the possibility that someone's Italian aunt had a finger in this recipe.  \n\nFinally, the Turnip Cake was the biggest surprise.  It was made from Matzo Meal, Maple and Bonito, with a Fried Egg on top.  Again, my Polish/Jewish grandmother could not have done better.  It played with my tongue; teasing me to decide what it was all about.  It was delicious, but decided not Chinese.  \n\n\"...a Willing Mind and a Willing Stomach,\" \n\nYeah! You got that right.",

Calm Waters Coffee Roasters shows what dedication and imagination can do to turn around a main street in a struggling neighborhood. \n\nThe room is well renovated to feel about 1969, with exposed brick walls, sanded and polished narrow slat wood floors, and a tin panel-looking ceiling, that may not be authentic, but sure adds to the great ambiance here.  \n\nThe coffee is roasted right in the middle of the house and served hot, fresh and new.  Guatemala seems to be the source of the beans, and the owner's TLC in producing a quality product is obvious.  The taste of the java is bright and subtle, and a pleasure to drink.  I will bring a bag home the next time I stop in before court.  \n\nThey call themselves 'coffee roasters' for a reason.  That is what they are here to do.  Yet, they know people want to sit and enjoy their Cuppa Joe, and the room is well suited for a quiet conversation at one of the deuce tables.  Still, it is not yet a caf\u00e9 as the offered accompaniments are not as good as the coffee at this point.  There is no grill for breakfast or lunch plates.  They provide instead a few pre-packaged bakery things like muffins, and a decent microwave oatmeal that they will heat and serve. There is a Panini press that toasts and stripes one at a time. How much better Calm Waters will be when they are able to install a short order kitchen for early breakfast, late brunch and midday lunch.  \n\nRegardless of what the future holds, the present is impressive enough (in a quiet way) to warrant high praise.  \n\nIt has been too long since a Mill Street morning provided good reason to return.",

It took me by surprise that Warrington possessed what I enjoy most from a early day meal - old school charm, slightly worn yellow Formica counter, deeply involved husband and wife ownership with the former on the grill and later working the front of the house making customers feel like valued members of the family. And, let's not forget, exceptional food and warm friendly service.\n\nWe sat on a couple of spinners at the window end of the counter. Paige approached us with a bright smile, bobbed blond hair, and menus. She and the two other young women in black worked non-stop to keep up with the rush that seemed to follow us in and quickly filled up the booths, tables and stools. Luckily, we ordered ahead of the tidal wave, and received our platters in a few minutes. \n\nI went with a short stack of french toast covered in strawberries, bananas and blueberries (red, white & blue). A smear of butter and pour of syrup (maple?) and I was a happy guy. The taste of the egg/vanilla mix saturated the bread and was grilled to optimum; cooked through and through with caramelized edges. Loved it! \n\nOur other dish, Famished Farmer, was a special egg mix with potato, onion, ham and tomato, with a side of homefries; also solid and enjoyable. A black pepper shake or two brought up the flavor. We would ask for Tabasco next time to set it on fire. The homefries had great texture and taste. \n\nWe learned Bullard's offered dinner Thursday and Friday evenings. Meatloaf? Yes! Be seeing you again soon!",

Not only do you receive the benefits of excellent double fried cluckers in amazing sauces, but also the added bonus of being in a multiverse street fair community market that includes a brewery/pizza outlet, bakery, cafe, sushi shack, green grocer and butcher. So, you can cobble together the meal of your choice with ease without moving more than 100 feet in any direction, and dine in a common eating area shared by all. Delicious and impressive. \n\nMy 6 wing plate with sweet & spicy sauce took about 20 minutes to prepare. I was handed a buzzer to alert me when ready. In the meantime I secured a pint of pumpkin ale from Chestnut Hill Brewery as well as a seat at a long table with views overlooking an outdoor dining area. The place was crowded with folks doing more or less the same as me. When my buzzer started vibrating I asked the people next to me to watch my beer while I picked up the wings. They were happy to help me out. \n\nThe wings were on a beautiful rectangular ceramic plate on top of a tray. They glistened a dark red amber glow from the perfectly pitched sauce covering them. Three small pieces of celery and tiny cup of sour cream completed the meal. Exchanging the buzzer for the tray, I returned to my seat. The six wings were crunchy and meaty enough to sate me. The sauce was indeed both sweet and hot, and twisted my taste buds playfully. The cool, pungent ale was an excellent chaser, cutting through the heaviness of the sauce just enough to enjoy it again with each piece devoured. \n\nChiko Tako has both wings and half/whole cut up birds for sale, and they do primarily takeout from their stand in the market. The people there are friendly and efficient. They know they are a success, yet it has not gone to their heads. \n\nEspecially in combination with the other possibilities in the market, Chicko Tako is a great place for a street food snack.",

If it had, places like New Town Restaurant would be a roaring success spreading its Greek kitchen tentacles throughout the city like so many others who have become household names. Instead, New Town has scuffled along the past thirty years, one family turning out incredible breakfasts and lunches for those who live nearby or are fortunate enough to have found this hidden in plain sight tattered glory of a luncheonette. \n\nMaria and Peter (\"The best cook in Philadelphia.\"), are the front and back of the operation. She has the natural charm of your great aunt hostess, and he the stubbled smile and broad shoulders of a man who has been slinging hash for most of his life. The house looks like it was last renovated in the '90s, with Formica table tops and shiny plastic covered benches.\n\nBut, none of this would be worth imagining if the food exiting the kitchen wasn't equal to the narrative. Believe me, it is. \n\nOur breakfast exceeded expectations. My veggie omelet with added feta and home fries thrown in the 3 egg mix was homemade excellent, with rye toast and bottomless coffee for under $9. My partner in crime went with their lamb gyro sandwich with Maria's famous tzatziki sauce. It was among the best seasoned grilled lamb and white sauce I've tasted. With tip everything was $20. \n\nYes, New Town Restaurant lacks pizzazz, nor any sexy millennial attractions. Developers may even tear it down when the next wave comes through, which would be a crying shame. But, what it has is all it needs. 24/7 authenticity, owners who have lived their lives within its walls for a generation, and real food that just doesn't quit.",

You know, \"I'm from the City, so I know bagels...\" \n\nSorry, I was born and raised there myself (Washington Heights), and I've had some great bagels in all 5 boroughs, but also sampled pretty bad ones in all corners of the Apple; often in the same neighborhood. True, soft water from old wooden water mains helps, but nothing takes the place of a great recipe and patience. So, the truth is there are awesome bagels to be had almost everywhere the proper ingredients and skills are present. That includes just about anywhere in the Eastern USA, and any bakery close to sea level. \n\nSo, not sorry.\n\nThe Bagel Cafe in Delran, NJ, is but one example. It looks innocuous enough in a bland Rt.130 North shopping center in the middle of Burlington County. But, it would be a mistake to pass on it out of a mistaken assumption that nothing exceptional could come out of an oven there.\n\n Au contraire, Mon Frere. \n\nThat Onion Bagel overlain with Veggie Cream Cheese was a true delight. Its texture was perfect - firm crunch on the outside; airy light texture within. Mild sour flavor perhaps from the brief bath in boiling water with brine or lye to toughen its skin, yet not too much kneading to harden its tender heart. Piquant spread to pull the varied elements together. \n\nTrue, I think I detected a soft Russian accent from the women behind the counter. That would give them an edge in understanding the cultural imperatives of a true bagel, but whatever their secret, their creation had me imagining old country roots in the villages outside Kiev. \n\nOutstanding work, my friends!",

    "text": "Remarkable.\n\nSome Italian places are really just about pizza and sandwiches, with a nod to traditional dishes to attract people who want more than a couple of slices or a cheesesteak. Others, have talent in the kitchen, and can turn a beautiful platter, but don't really do assembly line tomato pie. It is much rarer to find a restaurant that does both very well while housed in a ordinary looking pizza parlor for the past 30 years. So it is with Paul's Penndel Pizza on old Route 1. \n\nThere was a steady line of pizza takeout orders on one side of the large room separated by half wall to create a cozy dining area on the other. Only two tables were occupied over here and the trifold menu didn't disclose all the hidden treasures possible in the kitchen. Photos on Yelp showed a good looking chicken francaise dish, but was it available? \n\nYes, it was! All I had to do was ask, and our attentive server Robyn made all the arrangements. \n\nIn addition to my request, we also chose chicken parmigiana and \"Shrimp Our Way,\" a penne platter with lots of shrimp and a delicious pink sauce. Each dinner came with choice of soup or salad, and double bread baskets. \n\nThe francaise was incredible. Butter lemon sauce and perfectly pan sauteed egged medallions. Tender, light and pleasantly tart. The best rendition I have enjoyed in many years. The Our Way was likewise exceptional, with knock out pink sauce over a dozen or more crustaceans and quality pasta. The parmigiana was a heavy load with spaghetti and copious red gravy. Substantial and tasty but a step down from the other meals. The side salads were large, but mostly iceberg, detracting from the other ingredients and house balsamic. Finally, the Italian loaves were the weakest link, with little crust, texture nor flavor. They really would do themselves a favor by finding a better bakery. \n\nThe shortcomings were not enough to seriously detract from what was otherwise a fantastic and surprising dinner. Still, had they been eliminated, this could have been one of the best meals of the year. As it was, it was damn close. \n\n4.5 STARS",

While they could all be more consistent, their overall product tends to be good to excellent, and their \"mission,\" highly worthy. So happens that the experience yesterday at this store was about the best I've had. \n\nThe place was almost empty at 3 in the afternoon. One or two tables occupied and a solitary customer at the register ordering a meal. We had plenty of attention from the friendly, dedicated staff. After ordering 8 oz of brisket for the spouse, I went with a combo of brisket, 2 ribs and sides of baked beans and Grandma's Mashed Sweet Potatoes.  Both came with a square of cornbread. \n\nAs you can see from the photos, the brisket was the blue ribbon winner. It was moist with plenty of dark brown bark. Both plain and wet it was a joy to eat. Great taste and texture. The ribs were pull off the bone tender and juicy, although not as dynamic as the beef this day. A shot of their Memphis sauce helped bring out the sleeping flavors. It was basically pulled pork without the effort of shredding. The beans were full of meat with a strong savory spicy base. Liked them a lot. The Grandma Sweets were over the top sugary, with a topping of melting brown sugar over already insulin inducing tawny tater. Not intended for diabetics, so be forewarned. \n\nAs we were finishing, the cashier who had originally seen us up front walked by with a whole tray of Freedom Fries for us to enjoy, on the house. Very generous gesture which we appreciated, but already stuffed, all we could do is take them home with the rest of the leftovers for later consumption. \n\nWe felt loved at Mission, and we reciprocated the affection for the staff and all first responders and military folk everywhere.",

As you go east toward the Delaware River, you come upon Ely Farm and its multigenerational pork products agribusiness on the left. Its long drive framed by white picket fence escorts you to the large barn processing facility, small retail store, and the old farmstead under aging trees. It is a quite the bucolic vista, worthy of photograph, or at least a deep breath of appreciation. \n\nWalking up to the shop we met several people waiting to pick up their freshly butchered deer. \"Eat what you kill,\" has immediate meaning, as we saw a couple carrying out a large flat box full of neatly wrapped meat and a plastic bag holding a multi point antler rack deer head for mounting. \n\nNot something you see every day.\n\nThe retail space is very small, with display cases showing many of their items for sale, access to walk-in refrigerators, and buzzing workers (mostly family) attending to the customers. It takes a few minutes for a first timer to figure out the process. We did, and ordered Seasoned Pork Chops, Hickory Smoked Kielbasa, Honey Bologna and Ground Beef. There was a lot more tempting us, but we had to start somewhere. Everything was made on site and looked great. \n\nWhen we got home we quickly sampled the kielbasa and bologna. Both had rich taste and we're slightly addicting. I fried up thin slices of the bologna and scrambled in a couple of eggs, salt and pepper. Delicious! Will grill the chops later this week. Can't wait. \nThey are lean cut with thin edges of fat. Nothing will go to waste.\n \nIf the seasoned pork chops are as tender and tasty as they look and the smoked meats have proven to be, we will become regular Ely customers.",

Already one of the most picturesque communities in greater Philadelphia, it has made itself a premier destination with the opening of the Market with the nano-brewery within. Now, it is possible to select from a broad variety of street food alternatives also housed within this adaptive reuse of an old warehouse, but also to wash it down with a decent beverage brewed on sight. They also have a pizza operation right there, with a Yelp deal that draws you a free pilsner with the purchase of one of their pies. These guys do everything right. \n\nMy choices: Korean Double Fried Chicken Wings from Chicko Tako and Pumpkin Ale from CHBC. Doesn't get much better than this! \n\nThe ale was rich with a nutmeg/allspice accent in a beautiful dark red amber liquid. Easy drinking, and a perfect washdown for the delicious wings with their crispy exterior under a thick gloopy sweet and spicy sauce. Cut through that like a hot knife through cool butter. \nThe brew tanks were visible to all, and the folks working the taps seemed to thoroughly enjoy their craft. At $6.50 a pint, it was hard to find anything to complain about. Even found a seat at a community table to enjoy my snack. \n\nKudos to Chestnut Hill Brewery for seeing the possibilities of producing and selling suds in this small market, and extra credit for the town council and mayor for letting it all happen to the betterment of the community. \nThe creative energy here was palpable and greatly appreciated.",

    "text": "There are many Mexican restaurants of the mom and pop variety throughout Montgomery and Bucks Counties specializing is home country cuisine primarily for their own compatriots who miss the wonderful flavors of home. Plates are loaded and prices tend to be low. In recent years a cultural crossover has emerged that offer similar dishes, perhaps somewhat less spicy that provide most if the flavor of Mexico, but for a more Norte Americano palate. Shops like El Limon have very successfully filled that space with folks who want something more authentic than Chipotle, but need English menus to participate in the experience.\n\nEl Sarape is a third kind of casa Mexicana. It brings an element of haute cuisine to the South of the Border Cocina, wrapped in a more high end atmosphere that transcends cultural bounds we are used to. This spacious house, with high ceilings, plenty of polished marble and dark stained wood, and brown ropes (cuerdos) hanging down from the rafters, calls for a reminder that an integral part of Mexican history was its involvement with Napoleon III, who was Emperor of the French Empire in the Eighteenth Century, where Mexico was its western outpost in America del Norte. The empire didn't survive, but its influence on Mexican food continues to this day. It involves excellent sauces, delicate recipes and Mexican looking dishes with French sounding names and haunting tastes. It is truly Mexican, but with a captivating twist. \n\nThis is where El Sarape stakes it claim, and it does an accurate rendition of this style of Mexican cooking. My Chile Relleno (stuffed pepper) was beautiful to behold in its sedate presentation. Neat, yet colorful. The same ingredients - poblano pepper, melted cheese, salsa verde, black beans and three tone rice - all on a white ceramic rectangular plate worthy of a more expensive restaurant. The flavor was full, yet more subtle than I've had in other places. The beans were moist without being dominated by lardiness often found in refried beans of all sorts. The rice was flaky, not clumpy. The twirled chip garnish atop the beans was a textural crispy counterpoint to the soft black semi mashed mound beneath. \n\nI was there for late lunch and wasn't thinking dinner. I sat at the bar and received excellent service from the bartender as he prepare for the evening crowd. I would certainly return for dinner if in the area, although the drive from Bucks approaches 45 minutes, which may be beyond my hunger tolerant distance. Prices are higher than at the other great tiendas, but recognizing the different experience that awaits makes it worthwhile.",

My trusty Yelp showed me Franco's Cafe was only about a quarter mile away up Cinnaminson Avenue. \n\nFound it, parked in their side lot, and walked in. \n\nFranco's is a Small Mexican casa, with half dozen tables, fairly standard menu and specials on a blackboard near the cashier. Daniella was my server. She was exceptionally friendly and said she was part of family ownership. Made sense, because she was totally engaged in keeping me in fresh brew coffee and whatever else I needed. As a first timer, I went with something basic - steak quesadilla. \n\nIt was excellent. Small strips of grilled beef, cheese and jalape\u00f1os, with small salad and sour cream, all crammed and flattened into a large tortilla cut in quarters. It was a healthy chew with just enough spice to keep my mouth fired up. The blackboard alerted to the presence of churros and ice cream as a special dessert. Love me some churros, and indulged. \n\nThey were hot, crisp and fresh; filled with a ring of caramel inside each fried strip of dough. Hot! So hot they deserved a warning, but the burn was extinguished by the Java accompaniment. Yup. Delicious, too! \n\nThere are full platter dinners available here, too. If you live in the area, it would be worth your effort to check them out along with their lunch and snack choices. \n\nFranco's is a casual and tasty 5 Star experience.",

It is a true mom & pop operation that specializes in fat hoagies and deli specials of the Eastern European variety. Prices are ridiculously low for 2021. So, if you're hungry and desiring a traditional stuffed sandwich, this is your huckleberry. \n\nI stopped in and walked to the back of the shop where a large refrigerated display case was full of smoke meats and tubes of salami, bologna, ham and trays of homemade salads and cultural delicacies like pierogi and stuffed cabbage. I ordered a chicken salad sub, with lettuce, tomato and hot peppers on a long roll, and watched as it was made, wrapped and bagged. With Snapple and Herr's Jalapeno Chips, the cost was under $10. That was a deal and a half, and I didn't have to pay for the ton of old world atmosphere that came with.  \n\nAs I waited, I looked around at all the accessories available. Awesome pound cakes, cookies, Cento pickles and sours, and a wall of cold drinks. Service was friendly, even for this stranger, and there were enough old-time regulars to make this place a hot stove center for local gossip. Very cool.\n\nThese neighborhood haunts remind of what America used to be when the first generations settled in and started life in the New World. Now, nearly a century later, they have generally aged well, although it has a hardscrabble feel to them with narrow streets, limited parking, and undersized stores and homes that are lovely, but feel somewhat dated. \n\nLucky for me, I love this sort of thing. It provides a getaway from the continual hassles of modern life and Covid anxiety. And, the sandwiches are great!",

    "text": "Found my way to El Chapin for lunch yesterday.  It is located toward the bottom of Cass Street in Trenton, between the prison and Arm & Hammer Field.  It is not really on Lamberton Street, although it is possible there was once a door on that side of the building. \n\n\"El Chapin,\" is slang for a Guatemalan, so although the menu has a certain Mexican flair, this is a house that specializes in cuisine from its southern neighbor.  And, it is very good.  The lady of the house was taking orders and cooking when I went in.  The menu is rather extensive and it took a while for me to decide what I wanted - everything was bilingually displayed with many photos.  Mamita was patient and when I finally selected the Chile Relleno she smiled and said it was one of the best dishes in the house. I bet she says that for whatever people want.  \n\nBut, she was right that it was special.  About ten minutes later, out came a large green Poblano Chili Pepper stuffed with spicy shredded Pork, Peas, Onion, Cheese, and a few things I could not define, all wrapped in a thin Egg Omelet.  Black Beans, Yellow Rice and a small Green Salad completed the platter.  It was delicioso. Every element of the dish could be tasted and the combination was a full pleasure to devour.  I also had a glass of Horchata, the Rice Milk and Cinnamon drink that is a national treasure.  As friend Marlyn describes, it tastes like liquid rice pudding.  When cold, I find it fun, tasty and thirst quenching.  \n\nAs with almost all the Latin shops in Trenton, they were once Italian joints or corner bars that had seen the neighborhoods change and adapt to the influx of new residents.  Unlike most, however, El Chapin has somehow removed the old rustiness of these places and made it feel fresh and energetic.  It was very comfortable to sit in one of its booths and watch people coming and going.  \n\nWhile I have favored all the Mexican, Guatemalan, Salvadoran and Puerto Rican restaurants that I have sampled to date, I found El Chapin to be about the best of the lot.  \n\nThanks for a great lunch, Mamita.",

This part of the region is dominated by the ancient flood plains of the Delaware. Driving through feels more like the Louisiana bayous than the Northeastern states. There is alot more water than dry land in these parts, with narrow spits of land for roads and a few homes surrounded by lakes, ponds, marshes and of course, the Mighty Delaware. \n\nThe folks around here have resided in this water world for generations. They are a tight community. When they want to socialize, Darby O'Gill's is where they meet to talk, drink, eat, play and inebriate. Yeah. It felt a little strange walking in for the first time with everyone looking up and following my steps to the square bar in search of a stool. But, my Eagles ballcap and 6'4\" smile gave me a pass for the moment, so they just stared and waited to see what happened. \n\nThe barkeep, Desiree, yanked me a pint of Yuengling Octoberfest, and asked to run my credit card before taking my food order. The lager was excellent. \n\n \"I don't know you, honey. Have to be sure you can handle this.\" \n\n\"No sweat. House rules are fine. Do what you gotta do.\" \n\nShe returned with a more relaxed countenance and handed my card back to me. The sound of conversation and football games on the TVs returned to the room. I ordered their Paddy Melt and sipped on the dark rusty ambered brew. \n\nThis joint was the diviest of taverns. Operated by Darby since 1998, and housed in a large building considerably older than that, it had been decades since it was cleaned thoroughly. The underflooring was exposed in many places and the knotty pine paneling was grease and beer splattered.\n\n Almost Heaven. West Virginia. \n\nThe grilled sandwich was pretty good with loads of sauteed onions and crunchy rye holding a half pound of burger and melted swiss. The ketchup was watery, but what the hey? It tasted good and was filling with a shovel of fries for an extra buck. \n\nI paid with a reasonable tip for Ms. D, and walked out into the cool bright late afternoon sunlight. The parking lot was as torn up as the barroom floor. There was a ragged trailer park out back that appeared to be in the same condition as everything else around there. \n\nAs I found my way out of this strange wet and desolate area, I was amazed that this place was part of contemporary Bucks County, and not a piece of land that time forgot.",

There is no Stella @ Stella's House Blend Cafe. \n\nBut, there is a Tiki (goddess) running the show, and she has the joint jumping. It was a capacity crowd at 10 am on Labor Day. The old 19th Century corner building in the heart of Sellersville, Pa, is as busy now as it ever was. The first floor occupied by this breakfast/lunch house has been brought back to life with TLC and a vision.  Have a good kitchen and they will come. They do, and they did.\n\nI found a seat at the counter between two big fellas, and felt a moment of guilt being alone and able to skip the queue waiting for tables. It didn't last long. From my perch the kitchen was visible, and I could watch to servers at work. Teamwork!\n\nMy French Toast with Strawberries and Blueberries was made from multigrain bread as they were out of Texas Toast by the time I arrived.  No problem.  Done right, FT pleases me in almost any form.  This rendition was very good.  I also asked for the real Maple Syrup, a $1.50 extra, because there is little point to eating great FT with run of the mill pancake syrup.  The Maple enhances, while the sweet corn syrup used by Log Cabin and the like, diminishes the flavor of the dish.  \n\nThe plate arrived loaded with bread and berries.  Gorgeous!  The side of Bacon I requested well done, was precisely that.  Firm, crunchy and with a splash of Maple, a delicious complement to the main.  Everything tasted very fresh, and their local sourcing policy seemed to be working well.  Same with the java.  Local roaster makes awesome joe.  Strong. Savory. A touch of milk to take the edge off.  \n\nStella's House Blend Caf\u00e9 would seem to be about the coffee, but that would deny the strength of the menu, and the skill in the kitchen.  Just about everything about this joint is fun and affirming.  \n\nHey, Tiki!  I really like what you've done with the place.  A wonderful place to end a beautiful September drive in the country.",

I watched as people filtered in and out.  No one seemed to be taking the space for granted.  The gold balloons didn't let that happen. \n\nI allowed myself a moment of pride and gratification for this city that has been down so long that Starbucks is a very big win. Let's hope it is the beginning of a renaissance that has been awaited since Washington surprised the Hessians on a cold Christmas morn.",

    "text": "There is a simple reason almost all the reviews for The Dutch on S. 4th Street are 5 Star. They deserve every star they get! \n\nI am not a regular part of the weekend breakfast/brunch scene in Philly, but given a reason to be in the Pennsport neighborhood early on a Saturday morning, I willing partake of this lovely cottage industry.  The small corner shop is bright and airy, even on an overcast day.  Pale and deeper blues offset the whitewashed walls, giving the feel of happiness and cleanliness.  There are two levels.  Dining room in the front of the house with around 10 small wood top tables, and a step up in the rear with a traditional counter and semi-open kitchen.  The owners are very hands on, supervising, serving, cashiering and hosting.  The \"Double Wilkum\" hex suits the personality of this place. \n\nWe walked in around 8:30 to a half full room.  We were shown to one of the small deuces toward the back of the dining area, and had a fresh large cup of java steaming my glasses in less than a minute.  The menu is short and sweet.  But, don't be misled by its list of offerings that look like any other hash house.  Hidden within the deceptively simply names are the creative energies of these \"Dutchmen.\"  \n\nMy Huevos Rancheros was not very South of the Border, but certainly tipped their sombrero in homage to the venerable dish.  Rather than tortillas, upon a base of Corn Meal Waffle were placed a shiny Sunny Side Up Egg, melted Cheese,  Fresh Tomato Salsa, Guacamole, Black Beans and well grilled and pressed thick cut Bacon; covered in mild Hollandaise.  Pretty as a picture on the plate, the assemblage had a great taste, if not overwhelmingly Mexi heat.  I never thought of corn and waffles in the same breath, but it worked like a charm.  It held all the component parts together, and sent the meal in an unexpected direction.  \n\nMy companion's Ham & Eggs with 3 Over Easys, interestingly delicious Hash Browns, and thick sliced Marble Rye, was devoured with little offered to me to taste.  I did manage a couple of sly bites when she went to the WC, and understood why she was not in a particularly sharing mood.  \n\nThis neighborhood is gentrifying, but still maintains its authentic South Philly personality.  On a less muggy day, sitting at the sidewalk tables would be a nice way to watch this part of the world go by.",

Brioche style buns held them together and offered sturdy handholds for the heft of the large slider. I realized the risk from bypassing their signature dishes, but why all the menu space for burgers? Why the interesting combinations? \n\nI had the answers when the large plate with Mighty Mike Burger was placed before me by the pleasant server in training. The roll top shined like it had been polished. The edge of the beef was thick, with a tip of bacon peaking out on top of melted swiss cheese. My request for medium finish was honored precisely. \n\nAnd it was a great Burger! Hot, drip juicy, flavorful. Russian dressing adding a sweet creamy note. A joyful surprise first bite to last. Beautiful pink at heart, and true to its credo of never having seen the inside of a freezer.\n\nBetter than Guys, Shack, Smash, Robin and many others with catchy names; at about half the price. \n\nHow do they keep this joint a secret?!",

Now that I am working downtown again this old joint is back on my lunch rotation. \n\nIt hadn't changed that much. Still a big room with many booths and counter service along a front wall. Still the standard Italian pizzeria with pies, calzones, hot & cold sandwiches, salads, pasta and platters. I ordered an eggplant parmesan sandy and picked my booth to await its preparation and delivery.\n\nIt was very, very good. \n\nLightly breaded thin slices of nightshade, slightly crisp outside and soft within. Enough melted mozza to promote textural integrity, but not too much to swallow the intended star of the show. Fresh, basil sweet chunky sauce dolloped on top, and all of it housed in a really good Italian roll.  It was a foot long; cut in half. So much for $6.95!  I needed knife and fork to go after the heart of the sandwich, and then ate half the delicious bread toward the end, almost like dessert. Crusty, warm and flavored with everything it had held in its once molten valley. \n\nSo assuring that Covello's hasn't missed a beat in all these years.",

Walking into this converted residential bungalow, I was overwhelmed by the floor to ceiling shelving packed with everything from vitamins to dry goods to frozen foods. The store has aged well, and has become as much a cultural museum, as a retail outlet designed to assist in maintaining health. \n\nWe stopped in to purchase more supplements that had run out at home. A clerk who worked there approached with a welcoming smile and showed us where what we sought was resting on the highest shelf in the house. She climbed a stepstool to reach them. They had a sale going on, and the price was very fair. We bought two. \n\nI loved the old wooden built-ins housing the drygoods, granolas and nut mixes. They would look great in our kitchen (alas). I could see how the claustrophobic might be challenged by the stuffed to the gills nature of this tiny store.

Apparently, when health consciousness is a priority, local sourcing predominates and the offerings change with the seasons, you have created a flexitarian restaurant. So, although its stainless steel & glass shell suggests a traditional Jersey diner experience awaits, in fact nothing could be further from the truth. This is a new age epicurian delight on par with the Turning Points of the world, without the pretense and only some of the accompanying cost. \n\nMy Country Griddle breakfast (scrambled eggs, onion, green pepper, morning sausage, mushroom, potato and 2 tone melted cheddar) in a large bowl with fresh biscuit on top, was delicious and filling. The coffee was hot and strong, with a small pitcher of cold milk provided at my request (may have been from Amish cows). From my perch at the counter I could see into the kitchen where the white hats seemed to be having a good time. \n\nEven if you don't know anything about flexitarian kitchens, you can find your way to a very pleasurable meal @ Silver Diner. \n\nNice going!",

    "text": "If mid 20th Century Archie & Veronica malt shops and Back to the Future big fin American road steel move your imagination, then Jem's Restaurant in East Norristown, PA, may be for you. \n\nWhat from the outside looks like another shopping center fast food luncheonette constrained by its surroundings to be a boring food dealer, is in fact a real trip down memory lane. The joint is a museum of cultural artifacts from the early days of television, with large posters of Rebel Without a Cause, James Dean, and Seven Year Itch, Marilyn Monroe. Perhaps that's why the room was full with retirees and people over the age of 70 (except for those of us needing to eat and run). This place is the original greasy spoon, for all the right reasons. \n\nThe double \"U\" counter separated the kitchen from the dining room. My spinner faced the grill operated by two short order cooks who worked smoothly in tandem. I ordered coffee and Jem's Scramble with feta and rye toast. The full insulated carafe of java set in front of me was a nice touch. I listened to the repartee between customers and servers. It was familiar and entertaining. Most everyone seemed to be a regular. \n\nI noted the pile of chunk cut red bliss potatoes and metal tray of bacon on the grill. I watched eggs, pancakes, french toast and breakfast sandwiches being cooked and constructed as spatulas flew. I also saw that the grill was not scaped clean between orders, allowing residue from everything grilled there to build up and become part of the next dish. No judgement. Then, my small Scramble arrived, steaming in my face and fogging my glasses. Smelled awesome and looked like a gently beckoning glistening syren. \n\nIt was delicious. The eggs held the sausage, onions, peppers and feta in a wet/warm embrace, allowing each forkful to hang together with all elements dancing on my tongue. There was also a hint of everything else that came before, making for a mysterious, yet very pleasant flavor. \n\nMaybe that is the house secret to success, or just how it accidentally became an amazing greasy spoon. Intentional or not, Jem's has a full house every morning, and is definitely doing something right.",

It is hard to find in Logan Square Shopping Center, but if you drive around back on the eastern side the rear door and sign are visible as the best way in. \n\nStarted 35 years ago by the same family running it now, the place has an easy Americana coziness and knotty pine charm that makes for a relaxing environment. The menu is similarly built on kitchen classics, with one side for morning victuals, and the reverse, lunch. I was the second customer when I walked in around 9:20. I liked the country vibe and took a table in the front corner under the windows and across from the cashier counter and kitchen entrance.\n\nTheir french toast was constructed from a thin cut croissant, and included fresh cool sweet butter to melt, real grade A dark maple syrup and two bacon slices. It was all very good, as was the bottomless coffee mug. Service was beautifully provided by Michelle, daughter of the owner/chef of the house. They both seemed to know all their customers, but me, and came out to greet everyone and catch up of the daily New Hope gossip.\n\nOne of the benefits of Logan Square is that it is not downtown in tourist centric New Hope.

    "text": "There is little doubt that Rocco's is the best restaurant currently in Newtown. This may change as there are new kitchens opening up almost weekly in the community, but right now, this steakhouse has it going on full bore. \n\nI had dinner there with son and his girlfriend the other night. We sat in the glass enclosed porch that rings the first floor. The space is beautifully appointed in colonial style, and white table cloths and heavy stainless flatware. It is a pleasure to walk through the barroom and dining room to reach the porch. From that perch the Newtown bustle can be witnessed first hand. We were there to celebrate several occasions that had gone  unrecognized over the past 16 months due to Covid. We had much to be thankful for. \n\nSon o'mine loves his steak, and his N.Y Strip done medium was beyond excellent in texture and robust flavor. He cut me a piece knowing that this was not my normal diet, but that I was open to experiencing superior dishes. Yes, it was amazing, and it was easy to understand his attraction. I had to concentrate to appreciate everything that was going on in my mouth as I chewed and savored. His girlfriend went with a medium filet. It wasn't as juicy as the strip by observation, but she was clearly loving every bite of her medium round thick slab of beef. \n\nI went with the French Onion Soup and Prime Burger, knowing my diet couldn't handle a platter of solid beef. The soup qualified for possible the best of breed in a lifetime. It was rich, savory, onions, hearty beef stock, topped with french loaf under a thick layer of gruyere, seared to a near-blackened finish either in the oven or by blowtorch. The cheese had to be pierced to access the molten potage below, and to permit the superheated steam to escape. It was epic, and nearly a meal by itself.  Stupendous! \n\nAfter all this, the burger was a bit of a disappointment. True, it was a combination of ground beef, short rib and brisket, topped with onion, tomato, lettuce and melted provolone, in a brioche bun. But, flavor-wise it was a situation where more is less. I didn't get off on the mix of beef. It just didn't taste like a high end burger. I like short rib and brisket at BBQ joints, but prefer them separately, where each of their distinct attributes can be appreciated, and not muddled together. So, it was disappointing after the star quality of everything else. The fries were standard crispers. \n\nSo, Rocco gets a less than perfect five stars here. Despite the burger, the rest of the experience was top notch, and the bar/dining area stunning In an understated way. On a less precipitous evening, eating outside would have been a legitimate option, but despite the umbrellas, we would have had to endure wet shoulders from the tropical storm brewing outside. \n\nNo wonder Rocco's is booked solid every night. It is truly a first class night on the town.",

    "text": "Five Guys makes the best grease burgers! \n\nGrilled on steel that is seldom cleaned during hours of operation, the beef sizzles until well done, when it is lifted off the heat and placed on a bun already prepared with whatever accessories you want. Whatever else they do to the body, they are incredibly tasty and provide excellent lubrication to the alimentary canal. \n\nIn addition, 5 Guys make great fries that far outclass their better known brothers. Their signature move is to toss extra fries in the brown paper bag after putting in the primary load carried in a paper cup. Excessive, but nicely so. Same goes for their shakes, which are also superior to the beef pucks. They are creamy, sweet cool ice cream splurges. Pricey, but the super caloric craving supercedes the doubtful overall nutritional value. \n\nSo, it is an upside down meal if you think about it, but certainly a ton of fun on a bun. \n\nUnbeknownst to me, I had ordered online from the Five Guys on Lincoln Highway, but not the road running through Bucks County, A/K/A Route 1, but rather the one in Lancaster, PA., over 100 miles away. My bad. I wrongly assumed that their locations were in order of proximity to where I lived. Not so on their app, so the reference to Lincoln Highway led me astray. You know, I saw what I expected to see (Langhorne rather than the actual Lancaster) and impulsively jumped the gun. \n\nThis is where Five Guys superhero Tyler stepped in to save the day. When the shop didn't have my order, he asked to see my phone and immediately knew what had happened. Not for the first time, he explained. He immediately reordered everything on the register and comped the charges, knowing I had already paid their sister store. They could correct this internally. \n\nTyler's superpower - being supercool and knowing exactly what to do without making me feel like a bigger smacked ass than I already did. All this coolness made the enjoyment of my \"special meal\" almost a secondary consideration. \n\nAlmost, but not quite, as it was digestible proof that some classy teenagers are ready to rule the world.",

As this is the older part of town, you can see 18rh and 19th Century buildings that remind of the pre and post revolutionary history of the area. \n\nThe menu has all the traditional dishes, some with a special flare away from what would be expected. For example, we ordered Calamari which came drizzled with a Thai Sweet Chili Sauce and Balsamic drip. All larger rings, it was a delicious surprise treat. Our Chicken Marsala and Francais were more classical, with two large breasts each atop Penne and wonderful reductions in Marsala Wine with fresh mushrooms and lightly dredged flour coat and  Lemon White Wine base, respectively. Tender enough to be cut with our forks. \n\nService was a bit slow, but not bad for a romantic Sunday night. We regretted not bringing our own bottle to this BYOB house. \n\nAside - All through the meal I had the feeling that this was a Roman room in the fine tradition of Trenton's Chambersburg neighborhood, which at one time had awesome Italian kitchens on every corner. They were classy and always full with locals manging to their hearts' content. Those days have turned to Spanish/Latino pleasures, but it's great to know that that Guilded Age can still be found if we look hard enough. In fact, the owners are from Trenton, and seemed pleasantly surprised to chat briefly about the old world, where I still have an office, and loads of memories.\n\nLa Strada is of that fine school.",

    "text": "Ota-Ya requires a bit of patience to find.  Sitting out back off Cambridge Lane in Newtown, it is easy to have never known that this place existed.  It is next door to Mamita's, the new Central American resto. If you don't know where that is, then you need to call ahead to speak with the very friendly owners who are accustomed to directing lost patrons.  \n\nIf you are familiar with the current state of Sushi/Japanese houses; this is not that.  It is an older space, without the front row knifemen flashing blades nor rice shapers. All that creative stuff is done in the back (kitchen).  What you see is the finished product brought to you by management or an on-the-ball server who knows everything about the menu, and will tell you what she/he thinks is de rigor for lunch or dinner.  The floor plan is rather small for a contemporary restaurant, reflecting that Ota-Ya has been slicing fish for a long time without the need for floorshows.  The aura is dark, the tables and chairs old, and the overall atmospherics close and subdued.  Whispering comes naturally.\n\nBut, in exchange for being the anti-Oishi in Ntown you get the best sushi.  Fresh, creative, aesthetic and self-assured.  If you love old Zato-Ichi movies, this is your place.  The blind swordsman sits quietly while the nasty Samurais' steel slice each other up defending their noble's honor. Finally, when the dominant villian and his henchman are about to kill the last innocent, Zato-Ichi excuses himself meekly, unsheathes his short sword, and dispatches the baddies while holding a baby in his free hand. \n\n \"...so sorry for the disturbance, young prince...\"\n\nHave whatever you want here.  It is all very good.  If raw fish is not for you, there is plenty of excellent Tempura, Teriyaki, Udon, Bentos, and Salads.  The owners are happy to chat with you if they have time, and if not crowded feel free to ask for a refill of the Green Tea and sit a while.",

    "text": "It is time to revisit my past reviews of House of Pho, and update my impressions and ranking for this ever improving Vietnamese restaurant.  \n\nReturning for the first time in a few months, the first thing I noticed was the presence of booths along the front windows.  We sat there, and the additional privacy was felt immediately.  Great touch!  They also had moved the drink menu onto a table card for immediate perusal and quick ordering.  Smart move to save the time of waiting for the arrival of the menu.  We selected the Mango Smoothy and Coconut Tuoi, and had them at the table within minutes, and before we ordered the victuals. The Smoothie was sweet and creamy, just as I remembered it, and the Tuoi was a mild coconut infused water with thin Coconut shavings in the glass.  Mildly sweet and instantly refreshing.  \n\nWe ordered the Spring Roll app, Grilled Shrimp with Lemongrass Sauce, and a small Pho Gai (Chicken).  The Spring Roll was cool, crisp and so fresh, with extra large Shrimp seen through the translucent skins.  The Peanut Sauce had a bit of a spicy kick and complemented the sweet crispness of the roll.  The Grilled Shrimp were smaller than in the Roll, but numerous, and arrived nestled in a lettuce leaf.  The Lemongrass Sauce was an interesting taste, less dominant that its Thai sibling, but well used with the shrimp.  It was subtle and I really appreciate the interplay with the light BBQness of the Shrimp. Finally, the soup was Pho-n-tastic; hot broth with large slivers of Chicken Breast and Noodles. The flavor was superb.  This is a clear broth as opposed to the sometimes tawny opaque smoky flavor offered by other pho joints.  Of course, it came with a side plate loaded with sprouts, basil leaves, jalapeno slices and wedge of lime. The bowl was so full when I finished preparing it I had to press down gently with my spoon to suppress the garnish and allow some soup into my spoon. A slightly bigger bowl with the same amount of ingredients might have been a good idea to avoid spillage. Totally satisfying.\n\nWe finished with VN Coffee and Green Tea, so we could sit for a while longer and talk while we continued to enjoy the evening created by House of Pho.\n\nThis establishment has become first class.  It need offer no apology to sister shops in nearby urban centers.  In fact, I recently returned from Garden Grove, California, the Vietnamese capital in the USA, where I sampled a few Vietnamese delights.  None were any better than House of Pho, and some were considerably worse. \n\n5 Stars to House of Pho.  Great work, Fred and Victor!\n\nOCTOBER 4, 2014 - The best places continue to evolve as they find their groove and have the courage to explore the outer limits.  House of Pho follows this tradition.  Their menu is broader as they are now offering special seafood dishes, no doubt putting a creative edge to a marketing survey to see where to go next. \n\n The house remains clean and coolly inviting.  The staff seems to finally feel comfortable with the kitchen genius, and Fred and Victor reign serenely over their domain. Today's Jackfruit Smoothie was so good ($1. off) and my Com Thit Nuong tasty and full of Pork, Noodles and Spouts.  While I went in for the Pho, the alternatives overcame me, and I went with something new for me.  \n\nStill a 5 Star experience.\n\nJANUARY 5, 2015 - Stopped in last night for a Pho dinner and decided to try the Spicy Hot Wings in their Signature Sauce.  They were hot, crisp, peppery, sweet, fat and delectable. A very good complement to the standard menu. \n\nKeep it up, guys!",

They were gone in under and hour.  \n\nEveryone wanted to know where they were from as they had not tasted such fresh, chewy, sweetly frosted doughnuts in an elephant's memory.  I only had a taste of two of them; the Blueberry and a Vanilla Frosted.  The former was mildly crisp on the outside, all fruit sweetness within.  The later had a fragile body, but a thickly poured sticky frosted coating.  Each was totally different than the other, as the frosted was soft with a delicious white coat, while the core was much like a well made glazed rounder that almost melts in your mouth.  The Blueberry was more cake-like, but totally infused with berryessence. \n\nMary's is located within the Bristol Amish Market on Green Lane, just off Rt. 13. This market is also worth a review, as it is large, bright and cleaner than the one I often visit in Newtown, Pa.  \n\nOnly open Thursday - Saturday with the rest of the vendors there.  On Thursday morning around 7:30 am, there were few people in the building, and almost no line at Mary's.  Go later in the day, and you risk them being out of one or more of your favorites.  The Saturday mayhem may not be worth the trip. \n\nI think I found its sweet spot.",

    "text": "Trejo Restaurant on Swede Street, just down a bit from the Montgomery County Courthouse, is a very good casa Mexicana in the heart of Norristown. It has about ten tables and a small kitchen in the back corner. The menu has a full monte of breakfast, lunch and dinner options. The people working there appear to be family and are likely ownership. They are friendly, hospitable and seem proud of their establishment. \n\nIt was late lunchtime, so a small Torta (sandwich) of thin sliced breaded beef caught my attention. When it arrived I knew that the adjective \"small\" was not really operative. This was a mega-sliced opus at least three inches thick, layered with beans, lettuce, avocado, tomato and spicy mayo, all held in a fresh roll with extra long toothpicks. The crisp fries were nice, but totally over the top unnecessary. \n\nThe torta was great. Too wide for my jaws to clench, I partially deconstructed it by removing a couple of layers of the tasty res empanada, and rebooting it to a manageable dimension. From there, every bite was a delicious combination of all the ingredients exploding in my mouth. At $10 I felt bad that I couldn't finish it. Still, it was one of the better authentic Mexican plates I have enjoyed in long while. \n\nThe good news is that my Norristown office is right down the street, so Trejo can become a regular stop when I am here for office meetings.",

Simple sign across the front steps, and small parking lot in back. There is barely room to turn around inside, but it is so well organized that it probably has everything you want for a solid take away breakfast and lunch.  The folks there are friendly and willing to chat while they do your bidding or take your cash. \n\nI stopped in for a quick caffeine jolt.  I wasn't hungry, but the aroma from the grill, and the sweet temptations from the muffin/donut display sure had my attention. Immediate mental note to come back with some room in the belly. The java was tasty and fresh, and the small cup a buck and a quarter.  Hard to beat.  \n\nRoebling itself is a cool former company steel town that has had its own boom and bust cycle.

    "text": "Good things can happen even in the middle of a snowstorm, and I survived to write about it. \n\nThe drive from Carlisle to Bucks was getting worse by the mile as snow and then sleet fell and made road conditions difficult.  With the speed limit reduced to 45 MPH, and my head beginning to pound, it was time for a break.  I was thinking comfort food, but when I drove into Malvern and my first choice (Pho) was closed on this Sunday, I found Dixie Picnic just around the corner, and seeing good Yelp reviews, I went in.  It might not be my normal comfy meal, but it certainly was someone's, and I was about to find out who's. \n\nThe space was bright and cheerful even on a dank dark afternoon.  I arrived around 1:30, and they were closing at 2.  No sweat.  The owner welcomed me and told me to sit and relax.  He handed me the menu after explaining the general lay of the land with breakfasts, sandwiches, BBQ, and Box Lunches.  Everything done in house and from scratch.  Home brewed Iced Tea, too.  \n\nI went with the Georgia BBQ Pork Sandwich on a fresh roll.  It came with a choice of a side dish - Pasta Pesto, thank you. While I waited, I listened to the oral history of this Southern family and the old photos on the walls took meaning and personality.  Lunch arrived.  \n\nA huge heaping load of heavily sauced shredded pork that required a fork to consume because to pick up the sandwich was to risk a major lap spill.  It was that BIG. The first bite had me sucking in my breath as the deeply sweet and tangy mix attacked my tongue and olfactory center.  WOW!  This was going to required time and patience as I adjusted to its wonderful flavor.  It had just the right amount of vinegar to provide a sharp retort to the molasses-like thick sweetness.  It was soft and tender and an easy chew.  I found myself enjoying it immensely.\n\nMeanwhile, the staff was beginning to close up, but I was assured that I could remain.  Good thing, because the other hot items were the Upcakes sitting seductively in the front display.  \n\nThese were upside down cupcakes covered on all sides in thick creamy icing.  The variety of flavors had their own menu and were seasonal.  Here, while the cake base was homemade and excellent, the real story was unabashedly the multicolored toppings.  I decided on the Blood Orange Icing on Devil's Food Cake.  \n\nThe icing was about a quarter inch think all around, save for the bottom (Actually, the top of this bottom's up creation). It was a soft cream, rather than a hard shell, and gave itself up freely.  While sweet, it was not overly so, and settled nicely on the tongue for a lasting taste sensation.  The chocolate cake was super moist and almost gooey.  I loved it. \n\nWhoever thought this one up deserves a place in the Cupcake Hall of Fame.  \n\nThanks to everyone associated with Dixie Picnic over the generations for your love of cooking and taking care of people.  \n\nYou all certainly took great care of me, and introduced me to new possibilities in comfort food. \n\nGratitude and respect.",

    "text": "Philadelphia is known as a city of neighborhoods with good reason. There are many small enclaves with their own identity and distinct character with residents fiercely proud of where they come from. One of the best aspects of this street by street, hood by hood, awareness, especially from a Yelp perspective, is the presence of wonderful local shops, bars, and restaurants that maintain that sense of community every day of the week.  \n\nTate's Good Food Restaurant on Torresdale Avenue, in this corner of the city that shares the name, is one such iconic luncheonette that serves both the gastronomic needs of the area, and supports the people with quality breakfasts and lunches and a place to gather and commune together (shoot the sh*t). It is replete with folks who have lived nearby for generations, and frequent this small institution regularly.  Yes. Everyone knows your name. \n\nWith this in mind, I stopped in for breakfast and took in the deep rooted atmosphere of this iconic establishment. I sat on a spinner along the counter, after checking out the tables on the opposite wall. A solo diner, I did not want to take up that much space, and after all, this was what a stool was for. Within seconds, I was called, \"Babe,\" by one of the servers working the counter and floor, and, \"Sweetie,\" by another, as she asked if I wanted coffee.  \n\nShe replied when I asked if she was talking to me - \"Whatever works, right, Babe?\" \n\"That's cool. I just didn't want the other guys at the counter to get jealous.\"  \nWith that, one of those old dudes looked over at me with a stern gaze, and retorted, \"She WAS talking to me, but, I don't mind if you thought it was you.\" \n\nWink\n\n I knew I was in the heart of Philly. \n\nThe menu was all about breakfast and lunch (they close around 2).  I went with the french toast, a side of corned beef hash and java. It arrived about 10 minutes later on an oval plate, with the hash on a second dish. I moved things around to get everything onto one before doctoring with butter and syrup.  \n\nThe meal was filling and satisfying. Six slices well egged and grilled. No real caramelization, but very tasty nonetheless. The hash was excellent. Deep savory flavor, a little crunchy. A great match for the sweeter fry bread.  The Bunn-O-Matic brewed a strong industrial joe which was replenished as often as requested. A small glass of real milk per my wish to avoid the heavier half & half. \n\nTate's is another of those classic kitchens from a bygone era that have survived and even flourished.  It is as authentic today as it was in the last century.  It feels dated, but that is one of the two main reasons to come to a joint like this - For the wholesome hearty grub and to experience a living cultural museum.",

In the wilds of Delran (Delaware & Rancocas River/Creek merger nearby), this slophouse has been slinging hash and over-easy eggs, since your great grandfather was a youngun', and rode his bike with his buddies over for a greasy burger and fries.  There is a small counter for solo travelers like me, and a bunch of booths and tables for those who come with.  If this joint was any more authentic New Jersey, it would be one of Washington's stops during the Revolution in West Jersey. \n\nThe place has a timeless quality.  Although well maintained, it feels its age, and the life stories of all who have dined here over the decades.  It is totally country in a cool, off the beaten path, Jersey way.  From my perch at the counter, I was on top of the grill, and watched as the cooks cracked their eggs on it, poured pancake batter, and dropped their presses on the bacon and burgers.  More important to me, I watched my short stack of French Toast go from bread bag to egg mix bowl to grill, with care and expertise. I saw it plated and brought to me by the short order dude, with small cup of butter, and counter rocket of syrup.  \n\nWhen spread, melted and squirted, my breakfast looked great, and was caramelized on its edges, just the way I like.  The java was hot and free flowing, and the \"honeys, and \"dears,\" from the hard working server made me feel at home and appreciated. \n\nBetween this place and Grannies' Attic Caf\u00e9 up the way, I have stumbled on two exceptional breakfast joints that both garnered 5 stars for just being awesome interesting tasty spots to stop for the first meal of the day.  \n\nAnd, they are both New Jersey thoroughbreds.",

Without a critical mass of Central Americans nor Mexicans in the area, the kitchen knows they are cooking primarily for gringos, and not their countrymen. They keep the joint clean, are bilingual, and pay close attention to the spice tolerances of their customers. They also have adapted the new policy of skipping the chips & salsa as a complementary snack while you wait for your ordered dishes. If you want those crunchies and sauces, you are going to have to order them, and add it to your bill. \n\nNo problem. I don't need those extra calories, anyhow. \n\nI ordered beef flautas and fresh guava drink. They were both excellent. The flutes were oven-crunchy and full of well grilled and shredded beef, spices and cheese. The more I chewed, the more the flavor enhanced my palate. Delicious, with lettuce, onion and white cheese drizzled on top. The guava was cool and refreshing. Reminds me of apple juice, but more sweetness, and a hint of sour behind the bright sugar rush. \n\nService was friendly and personable. Prices reasonable, coming in at just about $10 for my dinner, before tip. The room is a traditional colorful rendition of the restaurants found in the home countries.

The casa recently opened and is totally renovated from the former occupant.  It is new from top to bottom.  The space is light and airy with a north facing wall of windows onto Dayton Street, and comfortable furniture and excellent service.  \n\nI stopped in for breakfast after court today to check it out.  I was given a paper menu and invited to sit anywhere.  I took a table toward the rear where I could see everything that was going on.  I went with strong Columbian coffee, and the La Cabana Omelet, which arrived stuffed with chorizo, peppers, cheese, onion, potato and topped with fresh pico de gallo.  There was also a basket of fresh sesame seeded bread and butter provided.  \n\nThe meal was excellent.  Loved the egg dish.  It was steaming hot and melded together into a delectable hot mess.  Definitely a three egger. A few dashes of Tobasco and I was in business. The side of home fries were tender and nicely spiced, and really more than I could finish.  Nicholas stopped by several times to inquire as to my need for more coffee, and promptly took away the finished plates, while inviting me to remain as long as I wished.  Nice touch, as I was in no rush to leave this mellow, sunny place.  \n\nI was lucky enough to meet the new owner, who was in a business meeting at a nearby table.

If she maintains this level of quality and professionalism, it is all but assured. \n\nPS. Just a hint - Consider turning down the volume on the TV if no one appears to be watching it.

Also, fantastic.  \n\nI was full, but not stuffed, when we finished eating.  We shared a piece of apple cake ($3.00).

Because since the passing of the dearly departed Ratner's in Manhattan, Junior's is left to carry the cheesecake torch.  It is super rich, creamy, sweet, and succulent.  It comes in a variety of flavors and sizes.  The wait for a table in any of their locations is legendary.  \n\nBut, now, there is no wait at all if you come to their factory and outlet store in Burlington, NJ.  You can walk around and see what they have available, and walk out with a stack of sweet heaven.  The prices start at only $2 for a 6 inch plain cake.  That is sinfully glorious, because money ceases to be an object in the decision to buy.  There is no splurge at that price.  \n\nNothing this good comes without a small reservation.  It is irrelevant to many, but the cakes in the outlet are slightly \"irregular.\"  Some are lopsided; others have settlement cracks; a few have uneven swirls of strawberry or raspberry mixed in.  All these are rejected by quality control for the New York sites, but as a result, you can have a full cake here for less than the price of a single slice in the City.  \n\nTrue. Self control becomes an issue when something this decadent is available in large quantities, variations, and at impossibly cheap prices.  The addicts were lined up outside the door waiting for it to open.  They all made a beeline to the free samples and stuffed face until all the small paper cups were gone.  While they were buzzing there, I found the Raspberry Swirl 8 incher I was looking for, and made for the cashier.  That baby went for $11, and will feed my family for more than a week on rations.\n\nThe anticipation of that first smooth creamy bite sends shivers up my spine. \n\nWho's the addict?",

First sip alerted my tongue that a strong brew was on the way. By the time I was ready to depart, the caffeine had reached the brain, and I felt the welcome surge of focus and energy that only the freshest darker roast can provide. \n\nExactly what I needed. \n\nPrices are reasonable for a custom roast/brew operation, at $2.25 for a regular cup; slightly more for extra volume. There were a few folks working at the tables while I was there, thus no shortage of seats for those who wanted to sit and sip at this time of day. \n\nRichboro Coffee joins other recently opened coffee houses in the area.  The coffee competes quite well with that from Newtown's Coffee Room and Yardley's Pretty Bird Caf\u00e9.  Each contributes in their own way to the upgrade of caffeine alternatives in the region, with Richboro seemingly with the best coffee, Newtown with the most comfort, and Yardley with the most variety on the menu. Fond of all of them.\n\nRefills are a buck.",

There were only a few customers, and the staff was beginning to clean up.  I read the ordering directions a safe distance from the window, decided what I wanted and walked up to the young guy in the Steve T shirt and ballcap. The Cheesesteak wit Onions, Provolone and Roasted Peppers came out on the thin sheet of Steve paper.  When I attempted to pick it up with one hand I felt the heft of the sandwich and quickly put my other hand underneath to keep it from sliding off onto the floor. It was that heavy.  It was a work of art.  The peppers, onion and cheese glistened under the lights.  A small pool of oil began to collect once I placed it on the small stainless steel counter than runs around the shop. \n\nI went back to the fixin's bar to get some Banana Peppers to add more heat.  I sat down on the bar stool and looked at this creation.  I took a photo to commemorate the moment.  I really thought there was no way I could eat the whole thing. Then I took the first bite...\n\nHeaven. I'm in Heaven...Yes, the song danced in my head.  The roll was lightly crusted and extremely fresh.  Great taste in its own right.  The blending of the ingredients on chewing was an intense explosive release of flavors, textures, spice and heat.  I lost all control.  I couldn't hold back.  I had an orgasm in my mouth before the second bite.  The sweetness of the onions soothed the heat from the peppers, but did not overcome them.  The provolone provided a subtle undertone that played well with the roll and sliced beef.  My eyes rolled into the back of my head and when they returned, the sandwich was completely ingested.  \n\nThe only thing I can say is, when can I go back for another? \n\nSuggestions:\n1. Cash only. There is an ATM inside the shop, but why pay the extra charge?\n2. To keep cost down, go with the Cheesesteak with American or Wiz, as the other cheeses are extra. \n3. Try the pepper fixin's bar before ordering extra peppers at the window.  There are plenty of choices there, and it is another buck or so to have them cooked with the steak.  \n4. The fries are very good. If you care at all about your heart, try them straight, w/o the extra cheese.  It looks great all melted over the fries, but when it cools it is just a coagulated yellow mess.  That is how your heart sees it. \n5. Don't wait another day to have one.",

Whether studying or being contemplative, such atmosphere tends to bring to best out in us. So it is with Shot Tower Coffee.\n\nSitting on the southeast corner of S. 5th & Christian, the large plate glass windows filter the afternoon light into a mellow golden glow that quickly transforms the small room into a spiritual center whose ambiance is palpable. No wonder people come and hope to stay as long as possible; sometimes on their laptops, and often is simple chats or just meditating as they mindlessly stare out the windows to the street life on the other side of this gossamer screen. \n\nNot to mention that the bean life is also excellent, with friendly service folk who engage so well with customers. \n\nMy chai latte was a large glass mug of well designed and prepared tea and milk that had great mellow taste and aroma. Likewise, the vanilla latte was bright with subtle vanilla flavor, and only needed a short shake of brownulated sugar to climb to the proper sweetness.  A sucker for lemon bars, theirs was wonderfully tart with crunchy base.  Loved it! \n\nWhy is it called, \"Shot Tower?\"  Damned if I know, with its double meaning.  I'll leave that to the coffee historians.  All I know is that I'm glad to have finally stopped in and realized the pleasure of its charismatic grace.",

    "text": "Tikal Restaurant & Lounge is the successor to the venerable Rossi's Bar at the corner of Morris and Franklin in the Chambersburg section of Trenton, NJ.  At one time, Rossi's was considered to grill the best burgers in the city. When they moved out to Quakerbridge Road in Hamilton, there was a big void left behind.  \n\nThat emptiness has now been replaced with this well appointed  casa Guatemalteca. I stopped by for lunch recently and was impressed with the quality of the finished space.  The old square bar had been replaced with a wall unit with attractive wooden back bar.  There was new furniture in the barroom as well as the rear dining room.  New windows on the world were stenciled with the new name and its Mayan pyramid logo. Tikal is a famous historic site in northern Guatemala where the Mayan Civilization build a large city and temple complex before the arrival of Europeans, or even the Chinese before them.  \n\nThe menu is a bit of a fusion exercise, with a large national delicacies list, and a few Americano dishes like hamburgers and cheesesteaks with a definite Central American flair.  They also blend up excellent shakes and fresh fruit bedidas, using your choice of water or milk base.  I took a stool on a hightop in the barroom, and was served by bartender, Ana.  She had the right temperament for the job, and was friendly and prompt with menu, order taking and food delivery.  She was also patient as I worked my way through the menu looking for the right combination for lunch. She finally recommended the Tikal Wrap, with came with papas fritas.  I also ordered a mango smoothie as a washdown.  \n\nThe drink arrived in a tall frosted glass.  The mango mix with water was cool, semi-sweet, tasty and very refreshing.  The wrap was a monster, full of grilled chicken, lettuce, black beans, avocado, tomato and an interesting piquant sauce. I ate as much as I could, knowing that I would be skipping dinner that night.  It was excellent. The ample pile of fries was more than I could handle, but they tasted great with the spicy mayo that came in a bottle rocket on request. The app chips and homemade salsa were overkill, but I did dip a couple of the triangular chips, and thought the salsa nicely spiced. \n\nTikal is one of the higher end Guatemalan houses in the Trenton area, and definitely worth a visit for lunch or dinner.  Prices are very reasonable.  I am particularly curious about their burgers, given the gloried history of the joint.  As I am not a fan of the new Rossi's, it would be ironic and poetic justice if the new Latin take on this American classic was better than the \"new\" original.  \n\nSometimes the city is the secret sauce that make for magical dishes.",

    "text": "We ordered the Soy and Sweet Chili Wings, as well as an attractive plate of Kimbap on a late Sunday afternoon in September. \n\nThe house was dressed up in red and black lacquer, and KPOP blasted from the audio system.  Service was spotless.  We had the side room to ourselves.  So, while Soho may be SRO by night, if you want the great food without all the hustle, hassle and wait, try earlier in the day. \n\nFrom the look of most reviews, everyone already knows how awesome the Korean Fried Chicken (KFC) wings are. Double fried, and heavily dipped and basted, they arrive plump, crisp, loaded with flavor and plenty of juicy meat.  At a buck a wing, you are paying more than in the standard Buffalo wing joints, but there is really no comparison to the quality of the experience.  I was blown away. \n\nThe Kimbap looked like sushi roll, but my server was adamant that they were very different.  Very good in their own right, but to my untrained palate, they were quite similar.  \n\nCaf\u00e9 Soho is on Cheltenham Avenue, in the town by that name.  It is not the most convenient place to transport to, except for the locals who discovered it years ago.  It is 30 minutes from mi casa in Bucks County, and likely even farther from Center City, Philly.  The travel adds to the excitement, so when it is finally seen on the near horizon, the heart quickens, and the saliva flows, in anticipation.  Walking in is entry to an alternate Korean universe.  Don't worry. Everyone is bilingual and very friendly.  The music is cool and hot (like the wings), but loud enough to interfere at times with conversation and appetite. \n\nDon't let that stop you.  The Wings are the Thing!",

It all looks fantastic, and the samples at the counter make certain you try enough to bring you back for more. \n\nThe one downside is the expense of self indulgence. The bonbons are $2.50 apiece, so a medium size box assortment hits $30 before you can take a breath. You really have to love someone (or yourself) to make that commitment. Well, I did and I do, so I won't be too disappointed in myself. \n\nYes, my friends were duly impressed. The little balls of intense flavor wrapped in excessive opulent cacao were all that. With a good red wine chaser it was a near orgasmic experience. I watched as they bit their first bonbon and began to chew. Their eyes rolled to the back of their heads and a involuntary gasp escaped their lips. \n\nNo doubt the best way to enjoy these delights from Naked Chocolate is to be naked yourself with someone you love. \n\nSoon.",

    "text": "China Gourmet is a very pleasant surprise if you, like me, love a traditional dim sum Chinese brunch every once and a while. \n\nSituated on St. Vincent Street in Northeast Philly between Brous Avenue and Roosevelt Boulevard in Mayfair, it is a large house in a developing Asian neighborhood that puts out trolley carts loaded with small dish treats both savory and sweet, at reasonable prices and with the expected hussle and flow that this dining style uniquely delivers. Admittedly, the aggressive nature of the cart ladies hawking their delicacies takes some getting used to. You have to be able to say \"no\" when you feel overwhelmed by the surrounding din. But, know that slowing down the onslaught is proper, and multiple opportunities will present themselves. Just take what you want in the moment and let the trolley women return when you are ready for more. \n\nThe most important thing at China Gourmet is that they know from dim sum. There are dozens of choices and most of them are good to great. Shrimp and pork shumai, shrimp hargow, beef rice rolls w vinegar, fried stuffed buns, various dumplings, fish filled chili peppers, egg tarts and many others are well prepared and served hot or cold as appropriate. My bowl of congee was also decent with plenty of ground pork and fresh cut scallion on top. There is plenty more, but you get the picture. \n\nWhat's even better is the availability of FREE PARKING right in front of the restaurant, and the large Asian supermarket and Vietnamese kitchen right next door. The money saved is like getting a 25% discount off your check! Hard to beat! \n\nNow that we've experienced the fun and convenience of a strong dim sum morning with grocery shopping for dessert, Chinatown has lost some of its cultural luster for us (not completely). \n\nGotta love it!",

    "text": "It was the Red Door in the middle of the building that I wanted, but it took three tries to discover it.  \n\nThe whole layout was confusing.  First, I walked into Levittown Lanes, the near-historic bowling alley at the east end.  I didn't want to bowl, but in my mind, the bar and bowling were in the same space, making for a lot of potential fun.  But, the man at the shoe counter, perhaps not understanding what I was looking for, sent me outside and to the last door on the right.  What did I know? \n\nI went into this plain wooden door without much of a sign, and found myself in a tiny dining area full of restaurant supplies and no customers.  To the right was the small takeout area with high half wall protecting the cashier and pizza ovens.  Ok. I ordered a Chicken Cheesesteak and inquired where the BAR was.  I was again sent outside and advised to take a left and enter the next door I came to.  Would my sandwich find me?  Sure. No problem.  \n\nI followed directions, and finally entered the actual barroom.  It was of the dive bar genre.  Dim, smoky, rock & rolly, and full of fatigued workers who where here for a few brews on their way home after another tough day.  Def my kind of place.  I bellied up to see what the back bar looked like, and met Angela, the mistress of ceremonies and bartender fatale.  I explained the strange circumstance that brought me to her lair.  She laughed and said that I must really need a cold one.  The Pabst Blue Ribbon pint was $2 all night.  Solid unpretentious American suds, just like the Band Box.  \n\nIt went down so smooth and cool and tasted so comforting.  The guys around the bar accepted me as they saw the pint pour down my gullet without more than a swallow.  Thank you, Milwaukee.  They confirmed that I had found the best bar in Levittown - best food; best drinks; best prices. The Steak Sandy found me a few minutes later.  \n\nIt was large, with a cut transecting the midline.  The bread was nicely toasted and crisp.  It had a good yeasty flavor all by itself.  The shredded and grilled Chicken was mixed with Onion and Mushrooms, with American Cheese holding the innards together.  It was hot, steamy and delicious.  A squirt of Ketchup and I was in business.  Maybe it was the combination of Pabst, people and the deft touch of the kitchen hands, but that was the most enjoyable cheesesteak I had eaten in a long time (at least since my last visit to Steve's).  \n\nAngela and I exchanged a few bar stories before I left.  Seemed we might know some of the same people in the biz.  I drove away thinking that of all the cool and curious old taverns in this part of the world, Band Box might be the best of breed.  \n\nNext week. Same time. Same stool.",

The atmosphere is urban casual, with wood upholstered furniture, step up side dining room, and lots of local artwork for sale on the walls. The menu is fairly traditional American fare. Breakfast and lunch are the focus. \n\nDuring the week there is ample street parking, although it may be necessary to walk a block or two. There is a small storm room entry at the corner front door, but once inside the full effect of this turn of the twentieth century retail space takes effect. It could just as easily be 1930 and 2018. I love that kind of time warping. \n\nService is offered by friendly neighborhood women, who move efficiently through the shop loaded with coffee mugs, and large breakfast plates. The java was strong and refilled as needed. My request for milk rather than creamer was met with a small stainless pitcher of cow juice. My short stack french toast was well saturated with egg, vanilla and cinnamon mix and grilled up with a good caramelized surface. Tasted so good with melted butter and lots of syrup. \n\nThe combination of old city streets, repurposed space and quality food made for a strong morning impression. Could have hung out a while longer with another mugga joe, but an appointment back in the 21st century beckoned. Still, Hinge Cafe is another of those exceptional cafes, luncheonettes, and pocket restaurants that make these historic hoods so interesting and worthy of repeat visits.",

The taste was excellent with the three main ingredients able to project their flavors without the messy overlap of too many things going on to confuse the tastebuds.

Those of you familiar, already know that it is a high volume higher quality Italian hoagie gold mine that creates stuffed sandwiches loaded with Dietz & Watson meats and cheeses, and a few signature pieces. Those of us who haven't been there before yesterday now know that this place is a legendary Philly landmark (30 years in this location) that turns out among the best Sammies in the city. \n\nI stopped in after a heavy afternoon of food shopping next door, and ordered two \"small\" 12\" torpedos with Rare Roast Beef & Provolone and Roast Turkey & Swiss, both dressed with lettuce, tomato, mayo, oregano, hot & sweet peppers. Both To Go. \n\nWeighing in at about one pound each, we tore into the roast beef on the drive home. It was spectacular! The meat was fresh and tender, the provolone mildly tart and dry, that combined with all the accessories for a dynamic and delicious bite and chew. The best way to attack this zoftig big boy was with two hands and aggressive squeeze and stuff into the mouth, just like with a cheesesteak. We tag teamed it, my partner holding it in front of my face, while I grabbed with one hand and directed it into my mouth. It only worked at stoplights, but a couple of large bites did the trick. No fuss, no muss. Only a sesame seed from the roll jumping off the bread onto my lap before slipping to the floor. \n\nThe Turkey & Swiss was just as good. Top flight ingredients and delightful eye opening taste. Both were good for two meals apiece, so we finished them later that evening with good brew and jalape\u00f1o chips. \n\nMarinucci's is one of those Philly joints that leave a lasting impression and a strong desire to return whenever in the neighborhood, which fortunately is about once a month. \n\nThe corner of Brous and St. Vincent is a true destination for everyone seeking variety in their low budget culinary exploits. Vietnamese, Chinese, Boba and Marinucci's all in one square of Mayfair is a foodie's dream come true.",

Plenty of cheese wheels, dried sausage, breads, sweets and takeout meals for the asking; all in a small shop that smells as great as it looks. \n\nI was there to grab a sandwich for lunch. They have a long list of choices that can be wrapped, rolled or sliced-breaded. I went with their turkey BLT on a 12\" crusty roll. It was huge. Stuffed with enough ingredients for two meals and smeared with aoili mayo that pulled the various tastes and textures together. The roll was excellent, with hard crusty exterior and well aerated sourdough flavor within. Definitely, best of breed master baker. Chomp and chew required strong jaw and teeth, and boy was it a worthwhile challenge. \n\nIt was a great sandwich experience. \n\nAte half, and rewrapped the remainder for later consumption (son devoured it as soon as I got home). $10 for two meals makes the price very reasonable. \n\nIn a land full of mediocre pizza shops, it is so nice to have another vision of Italian cuisine so well represented.",

    "text": "If you can't get to DiBruno's in South Philly, you should give La Stalla Italian Market a visit for your Italian delicatessen and specialty requirements.  While not packing the huge inventory of cheeses, smoked meats, salads, and bakery goods of its distant cousin to the south, the Newtown store sure is a reasonable facsimile.  This new place looks and smells like 9th Street, and goes overboard when asked to create a sandwich or other takeaway meal.  \n\nTheir loaves are about the best Italian bread you can find anywhere in the area.  Certainly as good as Italian Peoples' Bakery and the dearly departed Barbero's in Chambersburg, Trenton, NJ.  It is so excellent that it can easily be enjoyed without anything more, or a little olive oil with black pepper, or a smear of butter.  But, if an incredible lunch is what you desire, just pick a few of your favorite sandwich ingredients, the size roll your want, and let the deli folk go to work.  You will receive an immense tower of wonderful meats, cheeses and accessories that will last at least two meals. If you prefer not to create your own combo, just select one of their house sammies.  You won't be disappointed. \n\nNewtown has been undergoing a renaissance for the past several years, with improved restaurants and boutiques merchandising everything from designer clothing, great smoothies, to tasty tidbits. La Stalla Italian Market joins the fun and is built to scratch that impossible culinary itch. \n\nParking in the rear and on the street nearby.",

There really isn't. I've had great ones on the Westside, and crappy ones in Soho. I've bitten into rock hard dense losers in Canarsie, and lovely light crunchers in Elmwood. \n\nSo, don't listen to anyone who says they know what's best for anyone but themselves.

    "text": "Past time for an updated review to reflect all the positive changes that this bagel emporium has gone through over the last few years. \n\nBiggest visible change was the expansion of their footprint and reorientation of the shop to permit side of building access which greatly enhances the size and feel of the space. Now Keystone is a for real cafe, with table and wall seating all around which gives a spaciousness to the operation.\n\nMost important, they have built a bagel bakery right into the shop, with windows allowing customers to see the bagelmeisters at work. Not having to transport them from a more distant location means that the bagels are apex quality right from the oven to the bins. Nothing is lost in taste nor texture when the overall distance is about 20 feet. The difference in chewability is immediately apparent. Crisp firm outer skin and soft tender inner bagel, and full load of toppings (onion flakes for me), that stay affixed to the rounder, and don't fall off with normal handling. \n\nService was excellent all around, with ordering at the counter and delivery to the table when done. Take out seemed just as smooth as I watched people come and go quickly. \n\nKeystone is planning an expansion into other shops and considering franchising the business. From what I saw and experienced on my last visit, they have a thoughtful plan and the means to execute. They listen to customers and are flexible enough to adapt to changing conditions. Personally, I would love to see them open up a little farther north in Bucks, and look into cross marketing with local coffee roasters where the best local Java and rounders were available in the same places and advertised together. \n\nThe current situation is impressive, I suspect it will only get better from here! \n\nMy candidate for Bucks Bagels of the Year!",

    "text": "Stopped by for breakfast this week, and was treated to excellent service, meal and ambiance all rolled into one sunny, cool autumnal morn. \n\nI couldn't ask for better weather for sitting at a deuce in the front window and having the sun through the glass warm my shoulders. Even with the diaphanous shades drawn to reduce the glare, the room was bright, white, and clearstory cheery. The dining area walls were all glass, letting in the beautiful bucolic 360 degree panoramas. I was warmly greeted and had hot strong Ellis Coffee on my table when I return from the WC.  \n\nThe menu had creative breakfasts on one side, and lunches on the other.  They change their signature quiche and frittata daily as described by my lovely server.  In addition, they offer pancakes, french toast, omelets and Caleb's Breakfast Sandwiches; with each coming in tempting varieties, like French Toast Bananas Foster, and seasonal specialties. I could have gone in any direction with all the sweet temptation, but chose their take on a sandwich made of chicken sage sausage, cheddar and two fried eggs on a soft fresh brioche roll.  It came with home fried potatoes on the side. \n\nEverything was great!\n\nThe sandwich arrived leaking melted cheddar onto the plate that ran into the taters. It was overloaded, and could not be contained in my hands. With each bite one of the split sausage links fell out and had to be replaced.  Ultimately, I gave up on that and used knife and fork to handle what the challenged roll could not.  No problem.  It allowed each element to be savored separately and in combination.  Although the brioche could have been stronger, I have no complaints when the result is a veritable cornucopia of delicious pieces falling to the plate and being forked up in harmony with the home fries.  Those chunky tubers were excellent, too.  Just enough big pieces to hold the spices tossed onto them on the grill, and small enough for well done nibs to provide a tasty crunch. They were super fine, deserving recognition via their own photo. Let's not forget the Ellis brew that was free flowing and a strong wake up/washdown for this superlative breaking of the fast. \n\nCan't speak for the other meals, but Caleb's does a might fine midweek morning repast.  Maybe a few bucks more cher than non-Lahaska cafes, but so very worth the experience.",

The menu is very interesting with the use of standard ingredients prepared by hands trained in formerly socialist republics. \n\nI ordered the Tomato Feta Omelet. It was cooked in a personal sized polished steel pan and served to me still burning hot in that instrument, on an oval wooden insulating plank. The outer egg was almost a souffle texture and the taste was great. It came with two chunks of bread and a small dish of sweet butter. The bread had a crisp crust warm enough to melt the spread. It was also excellent and left me wishing for more. \n\nThe final surprise was the brewing of La Colombe coffee; strong enough to take immediate notice, and a pitcher of milk for mixing to my preferred shade of auburn. It was so good!\n\nService was efficient and beautifully accented. \n\nThis was a surprising and awesome meal at a very reasonable price. It was good to visit Kiev for a few minutes.",

South of the Border music playing a touch too loud, and the Mexican soaps on the HDTV muted, leaving a lot of facial expression without voices. \n\nMy Torta Carnitas (Grilled Pork Sandwich) was stuffed with shredded pork, lettuce, tomato, queso fresca and mayo.  The Roll was for this \"small\" sandy was larger than a typical Kaiser, with smooth skin and soft, fresh textured body.  It held together well, although it required considerable squeezing to compress it sufficiently to fit in mi boca grande. \nI also saw a fruit drink at another table that looked very tempting.  I inquired about it and discovered that they make fresh fruit smoothies and shakes for a few bucks.  I got the strawberry shake and it was cool smooth sweet berry addicting succulence. \n\nI skipped dinner tonight because this meal was so satisfying. \n\nSo good to be back.

There you can scan some of the home cooked meals offered by Proprietress Tina and her crew, as well as a sampling of her tasty baked goods. \n\nThe dining room is to the left, and bathed in bright sunlight on this Saturday morn. Only one table was occupied by a grandfather/granddaughter team, so I gamboled to the other side near the bar for my seat. Orders are taken at the register, so I returned there after perusing the two sided laminate menu. \n\nLots of healthy choices, and I selected the Hungry Person Breakfast Sandwich (3 eggs, 3 small homemade sausages, American cheese, tomato, greens on toasted thick sliced brioche). It was so large upon delivery to me that I asked that it be cut in half so I would have a chance to pick it up and take a bite without it falling apart in my hands. \n\nWell, it sort of fell to pieces under pressure from the kitchen knife anyway, but it still looked great when it came back to me. It still wasn't possible to secure it by hand with all the slippery ingredients, so I went after it with knife and fork. I combined different elements on the tines of my fork and jammed each into my mouth, my jaws as wide open as possible. \n\nIt was totally worth the effort.\n\nThe parts were as good as the whole. \n\nI took home a square of Tina's Key Lime Strawberry bar for later enjoyment.

    "text": "Pho Le Lai is a Vietnamese restaurant located on St. Vincent Street in the Mayfair neighborhood of Northeast Philadelphia. It is found in the same building as 1st Asian Supermarket, making it convenient to eat and shop for our Southeast Asian grocery needs. Both are closer to our Bucks County home, saving time compared to either Chinatown (traffic & parking) or Washington Avenue (traffic). \n\nI was the sole customer when I walked in around 3 P.M. The cordial manager got up from reading the newspaper and seated me at the table next to her and handed me their multi page menu. Another friendly woman came out of the kitchen with a pitcher of cold water, to answer questions and take my order. That was simple - Pho Tai and Roast Pork Banh Mi (This is a pho house, after all.) \n\nTen minutes later she was back with the \"Small\" bowl of steaming beef noodle soup requested, and a side plate of exceptionally fresh standard accoutrement (sprouts, sliced jalapeno, Thai basil sprigs and lime wedge). I took a pair of new wood chopsticks and flat bottomed spoon from the table holder and doctored the pho to my taste, paying attention to pull apart the nest of noodles lying beneath the surface of the dark broth (Northern Vietnamese style). \n\nThe flavor profile displayed some depth and had been simmering in a large pot for a long time. It wasn't quite as rich as Pho 75 or Pho Ha, but it was very good and didn't require help from the Sriracha bottle rocket on the table. It was plenty spicy with the addition of the jalapeno. \n\nI was content to slurp away and patiently lift noodles out of the caldron and fold them onto the spoon before shoveling them into my mouth. \n\nThe Banh Mi arrived minutes later. It was a full sized sandwich on decent French baguette, cut in half. Like the pho, it was larger than anticipated, especially for $6!  It was loaded with dark roast pork, daikon radish, carrot, aioli and cilantro. I added a long squirt of Hoisin to bring up the savoriness of that combo, and took a bite. From crusty roll through crisp daikon and ultimately tender pork, it was delicious and captivating. It was a complete oral and tactile experience. One of the best sammys I've enjoyed since Ocean Grove, California, the capital of Vietnamese America. \n\nAlong with China Gourmet, the excellent dim sum emporium also in that building, the presence of Pho Le Lai make St. Vincent Street a strong destination for your Asian taste buds and culinary needs.",

After spreading the melting butter, followed by the pouring of rich brown syrup, it was ready for sampling.\n\nIt was the best french toast I have had in a long time. \n\nService was also above expectations.

Housed in a former bank from the Golden Age, the high ceiling and neo-classical architecture are a fitting backdrop for the high quality and superior platters conceived and executed in the kitchen woks. \n\nWe had a 15 minute wait for our table to be ready, but the time was well spent at the bar sipping an excellent Malbec and adjusting to the bustle of a busy Friday night. Really liked our table in the back under the dramatic staircase. More private and romantic.\n\n We ordered four dishes prepared in different styles, and moderately to seriously spiced. Cumin lamb, dry fry beef, dry pepper fish and string beans with minced pork, arrived seven minutes after our excellent server accepted our requests. The quickness surprised us. Yet, each dish was perfectly plated and at their peak flavor. None were overly oily, and each distinct in their texture and taste, despite the use of similar Szechuan red and black peppers. Everything was delicious, and we were glad for over-ordering so we had plenty to bring home. \n\nThe size of the room was unusual for an American Chinese restaurant, and reminded us of the large banquet showrooms popular in China. It added to the authenticity of the overall experience. \n\nI didn't remember Han D. being such a complete and satisfying night when across the street. Whatever it is, they have it going on now.

Thank you.\n\nWe chose Flight One, consisting of three 6 ounce pours of Paulaner Hefe Weissbier, Hardwood Park Pills and River Horse Cherry Berliner Weisse. They all came from freshly opened bottles. They were each distinct and very good. The Hefe was mildly bitter and peppery with a hint of clove and a surprising ripe banana-like end note. The Park Pils tasted of grass and grains and was cloudy like cider. The Cherry Berliner was sour and tart with a soft ruddy red tint. If we had more time we definitely would have saddled up for dinner and a second and third flight. Others had joined us at the bar and the dishes they were served were mighty appealing. \n\nOur impressions were so positive of Washington House that we decided we would come back for a full night of revelry with music, food, drink and room upstairs so as to extend the celebration to breakfast the next morning. \n\nIf only the theater next door had bruncheon concerts!",

    "text": "Those of us who remember and enjoyed the heyday of the Chambersburg section of Trenton, NJ, with Italian restaurants on practically every corner, felt a special sadness as one after another they began to close or move out of town to the suburbs. Over the last two decades as the neighborhood changed and the original families moved to greener lawns and better schools, they took most of their traditions and cultural institutions with them. When Amici's closed it's doors recently, the Italian era of this capital city was officially over. \n\nYet, there is another casa Siciliana still going strong after 30 years at the same location. It might not be in the \"Burg,\" but sure feels like it once you step inside. Enzo's sits almost invisibly on the northern end of Princeton Avenue in Lawrenceville, west of the Brunswick Circle. It is a small, cozy, darkly lit, romantic hideaway, where the Scozzari family has been running a pure Italian kitchen for two generations. I sure hope there is a third.\n\nPark in back and walk past the outdoor dining area, through the front door and then a second one on the right. Step down into the small dining room and be greeted by Anna, daughter of the namesake Enzo, who will seat you at one of only dozen or so tables, and hand you the menu. Moments later, the head waiter approaches with water and description of the available specials. There is a small lunch menu with soups, sandwiches, and pasta plates. \n\nThey didn't have the Italian Hot Dog I desired (being removed from the menu), but the suggested alternative, their \"World Famous Meatball Sandwich,\" sounded about right. \n\nAnd, it was. Excellently garlicked, crusty toasty Italian loaf, stuffed with hand-rolled meatballs,  sauteed broccoli rabe, spinach and roasted red peppers, with a side a sweet tater fries, all on a large white round plate. Delicious! I like to deconstruction a sandwich and eat its elements separately to savor each ingredient. I did that for half and had a mouthful of flavor with each bite. It was unforgettable. The second half I attacked\u200b en masse. Cleaving through it and enjoying the texture and taste of each bite as they melded in my mouth. No red gravy here. Just each part doing its job to make me happy. Quite a total experience for a lunch. \n\nGot to go back for a romantic dinner soon with the woman of my dreams and a couple bottles of Chianti.\n\nEnzo's is the real thing.",

These days you can detour to Bristol, PA, and stop in to Cindy's Caf\u00e9 on old Mill Street, and have breakfast or lunch within its sunny clime. The local family running the show loves both Bristol and Key West, and lives in both. They come by their passion for Trop Rock and old downtowns on the river naturally. \n\nThe former Station Stop has been transformed into a bright, cheerful beachside retreat, where good coffee and delicious meals abide. The walls are covered with their personal artifacts, from post cards to family photos to clothing worn to protect them from the Tropic of Cancer sun. Steve, Patty and Kelly are excited and proud of what they have created out of personal tragedy, and they all work with heart, soul and mind fully invested. \n\nMy sausage, egg and cheddar breakfast sandwich was one of the better renditions I have had the pleasure to devour.  There is a real chef in the kitchen who knows that runny fried eggs are much better than a hard finish, and the use of a fresh, quality roll or bun is the best way to contain the dynamic ingredients, and absorb the drippage for delectable texture and flavor. The side of home fries was a nice extra touch, although I am partial to skin-on red bliss potatoes for my morning fries. The java was hot and strong, too. \n\nMill Street is really coming on with many new restaurants and shops. What was once a main drag to avoid, has become a place of entertaining choices, with international cuisine and loads of local talent. Cindy's Caf\u00e9 also does its own Key Lime Pie @ $3.50 a slice. Very tempting for later in the day. \n\n\"...Big straw hat, banana drink\nI can't remember what it is I think\nAnd my, my, my - Key Lime Pie...\nNot too tart, not too sweet\nMy baby loves to watch me eat\nHer Key Lime Pie\nHer Key Lime Pie!... \n(Key Lime Pie - Kenny Chesney - Be As You Are; Songs from an Old Blue Chair)\n\nWill be back for that KLP, KLP.",

    "text": "You can tell that folks in the Newtown, Bucks County, PA, area were hungry for great pizza, because Vince's Pizzeria and Taproom was absolutely jammed at 4:30 on the weekday afternoon I stopped in to check it out. There was hardly an empty parking space to be found. \n\nAnd, I understand why. Our region has a load of pizza shops, but extremely few that really know the pizza business (read, none). The people behind Vince's have several generations invested in making superlative dough and sauce, and using quality cheeses to create exceptional pies. Only the sainted DeLorenzo's transplanted from Jersey compares. \n\nLuckily for me, there was room at one of the large community tables in the back of the house. Everyone was friendly and welcoming. We ended up in extended conversations as we chowed down. There was a couple from Yardley, and another from Trenton, NJ. We were all there to sample the wares, and drink from the fountain of beers along the rear wall. It worked fairly well, although it was obvious that they were still on their shakedown cruise, this being their first week in operation. \n\nThe taproom concept is still new and not readily available. It requires the purchase of a RFID chipped card that attaches above the tap to the beer selected, releasing the brew into 12 oz. glasses which are filled by the customer. The available inventory is pictured above each tap, with brief description to help you choose. The beer card is good for 32 oz., after which you must pay for a reinfusion of funds. It all gets a bit complicated, as it seemed that the staff was repeated asking for a credit card for that, and again at check out. I handed mine over three times - there should be a better system in place. \n\nYet, all is forgiven because the tomato pie/pizza is so damn good! The crust is thin, but stays firm from first munch to last. No drooping points here. The taste is like a first rate cracker, with a little saltiness that offsets the mild sweetness of the sauce above. There is just the right ratio of red to white, so there is no excess run off from cheese oils, nor watery tomatoes. From first steaming bite to last cool belly filler, the consistency is constant with crunchy crust and easily distinguishable ingredients. These are high quality pies. \n\nAll  I can say is that the other pizza joints in and around Newtown are in trouble now. The competition just jumped up a few notches. Once word gets out that Vince's is the new sheriff in town, the old boys will find themselves out of luck, and will have to improve their game if they want to stay in business. \n\nIt's about time!  Thank you, Vince's!",

They offer house made meats and pasta trays, as well as smoked meats from the old country. Think of it as a mini DiBruno's, and you get an idea of what is going on in there. Just too bad it isn't larger so that it could show more delectables. Too, it would be great to have a seating area and mange what they turn out right on the premises. \n\nWe stopped in for lunch earlier in the week. I ordered an eggplant parm sandwich, which was excellent from crusty sesame loaf down to the well double fried nightshade and mildly tart red sauce. My companion ordered a personal size pizza with sausage. That disc left my car with a pleasant aroma for days afterwards. Will be returning for one of those babies. \n\nStaff was pleasant and very knowledgeable. Prices were fair, but it is hard to walk away with just a sandwich when the shelves are full of interesting and tasty snacks and side dish possibilities. \n\nPalantes is almost too good for the neighborhood, yet with Richboro Coffee right next door, the opportunity to trade off each other presents several excellent choices for nosh and java combos. Wonder if the coffee vendor would permit someone to enjoy a tasty repast at their small sitting area and make the world a better place for everyone? \n\nI would definitely sign up for that!",

The doors were locked and lights off on a midweek morning, and no notice posted that it was closed for vacation, or for good? Having come that far, I checked Yelp for an alternative kitchen in the neighborhood. It showed me Welcome Home, a cafe about two miles away in Jenkintown. \n\nI arrived there and found meter parking around the corner for $.50 for an hour. \n\nThis is a small cubby hole of a breakfast/lunch joint. 8 deuce tables at most. Walking in, I was greeted warmly by a lovely woman, who exclaimed, \"Welcome Home.\" She immediately warmed my heart with her salutation. I sat in the back of the dining room, right in front of the glass partition with the kitchen. I was handed their small menu, followed quickly by a mugga joe. It was hot and brisk. I inquired about the French Toast Casserole. Learning that it was very sweet, and asked that it be less so. She said that could be done, and a few moments later, I had a three inch high stack of Texas Toast that had been well dipped in a egg/sugar/cinnamon/vanilla slurry and pan fried/assembled into one united structure. Strawberries and cream on top. \n\nYes. It was delicious from top to bottom, and even the accompanying sausage links played their second fiddle role well. I came in joneszing for sweet fried bread, and was completely satisfied. \n\nWelcome Home is Black Woman owned and operated by Stephanie, who is the guiding light and creative force. Her personality dominates the proceedings in a great way. The combination of character and kitchen magic makes this place a keeper and highly worthy of your exploration. Be sure to bring hungry taste buds.\n\nBut for living in Bucks County, I would make Welcome Home a true and regular stop on my breakfast trail. It is that unique and appealing.",

    "text": "Nonno's (Grandfather's) Bakery on South York Street, Hatboro, PA, is an old school Italian artisanal bake shop where everything you behold is made on site, and generally produces high quality cookies, pastries, donuts, fruit tarts, pies and an extraordinary number of marzipan fruit miniatures. \n\nI stopped in after lunch down the street at Gallo Tropical, looking for interesting desserts for me and to take home for the fam. Upon entry I quickly realized that I had entered an unexpected time machine that would carry me back to childhood adventures with my parents and grandparents shopping the small ethnic stores in the Upper West Side of Manhattan, where Jewish and Italian delis, butchers, fish mongers and fruit stalls kept us fed and connected to our heritage. \n\nNonno's display cases were full of beautiful cakes and the like that required time to explore and difficult choices to be made among the incredible bounty of colorful, luxuriously tempting items. There is a health limit to the quantity of sugar anyone should consume, and this bakery would push that to the max. So, I let my camera do the tempting while I selected only a few things that were turning me on. A slice of carrot cake to cover the pastries, two donut twists to sample their coffee companions, and a marzipan banana to tease on the fruit bowl of choices created by the creative hand of their talented almond paste sculptors. Sure, it wasn't enough, but now I know where these artists are, and can return at will.\n\nThe carrot cake was not what I imagined would be a heavy cake base with uber sweet cream cheese icing; but instead a light gingery cake and a mildly sweet layer of butternut-like topping. It was excellent in this format. More subtle taste than the diner version. The donuts were a yeasty twist, still moist and chewy, with a delicious thin layer of icing that was a slow pleasure to eat. Better than anticipated. The marzipan banana (as were all the trayed fruit) was a softly firm almond paste that was best taken in small bites and masticated with attention to the release of that unique and seductive almond flavor that expanded as chewed. Ummm...\n\nIt wasn't a complete Roman heaven. I skipped the cookies covered with jimmies, and the cannoli prefilled with vanilla sweet ricotta (I'm not a jimmies guy, and prefer my cannoli filled when ordered). Nonetheless, Nonno's Bakery is a worthy destination to satisfy that part of your sweet tooth that can only be satisfied by high quality old world goodies.",

Meaty, tender, pull off the bone and barky, this hole in the wall is considered the best Q in New Jersey by those who know. \n\nThe main man himself learned the wood science while in Texas and brought his experience and original notions with him when he came here. The sauce is Kansas City red tart, but the secret lies in the wild cherry wood logs with which the meats are smoked for 12-13 hours in the huge closed steel smoker out back of the market. \n\nThe wood is the thing in the hands of a well trained smoke chef, and Jeff has developed it to the height of culinary arts it was meant to be. You can taste it in the mild sweetness in the heart of each rib before it is overcome by the spicy Kansas City rub and sauce, and yet again by the more tangy squirt squeezed on as the final step before eating. \n\nThis was great BBQ. At $14/lb, it was not cheap, but what you would pay for eat in platters, not takeout. Nonetheless, sometimes the splurge is worthwhile. It certainly was this time. The brisket looked just as good, as did their smoked beans. \n\nNext time for those.",

The low 20th century prices didn't lead me to think differently. Sure, the furnishings were likewise dated, but it all came together to create the perfect environment for a traditional Philadelphia brekkie, sans all the hoopla of the nouveau brunch scene. \n\nFrom our perch on two spinners at the counter, we sipped the Bunn java and watched the full house deep in convos and good winter Saturday morning feast-ivities. When our Spanish Omelet and A Hot Mess 'kitchen sink' omelet arrived, we were very ready to chow down with gusto. \n\nAnd gusto was what we got. Each was a 3 egger, so full of ingredients that it was surprising that everything got tucked in. The ham, peppers, onions, cheese and salsa in the Spanish melded wonderfully and the taste/texture was great. The home fries were crisp, yet buttery, and all we needed were splashes of Crystal Hot Sauce to complete the excellent profile. The Hot Mess threw everything in the kitchen including the potatoes into the egg shell. How they zipped it up without leakage remained a secret. It was filling and delicious, and the rye toast added a touch of subtle sour savoriness that was good to the last bite. \n\nDew Inn is another awesome corner breakfast joint that the City of Brotherly Love is so rightly famous for.

Although mostly black and grey, the front bar/ lounge was beautifully sedate, and the dining room spacious with room between tables and large windows bringing in late afternoon light before the coming of dusk. It was impressive, and on this Tuesday evening, not crowded at all, which enhanced the sense that we had chosen well. \n\nWe were seated at a table mid floor, but asked to be moved near an electric outlet in order to charge a cell phone. They graciously obliged. Our server quickly introduced himself and brought drink and food menus. The wine and beer lists were broad enough without necessitating a trip to the wine cellar. My old friend selected a glass of zinfandel, while my beautiful date picked a light small brewery pilsner, and I a pineapple cider (delicious). We settled in with the drinks and caught up while perusing the menu. \n\nWe kept dinner on the lighter side, with a Chopped Greek Salad, Mushroom Burger and Fig Jam Burger for yours truly. At $15 per slider, the price was high, but still much more in line with our appetites than the entrees which were double the cost. So, we felt that management was smart to offer smaller options that allowed for drinks and/apps and a reasonable bottom line. Besides, we thoroughly enjoyed our meals. The burgers were half pounders with brioche rolls and homemade potato chips or fries. The fig jam added a nice sweet dimension to my burger. My friend asked for grilled scallops added to the salad, but when the kitchen lacked them, they inquired if he would be satisfied with shrimp instead. He was. \n\nWe were happy with our experience at Greystone. It was qualitatively superior to the previous tenants who tried to make a go of it in the old mansion on the road between Newtown and Washington Crossing. The outdoor patio looked appealing, but with the steam heat unrelenting even into the evening, now was not the time to try it out. \n\nThis was an interlude even George himself would enjoy.",

Not only is the food superlative, but the house is beautifully designed with high ceilings, stone accented walls, unusual rope lighting and attractive serving dishes. It's great to see Ctown dress up and show its more sophisticated side in the hot, spicy and numbing world of Chengdu cuisine. \n\nWe ordered seven dishes for the two of us, with enough to take home for the rest of the family. Allow me to enumerate:\n\n* Sliced Beef & Tripe w Chili Sauce - Served cold but loaded with high temperature chilis, it was a great starting point. The textures of thin firm beef and loose tripe and the prickly feel of chili beginning the night of hotter and hotter choices;\n\n* Takoyaki - Try to imagine whipped squid shaped into large marble sized balls. Creamy, yet definitely crustacean; slightly sweet, but also mildly fishy and sticky on the teeth. Very unusual, but surprisingly tasty;\n\n* Spicy Shredded Beef - Tender mixed with pepper, onion, sprout,  Szechuan reds and a smattering of black  peppercorn and light film of chili oil, all of which continued to raise the Celsius in our mouths;\n\n* Cumin Lamb Chops - The star of the show. Eight baby chops grilled and covered in more hot peppers, with bone wrapped in foil for ease of handling. Absolutely delicious enough to allow us to ignore the growing conflagration in the quest to strip every morsel of lamb from the finger width bone. Simply amazing; \n\n* Pan Seared Green Shishito Pepper - Beautiful rich shiny green. An explosive pleasure to consume. These boys appeared to have an inner glow, and were as burning hot as they were gorgeous to behold. They may be an acquired taste, but thankfully I have acquired it;\n\n* Spicy Sliced Fish - White fish fillets is a large sculpted iron cauldron full of multiple peppers, including black peppercorns for numbing anesthetic effect on the tongue and gums, black fungus and sprouts in a deeply fired near molten liquid that both punished and delighted. \n\nSure, there is a degree of masochism to loving Szechuanese food, but once the burn subsides as it always does, the full capsaicin rush can be fully appreciated as a successful challenge to the senses that grows on you. \n\nOvercome and carry on.",

Although I was considering Flautas, Chili Rellenos, or Torta Milanese, when I arrived, I changed my mind for a walk on the wild side and ordered La Gringa, one of their specials that seemed to cover a lot of bases (sauteed veggies, ham, chorizo, melted cheese and crema drizzle). It was well reviewed, so I rolled with the optimistic sense I came in with. \n\nWithin 10 minutes a large white ceramic plate arrived, with Red Rice & Black Beans and hot Tortillas. It was all delicious, even though I didn't understand why the dish was called \"Gringa,\" (North American Girl). No doubt there was a story there, but the servers didn't seem to know it. Even without the additional local color, it was a fine filling meal. It wasn't overly spicy, but not everything has to be a conflagration for me to be happy. \n\nWhile not as intensely authentic as the kitchens found in the Hispanic neighborhoods of Trenton or Norristown, it was plenty good enough for me. No hesitation coming again.",

    "text": "That Johnny Longhots has a great name for an Italian sandwich shop is beyond doubt. Reminds of Robert Louis Stevenson's Long John Silver in the great novel classic, Treasure Island. Capturing an image of pirate treasure and devious scalliwags as part of your business image has gotta be a strong beginning for this new enterprise on Oxford Valley Road in Fairless Hills, PA. \n\nThat they also turn out fantastic sandwiches, steaks and the like, means they can back up the talk (advertising) with action. My Italian Hot Dog was amazing. Three quality frankfurters in a sesame torpedo roll topped with a load of roast potato, Italian frying pepper, sauteed sweet onion, mustard and ketchup, and doctored with hot banana peppers from the fixings bar, makes for a memorable chomp down. It was the best I've enjoyed in many years. \n\nAt nearly $9 it wasn't cheap, but when you realize there is really enough there for two people or to take home half for later consumption, the value proposition comes into focus. Come with your favorite +1, or pack and carry for your later pleasure. \n\nJohnny Longhots is good for eat in or carry out, or both, as I just discovered. \n\nTotally impressive. Definitely a Treasure Island!",

    "text": "I've been kicking myself for several days now for not dining at The Churchville Inn before last Friday night. Living in central Bucks County for decades, someone should have alerted me to how good it was; and after joining Yelp I should have scouted it out myself long before. Mea Culpa! \n\nNow that the boys and I have have broken the ice, we are in accord that we just had one of the best Bucks sups we can remember.  We mixed and matched the Whole Chicken Wings with Reaper (extremely hot) Sauce, Red Buds, Half Rack of Baby Backs, and the Maple-Bacon BBQ Grilled Salmon. \n\nThe wings were about the biggest I'd ever seen; plump, juicy and scalding to near numbness. Big hit!  The Red Buds were an app, but enough for a meal, with a mix of braised bacon, pulled pork and melted cheddar. Nice take on traditional twice baked potatoes.  The salmon wasn't a large steak, but with the maple bacon thickened to a fire glaze, it was great. The mashed sweets were a mellow counterpoint.  The star of the show were the ribs. Meaty, tangy and suck off the bone awesome. There was no choice of finishes, but no one complained.  They were a great gnaw. We had no though of dessert.  \n\nThe inn facility is large and country comfortable, with downstairs and upstairs dining rooms and upside bar. No doubt we will have many happy returns.",

    "text": "Just so happens that Momma D's Soul Food 2 is down Broad Street from my Trenton office. I don't know why I hadn't tried it before now, but the good news is that I'm off the schnied. \n\nI ordered through the Yelp GrubHub connection, which was easy to do, and when I received the message that my Meatloaf, Yams, Fried Cabbage and Corn Bread meal was ready, I walked over to get it. The chef/manager/owner mistook me for the GrubHub delivery guy and addressed me as such a bit dismissively. An understandable mistake that we cleared up when we both realized that while I used that service, I was not of that agency. I was just the neighbor down the street come to pick up my food. Introductions completed, we parted on a first name basis. \n\nI want to remain on good terms with Momma D, because that first meal made a lasting first impression. It was fantastic. The meatloaf was loose, rather than dense, just the way my mother used to make from the recipe she found on an old Quaker Oats round box. Mixed with the rich dark brown gravy, it was a glorious romp down memory lane, complete with all the excess calories. The yams were soft and sweet, and the cabbage tender and nicely spiced. The cornbread was as good as a fresh squared corn muffin. There was more than enough in the carry out styro for at least two filling meals. Given that quantity, the value proposition was outstanding.\n\nThis kitchen also turns out other favorites; fried chicken, whiting and BBQ beef ribs, not to mention several other sides and desserts (peach cobbler, anyone?!) So, I will be back when I find myself working late and getting hungry. The choices are rich and fattening, so I will have to watch the urge to splurge. \n\nOnly suggestion - Improve the takeout containers to a grade that doesn't leak. I hated to lose all that gravy that I found in the bottom of the large plastic bag I carried it back to the office in. Otherwise, it was a home run.",
