To kick it up a notch I stuffed in Jalapeno Chips for a spicy crunch. \nIt was great on an afternoon when autumn is starting to assert itself with bluster.  \n\nThis excellent local establishment continues to turn out first rate creative dishes thanks to the ever-present Micha, and her friendly staff.  It has become my most constant breakfast companion, and often my lunch date, as well.  \n\nIf you have not been in for a taste of home cooking with a Korean flare, you don't know what you are missing. \n\nFind a way to get there.  Sit down and become part of the family.",

    "text": "My office neighbor and I went to lunch at La Vecchia Osteria this afternoon, after postponing our plans a few times due to busy schedules.  So glad we finally made it!\n\nWe were greeted warmly by the owner, Pasquale, and served by his beautiful daughter. The side room was bright with the winter sun streaming in the windows and making the golden amber room glow.  The corner table offered a little privacy, but it was not crowded today.  Small Antipasto with a mix of prosciutto, salami, hard cheeses, buffalo mozz.,  black and green olives to begin.  Fresh, crusty bread with olio and herb dip.  Grilled\nBranzino filleted after cooking, and just before bringing to the table.  Pure white tender with light extra virgin and lemon.  Perfect!  My friend had Chicken\nBreast in olive oil and capers, with a side of Vodka Rigatoni.  We stopped our chat while we savored our repast.  \n\nConversation resumed with a slightly gazed countenance of satisfaction as we finished with coffee and sharing a homemade Cannoli that was so smooth, sweet, and creamy that we had to close our eyes to fully absorb the experience.  \n\nOh well, another dinnerless night.  But, it was so worth it!",

    "text": "If you are like me, and enjoy a small business success story served with whipped cream and strong coffee, the Old Croydon Caf\u00e9 is just about as good as it gets.  \n\nI stopped in for the first time this week and took a stool at the counter.  From my vantage point I could look into the kitchen service window and see the heads of the cooks making magic out of eggs and pancake mix.  The old joint is on the north end of State Road, which I soon discovered could be used as a detour from Rt. 95, all the way to Center City.  Good to know!\n\nThe place is small, with 7 or 8 stools and an equal number of booths and tables.  I sat next to a house painter, lawn mower repair man, and a roofer.  The conversation was cordial and full of gallant repartee.  The owners worked front and back and kept the dishes coming along with the warm banter.  I really liked OCC even before my French Toast Deluxe arrived.  This was as downhome as this part of Pennsylvania gets. \n\nWhen my breakfast arrived I beheld an oval plate framing a still life watercolor.  The 3 slices of well grilled and caramelized French Toast, topped with Fresh Whipped Cream and Blueberries, Strawberries, and Bananas, and finished with a lazy drizzle of Blueberry Sauce. (See Photo) The toast was hot, the cream cool, and the fruit cold and juicy.  The tastes and textures were fun and delicious.  It was one of those meals that I did not want to end.  \n\nOld Croydon Caf\u00e9 has definitely made my very short list of favorite breakfast nooks.  I will return to explore the menu, and even come back for lunch when possible.  \n\nThis place is a hidden treasure.",

    "text": "\"Welcome to Nirvana,\" he said with a open faced smile that hinted that he had practiced this line many times as an owner of Nirvana Fusion.  He waited for his words to penetrate and for our reaction.  \n\nMagically, we were transported to the Himalayas in Nepal, where we would dine this night.  You see, the \"fusion\" in Nirvana Fusion comes from the fact that the owners and chef of this mountain house are from Nepal, where they are at the cross currents of north Indian and southwest Chinese culture.  Fusion comes naturally when you grow up in it.  Both cuisines roll over each other, mix and retreat with each human tide; leaving behind something that is both informed by their neighbors, and creative of a new reality where turmeric and curry meet chili and dragon fruit.  The similarities are undeniable.  The uniqueness, extraordinary.  \n\nThe menu read differently than those of similarly named restaurants.  Extra time was needed to penetrate, and many questions had to be answered by our hosts.  We were curious.  They were patient.  We ultimately ordered the Chili Chicken (Dry) and Gobi Manchurian (Dry) appetizers, the Chicken Zafrani traditional Indian dish, and the Vegetable Hakka Noodles from the Indo/Chinese/Thai Fusion section, to try a cross section of their offerings.  \n\nBoth the apps were spicy hot and looked surprising similar in deep red amber sauces.  The Chili Chicken tasted of both Chili and Tumeric in the thick sauce coating the small morsels of chicken.  It was very good and left our mouths burning without reaching numbness.  The Gobi (deep fried cauliflower) in another dark sauce with pieces of clumped spices sticking to everything, was excellent in that the vegetable flavor and texture remained although bathed in the heavy float.  The cross fertilization of cultures was most evident here.  The Chicken Zafrani was more straight forward North Indian with a softer curry infused with the sweetness of Almonds, Cashews and Saffron.  There were also Kashmiri Chilies in there, but they did not dominate.  Finally, the Hakka Noodles really seemed more a straight up Chinese dish very akin to a chunky Lo Mein.  Very nice. \n\nNirvana Fusion took me by surprise - a pleasant one.  It is definitely deserves returning for more adventures.  \n\nWe weren't in Hatboro anymore, Toto.",

    "text": "When all the other historic sites in Philadelphia were closed because of shut downs and furloughs coming from the nonsense in Washington, alone in staying proudly open was Carpenter's Hall, much as it has since its founding in 1770.  \n\nAn excellent example of Georgian style architecture, it was built by the first trade union in the United States, The Carpenters' Company.  It was here that the American Revolution really began with the First Continental Congress in 1774, when delegates from 12 colonies (nee Georgia), met to decide how to respond to the mounting British oppression.  They voted to boycott all English goods, and to meet again the following year should this not be enough to solve the problem.  The rest, as we all know, is our history.  \n\nBen Franklin opened his Library Company on the second floor.  The first and second National Bank of the United States used the first floor for several years before grander quarters were built nearby (and ultimately failed when challenged by Andrew Jackson years later). \n\nThe building is set back from Chestnut Street, and approaching it gives a perspective of how it much have felt to do so in the 18th Century on cobblestone, horse manure, oil lamp streets.  It has a modest nobility for a structure so old and prominent in our nation's struggles for freedom.  Its larger grander cousin, Independence Hall, soon overtook it as the symbol of this fight and the center of courageous political discourse on the path to nationhood, but Carpenters' Hall continued to play a significant role as a meeting house for rebels and spies, the Philosophical Society, hospital, and Franklin's Library. \n\nIn a time when the struggle to birth a nation was very real and daunting, and men had to seriously pledge their sacred honor and very lives to take a stand, it is a sad comparison to realize how far we have fallen as a country this very day. Those people knew the meaning of what they were doing, and went ahead bravely. \n\n Where are those leaders today?  \n\nCarpenters' Hall awaits their awakening and offers a reminder of what true patriotism means.",

But, we must ask if Benjamin would have anything to say about the 19th Century propriety of calling this prodigious and glorious old boy, \"Ben,\" as opposed to his given name?  \n\nI'll stick with Benjamin until he and I are formally introduced and get on a first name basis.",

    "text": "As a sister city gift from Tianjin, China to Philadelphia, the Friendship Gate was the first of its kind in the USA. Engineers and artisans from the old country designed and built it on 10th Street at the corner with Arch Street.  When freshly painted (as it last was in 2008), it is a beautiful reminder of the cultural ties between two grand cultures, one very old, and the other quite new.  It is an accurate representation of a Qing Dynasty city gate that would historically be placed in an opening in the wall surrounding a city, or an approach to a holy site.  There is also magic spread over the structure with the carvings, painting and Chinese proverbs placed on it.  So, with a little belief and a lot of imagination, you can feel the changing atmosphere when entering or exiting Chinatown through this portal.  That is part of the reason why being in Chinatown feels so far away from the rest of our urban world. \n\nChinatown has suffered at the hands of last century's urban planners, as first one piece (Ben Franklin Bridge), and then another (Vine Street Expressway), and yet another (Philadelphia Convention Center) cut away at the neighborhood.  What was once a 12 block enclave, is now only 7.  Gentrification north of Vine will only make matters worse as the value of real estate skyrockets, forcing old owners out as taxes raise and rents follow. Luckily, the Phillies were not able to build their new ballpark where originally desired just off 12th and Vine. \n\nAlthough I usually approach Chinatown from the north (as the Mongols did), I try to make it a point to walk through Friendship Gate (driving under it does not provide the special spell).  Either before or after a great meal, haircut, or shopping adventure, a moment within its aura seems to lighten my load, and give a sense of connection with a 5,000 year old culture. \n\nWalk under it next time your in town.  Tell us how it felt.",

    "text": "I am normally not a fan of prix-fix menus, as they tend to be too limiting of choice, and suggests a kitchen unable to handle more options.  But, when that standard menu comes in 7 courses with additional vegetarian alternatives, and is packed into a Bedouin's tent of a restaurant, complete with belly dancing, baklava and honey tea, I can make an exception.  \n\nThis is multiplied many fold when your 40 closest friends are packed into a carpet clad room with barely enough room to sit down, and an ambient noise level loud enough to make talking to anyone but those right next to you impossible. Yet, with enough wine and North African music to alter consciousness, this becomes an all-consuming environment that transports you out of South Street and into the dark, mystic souk casbah of one of the ancient cities of Morocco. \n\nMarrakesh takes finger food to the ultimate.  From cool salads, to roast chicken, cumin lamb and grilled beef, cous-cous with veggies, the only thing between your fingers and the searing meal is the thin pita used to pinch, lift and stuff in your face.  Failing that, be prepared for first degree burns.  \n\nThe large metal serving trays kept coming with more food.  We all appreciated the concession to the use of towels to cover laps and wipe hands. Some of the braver souls accompanied our graceful dancer as she gyrated her hips, abdomen, shoulders and arms with cymbals ringing. Some of our folks really knew how to move.  Impressive.\n\nStepping back out onto Leithgow Alley after 4 hours within this transporter, it took a few moments to reorient myself to being back in Philadelphia after our wild ride.\n\nMarrakesh is not just a restaurant, it is a magic carpet.",

    "text": "It was good to be back in the old neighborhood again up along Baltimore Avenue in West Philly.  Things have changed around my old home at 48th and Balto, mostly for the better.  I was here a few months ago sampling the heat at Chili Szechuan, and this time I was back to meet up with Yelp friends at Mood Caf\u00e9, the Chaat & Lassi emporium on the point at 46th Street.  Lucky for me, they were delayed arriving, and I had an opportunity for a long talk with Hasan, the owner/chef/creative genius behind the concept and the counter that is Mood.  I got the $.50 tour, and an autobiography worthy of Horatio Alger. \n\nWhile I had eaten Chaat (pronounced, \"Chart\") before, it had never been like this.  Hasan has taken what is basically a common street food in India and turned it into an adventure in eating.  It comes at you in several dimensions - taste, texture, hardness/softness, shape, spice, food group, color and surprise.  It sat before me the most colorful assortment of edibles imaginable.  I had the Salad Chaat with Chicken, but there was so much happening inside that take out container that the meat was forgotten in the exploration of what was going on with all the reds, yellows, stars, logs, crispies, noodles, dried fruit, nuts, fresh mango, greens, feta cheese, chili sauces, curry notes, etc.  It is difficult to describe all the hyperactivity in that bowl.  Imagine an Indian version of Trail Mix thrown into a salad rather than croutons. If he had tossed in some M & M's I would not have been shocked.  This baby was Buh-Buh-Buh-Bizzzeee!!!\n\nAnd, bottom line, it was awesome. We tried each others dishes, and all were unique and captivating. \n\nAnd, that does not even get into the Lassis.  More than 60 varieties of cool, creamy yogurty, sweetness.  Mine?  A Rose Lassi, complete with Rose Petals! Not just amazing, but fun!  If this wasn't enough, Hasan brought us samples of other Lassi combos in small cups to try.  This man knows how to seduce with great taste. Oh. And did I mention the Kheer and Rice Pudding he gave us at the end? \n\nOver the Top!\n\nAs good as Mood Caf\u00e9 is, it is a very small shop.  Four tables with bench seats along the wall and plastic stools for everyone else.  So, not the most comfortable arrangement.  It is geared as a take out place, with everything served in take out containers and plastic utensils.  I would be willing to pay more for comfort.  \n\nThe sheer enjoyment of the event (yes, this was more than just a cool meal) kicks the experience into 5 Star territory.  In truth, there should be another category available on Yelp that addresses the euphoria and exclamations needed for certain special foodie moments.  \n\nMood Caf\u00e9 would reach that level of extreme amazed unadulterated satisfaction. \n\nYeowee!!!",

The oldies but goodies (Eddie's Donuts, Chuck's Chicken Wings, that great cheesecake place), are either long gone, or hanging on with other outlets out in the burbs. \n\nBut, along comes Halal Brothers, with its bright red, white and black logo, sparkling clean shop, friendly, accommodating ownership and outstanding Afghani menu, and all those preconceptions are thrown out the window.

I was there for lunch recently and almost fell in love.\n\nAt the counter I admitted to my first time there, and was offered a sample of their chicken and lemon chicken over rice. A minute later I was handed a small bowl of the two finished with white sauce and a touch of chili sauce. Diminutive, it was still beautifully presented and terrific. I sat down to eat it and tasted the panoply of flavors dancing on my tongue. Both the straight chicken and the lemony version were tender, moist and a mouth full of interesting exotic belly dancing.\n\nFrom there I decided on their chicken salad - the same regular chicken morsels with a load of salad (lettuce, tomato, onion, cheese, white sauce and spicy red hot sauce) in a bowl. With a bottled drink, $7. Quite a deal! And, it was as great as the sample. With check in on Yelp, a free triangle of baklava joined the party. Mine had a cream filling, rather than the better known honey nut stuffing. It was also very good, like a Bavarian Cream donut made with philo rather than cake dough. \n\nAll I can say is that such surprises deserve return visits and five star reviews.",

What used to be a food truck operation has now taken root on West Girard Avenue (2800 Block).

    "text": "Russell Gardens Center in Churchville, Bucks County, Pa., may not be the largest nursery garden plantation in the region, but in my estimation it is one of the best. I have been shopping here since moving to Bucks and starting a garden around the house (The enterprise is never done).  Originally, I was tipped off to its existence by a nurseryman friend who helped me with design and bare root tree planting.  He swore by Russell's for perennials and colorful annuals and shrubs that most other dealers either lacked, or only possessed in inferior quality.\n\nAs an example, twenty years ago I bought a small pot of Coreopsis, a hardy fern-like leafy base with yellow star flowers that bloom in late June/early July, and spread to fill any space they are in.  Yesterday, I returned to see what was new in this native American beauty.  Now, they are available in a few shades of red/orange, and most strikingly, in a red/yellow flower that is breathtaking in its simplicity and kinship to its elder cousin.  Love at first sight. It is now planted across the walkway from the original, and it is easy to imagine its growth over the coming years.  \n\nWe purchased 3 other low growing, shade loving varieties to replace the old builder's grade junipers that had run their course.  Three Heuchera with rich dark maroon/gray foliage, two Veronica (Speedwell) that push up spikes of pale blue to indigo flowers in early June, and three low dark green/purple grasses that spread through their roots to cover bare soil and need little maintenance. They are all happily in place beneath the living room window. \n\nAlways more work to do.  Plans call for a redo of the west side foundation plantings.  Russell Gardens will get the call as we lay out our plans.  Their inventory, knowledge and understanding of gardens and gardeners, makes it the place I trust most with suggestions and products. Prices are about the same as the other shops. \n\nRussell Gardens is why we dig in the earth.",

They have the integrity to tell you up front if they think they can't do the work as well as the dealer. How often have you had that happen? Well, Dave apologized that he thought he should pass on a particular problem I was having with my car, and recommended I take it to a dealer for the specialized treatment required.  I truly appreciated his honesty and directness.\n\nFor that and everything else he has done for me, Burns Auto Repair is deserving of 5 stars.\n\nI still wish Yelp would get his location right.

Dark woody tones, beautiful old bar, and aproned servers trained in the old ways.  It was a complete experience. \n\nTime passes, and as with almost all the casas Italiana in that great neighborhood, they moved out to the burbs to follow the migratory paths of their customers.  Sal's landed in Ewing on Pennington Road.  It took me many years before I found my way back, but I finally made it this week for a business lunch with a client. \n\nI expected it would only be a shadow of its former self, but I was wrong.  It wasn't a recreation of the Old World house, but about as good as a modern setting can be in attempting to capture the essence of the past. The atmosphere was still hushed, and the d\u00e9cor was both formal and comfortable at the same time. Cloth tablecloths, fresh flowers, large curtained windows all around, and servers in black gliding around the floor.  The menu was much as I remembered it. Fresh veal, chicken, pasta, soups and salads, served with roast potatoes and string beans. Side salad for every dish.  Lunch sized portions coming in around $8.95 per meal.  \n\nMy chicken francaise was two fillets, egged, and pan fried with a touch wine and lemon.  Excellent!  My business associate's platter was a grilled salmon, that he devoured with relish. The bread basket had a nice sliced loaf of very fresh crusty acqua y farina.  Overall, just an exemplary midday meal that completely out distanced my expectations. \n\nWould I return for another meal?  Without a doubt!  \n\nThis lunch was so good it made me forget how much I missed the old Sal's.",

Counter Culture beans and friendly skilled baristas/owners keeping their hands and hearts in their business. \n\nMy chai latte was excellent, served in a large dark blue ceramic cup and saucer.  My co-conspirator had a regular latte and almond biscotti, both of which he said he enjoyed. The casual atmosphere made for a good place to talk.  \n\nThey seem to be developing bakery oriented snack offerings in addition to the Italian dipping sticks.  Cookies, brownies, bagels of varying stripes were under glass up front.  Tempting, but too close to dinner to indulge.  \n\nIt is natural to compare The Coffee Room with Starbucks right down the street.  They are different in ambiance and selection of drinks and nosh.  Starbucks has more to eat and a larger drink menu on the wall, yet the coffee creations at The Corner Room seem higher quality, and certainly more tasty when comparing their respective javas straight up.  Here, there was no burnt taste so often associated with Mermaid coffee.  \n\nThere is plenty of room for both joints in Newtown.  \n\nWelcome to the hood!",

    "text": "30th Street Station, the main railroad station in Philadelphia, and the 3rd busiest Amtrak station in its system, has been open since 1933.  It is on the National Registry of Historic Places for its size, Corinthian columns, art deco decoration, gold and red paint coffered ceiling, and several innovations in station design - pneumatic tube system and its over-train passenger functionality, which allowed people departing trains under the station to immediately ascend into the station and avoid the soot and smoke of the earlier version locomotives.  I read somewhere that at one time there was a mortuary in the building, chapel, hospital space, and enough room to land a small aircraft.  Can't imagine that.\n\nIt is a beautiful structure as many reviews so well describe.  For me, it is really a museum of American transportation culture that is fully interactive and functional.  In addition to serving the transit needs of millions of people a year on the East Coast, and westward to Chicago and beyond, it offers art (Angel of the Resurrection,1952, by Walker Hancock, and Spirit of Transportation bas wall relief, 1895, by Karl Bitten); and multiple choices of fast and casual cuisine to provide a small measure of comfort to weary travelers. It has found its way into several iconic movies; Blow Out (1981), Trading Places (1983), and Witness (1985).  Seems like it is time for another cinematic experience. \n\n Along with its grander sibling up river, The Museum of Art, it offers spectacular examples of the vision of Philadelphia's City Mothers and Fathers over the past century.  In a city that was once the nation's largest, its capital, and the birthplace of our grand experiment in democracy, it is a living monument to that historic dream. \n\nI was a daily user of 30th Street Station, commuting to/from Trenton for several years. I came to appreciate it as a way station; meeting and becoming friends with people I met every morning, and said \"goodbye\" to most nights. Drinking the same coffee and buying a newspaper before the digital revolution made paper obsolete. Life on a train for a few hours a day is another story, but having this terminus start and end each workday forged a personal relationship with this edifice.  Like any sibling it was not always a lovefest, but I knew it was doing its best to make my commute bearable, if not deeply existential.\n\n But,you don't have to be going anywhere to enjoy a visit.",

    "text": "Zaika on Grant Avenue in Northeast Philly, is one of the best Pakistani/Indian restaurants I have ever had the pleasure of supping in.  I mean, there are some strong reviews from people I respect, but I didn't think I was about the experience a gastronomic wonder. Chef Mohammed has it going on!  \n\nSomewhat surprising that we were among the very few customers on a Sunday night, but no complaints. The house was recently renovated with a larger dining room, and a touch of class with comfortable seating and sparse, but attractive d\u00e9cor.  Our server, Nema, was excellent.  She knew the questions to ask to make sure we got what we wanted.  Correct level of spiciness, and the right dipping sauces for the dishes ordered. No ice for the water. When undecided about whether to go with garlic or chili naan, she had the ready solution of having the tandoor bake up a combo of the two.  Garlic chili naan, indeed, was a winner. \n\nThe rest was a cavalcade of wonderous dishes that expanded my understanding of what was truly possible in an IndoPak kitchen.  There were only three plates requested; a Samosa Chat app, Chicken Kashmiri and Bhaingan Bharta (eggplant). Each was uniquely distinct from similar plates in other restaurants, and each was outstandingly better.  \n\nThe Chat was a deconstructed Samosa, with the crisp fried dough on the bottom of a mass of tender chickpeas, potatoes and spicy homemade Masala sauce.  It was ordered for medium heat.  Auspicious beginning!  It had a complex flavoring and texture that was similar to other samosas, but somehow better, with a subtle sweet undernote to the usual fritter-like taste.  Delightful. \n\nThe Chicken Kashmiri was ordered because of familiarity with this dish elsewhere; knowing it to be cream based and a lightly sweet alternative to all the curried heat coming from the other sources.  This version was that, but so much more.  Rather than just the combination of the heat from the cream sauce, the sweetness was supplied by raisins, pineapple and dried apricots.  A complete and unexpected surprise, that was in turn a mystery to be solved.  It took a while to figure out what those flavors/textures were.  But, when realization dawned, so did a big smile at the elegantly simple, yet creative genius at work.  Pineapple and apricot discovery was better than a game of charades. I loved this masterstroke. \n\nThe Bhaingan was not as wildly original, but an excellent mashed roast eggplant, green peas, onion, pepper and tomato mixed with traditional herbs and spices.  Ordered hot, it was a nice counterpoint to the cooler sweetness of the Kashmiri. \n\nLast, but far from least, the Garlic Chili Naan, was a knockout bread sensation.  A bit oily, but the interplay of the two main ingredients so well seared to the surface of the naan, and the chewiness and absorption of the lightly crisped dough, made for great taste and the perfect utensil to pick up the sauces from each dish and slowly devour every last drop.   \n\nYes. There was a Mango Lassi, too.  Best way to cool an overheated tongue is to bathe it in cool mangoed yogurt drink.  \n\nZaika - The best meal I have had so far this year.",

    "text": "All the reviews capture the rare beauty of the Wissahikon Valley, carved out by the creek by the same name over the past 125 million years.  It is an amazing work of nature so close to the urban Philadelphia center.  \n\nThe only things I can add are from an historic and geologic perspective.  The reference to the hermit cave derives from a settlement of Christian end of days sect who lived primitively along the creek in the 19th Century. The ruins remain in some places. \n\nIf you love rocks, the Valley is a very special place as well.  Due to a fault line that runs nearby, the area has shifted significantly over the millennia. The rock we see today was once more than 10 miles below the surface. The tectonic plates lifted and convoluted the strata of rock with pressure and heat so great that the nature of the rock changed from a granite bedrock formation into a waving and blistered schist.  It can be seen everywhere along the creek.  The good news is that this geologic action created a treasure trove of crystals to be found with a little effort. Mica (clear to black), Garnet(ruby red to burnt orange), Tourmaline(black and brown), Kyanite(sky blue) and others minerals are everywhere.  So, it is a great place to go with a bucket, strainer, geo hammer and eye protection. \n\nBe careful after rains, as the Wissahikon Creek becomes savage and swells to several times its normal flow for many hours after the storm passes.  While the scour it causes reveals more riches, it can also quickly take a life.  Don't go alone. \n\nThis is some of the finest 1,800 acres of park land you will see east of the Mississippi.",

Although the Inn named for his most daring plan feels like it might have been around to provide succor to our troops, it actually came later.  Still, if patriotic memories served with drink and sustenance are your thing, the Washington Crossing Inn will make you a very satisfied customer.  The place just feels so authentic and historically grounded that it is impossible not to have at least a moment of reflection about the birth of our nation fought and died for all around on this hallowed ground.  \n\nOn a quiet Friday eve in August, when many were far away on vacation or at the shore, the WCI provides a nurturing and comfortable abode for a well made libation to accompany an equally crafted conversation.  We sat at the bar catching up on too infrequently overlapping lives, me enjoying a Padron Margarita Up No Salt.  It was tart, smooth and strong, without ice to dilute, nor salt to dry the lips.  It was so good I anticipated the second long before I was close to finishing the first.  The conversation became poignant, and my hunger asserted itself, so we agreed to move to a nearby hightop to enjoy a tavern meal as we imbibed and edged closer to the heart of our exchange.  \n\nMy Tavern Burger was very good with Red Onion, Tomato, and Lettuce ensconced in a fresh Kaiser Roll.

Together, the Rita and Burger were a perfect complement to unexpectedly meaningful evening.  \n\nFor facilitating this exceptional moment in a wonderfully ambient historic environment, I genuinely felt this was as good as it gets.

    "text": "Riverside, NJ, is no longer the thriving Delaware River side town it was in the middle of the last century. Scott Avenue is still a wide expanse well designed for Independence and Veterans Day parades, but the storefronts on either side are now either boarded up or operating as low budget businesses working hard to survive in this dusty backwater now that its industrial base is gone. That is, except for the Golden River Restaurant. \n\nTheir building has been standing for over one hundred years, taking many forms from drug store to early age department store and appliance outlet. Since about 1992 it has been a restaurant, most recently in its present form as a breakfast/lunch emporium. I stopped in after court in Mt. Holly to see what they had going on. \n\nIt is a large room with booths and tables up front and an old lunch counter in back. It feels dated, yet comfortable - quietly fitting into the over the hill sensibility of Riverside itself. I took a stool at the counter and was immediately approached by a very friendly server offering Lacas Coffee and a menu. People were shorter a century ago, and I discovered that I could not fit my legs under the counter. I moved over to the end of the row where there was a bit more room due to warpage and a bent stool frame. Fit my 6' 4\" fine there. \n\nI ordered their Greek Omelette with rye toast, and suggested the chef put the home fries inside the egg case along with the onions, peppers, mushrooms, sausage, feta and whatever else was in there. In the meantime I sipped my joe and chatted with my counter lady and other customers. Everyone was talkative and willing to share their thoughts. Cool! \n\nMy breakfast was delicious and filling. The eggs were still wet enough to meld with its filling, allowing each element to speak in its own voice, yet harmonize perfectly together. It was definitely a case where the whole was greater than the sum of its parts. A splash of hot sauce completed the dish, adding a touch of heat to the rest of the opus. The rye had crunchy texture and sourness, exactly as I like. This was a strong candidate for omelette of the year. \n\nAs I departed the chef/owner met me at the door to ask after my satisfaction. He was pleased with my reply. Turns out that he had spent years in Trenton and knew many of the same restaurants and lawyers from the capital city where my office is located. A pleasant surprise. \n\nI congratulated him on his success in Riverside, and reminded him that his employee at the counter deserved a raise. \n\nHope she gets it.",

That was nearly 25 years ago when the station, though still beautiful in its faded glory, struggled to maintain its class and dignity in a city that had fallen on hard times. Walking through the grand center hall was like a stroll in an ancient temple paying homage to the greatness of a bygone age. (Please read my earlier review for a flavor of its history.)\n\nThese days the station has been refurbished and renewed beautifully. It has returned to its former grandeur and it could be said it is even better now than ever. The expanded food court is an example of this improvement across the board. The entire south side of the station houses a multitude of fast and fast casual eateries, cafes and bakeries that are as attractive to sit in as their products are tasty to eat and drink. It reminds of the amazing food court that was rebirthed at Union Station in Washington, DC, a few decades ago. \n\n30th Street is now both a high functioning contemporary transportation center and a \"Please Touch\" museum in the heart of America's first capital city. It has become a destination for rail travellers, city dwellers and visitors far and wide. \n\nEven parking has been streamlined and made safe and affordable. Picking up my son coming in from Latrobe on The Pennsylvanian, I was able to park across the street, take the walking bridge to the station using the smooth escalators, and be waiting for him at Track 7 as he emerged from the beneath the station platform, in just minutes.",

The chew blended ingredients well and gave full voice to the harmonics exploding in my mouth. Alas, my tastes have matured to appreciate the pleasure of the different texture. There is a place in life for more than one variety of bagel. \n\nBagel Wisdom attained by hard experience and exhaustive bagel research cannot be denied.",

    "text": "Completed in Montgomery County in 2015, Pennypack Trail is actually 16 miles long (5.4 mi. in Montco), and part of the much larger trail network in eastern PA. In fact, the section extending into Bucks County reaches the Delaware River and connects with the East Coast Greenway which runs 3,000 miles from Maine to Florida. So, if you want a long hike, you can have one. \n\nThe portion I was on yesterday was the border of Lorimer Park that was historically the railroad right of way since the 1860s, when first the Philadelphia Montgomery County Railroad Co., followed by the Philadelphia Newtown New York Railroad and finally the Newtown Branch of the Reading R&R used it to transport people and produce before highways took their place. SEPTA had it last and suspended commuter transportation (Fox Chase - Newtown Line) in 1983, and donated it to the Rails to Trails Project. \n\nWhile we all love a scenic walk, it sure would be nice to have mass transit available to get us from our bedroom communities to the heart of the city more conveniently, and redevelop the termini and old stations along the route for small commerce, too. There should be a way to have both more green space and village like economies working in tandem to attract people. Vision and capital are all that are required. \n\nStill, the Trail is a beautiful route for nature and scenic lovers as it is, and can be enjoyed in almost any weather. Walking along the heights above Pennypack Creek and watching the water course through the steep ravine cut out by erosion over eons of time, is remarkable. In the 18th and 19th Centuries many mills were busy using water wheels to grind flour, which was transported by the nearby rails to cities for further production and consumption. Some of those old structures are still there (mostly in ruins), and the stone houses built near to them were often maintained and are lived in today. \n\nHiking further, the Bethayres Swamp beckons, with Audubon designation as an IBA - Important Bird Area. The trail goes through the town of Bryn Athyn, where the original train station has been repurposed as the local post office. Just beyond that is the site of a major head-on train collision in 1921, that killed many passengers. Not all the trail is smooth for bike riding, nor easy strolling, but with effort, grit and good footwear, these places can be reached, explored and fancied.\n\nThe Pennypack Watershed is an ecological zone with long human history in the Philadelphia area. It is well worth sustaining and maintaining, even with reasonable respect for progress and our shared future.",

The crowd is quite different than who you see at breakfast and lunch.  It seems like many of Micha's friends come down to hang out with her.  They bring wine or harder stuff for all to share, and often pick up a mix of desserts to pass around.  Sort of like a pot luck. \n\nThis is a great direction for this small house.

This year the choice was the new Metro Diner in the spot where the Wells Fargo Bank used to be in the corner of Lincoln Plaza Shopping Center. \n\nThe place was a buzzing half full house, with full complement of cooks and service personnel putting the \"fast\" in Metro's fast casual dining. The Roasted Turkey Platter (3 large slices of white meat, blanched green beans, stuffing, mashed potatoes & gravy) were placed steaming hot before me five minutes after ordering. It was all very good, and the included slice of pumpkin pie with dollop of whipped cream, the perfect alternative to the DIY option. The $15 per person charge gives \"lazy\" a good name. \n\nThese guys were closing at 2 to give staff time with family.\n\nWe went on to visit friends after their dinners and celebrated all we had to be thankful for for the remainder of the day.",

    "text": "Is this the best Italian restaurant in Newtown? I think so.\n\nIs it the best in Bucks?  I could make an argument for it, but the real point is that it is so good that people who love Italian should give it a try. Back in the day I returned to Trenton to satisfy my Napoli needs, but those days are gone, and we all must find alternatives closer to home.\n\nPasquale is the owner/chef/creative genius of Vecchia Osteria.  He takes great pride in his cuisine, and oversees the details between being on the floor checking on his customers and making everyone feel welcome.  He can be generous.  Complimentary glasses of wine and cannoli are not uncommon.  In between, the courses are excellent and each taste follows on upon the one before building into a crescendo of taste, texture, and subtle overlay.  Maestro, please continue. \n\nLast week, VO was one of several local eateries to donate dishes a for large dinner in town.  They provided Chicken Cacciatore (white version), and Rigatoni Vodka, enough for 60 people.  The Chicken was dark meat with lots of Rosemary covering everything.  The meat and bone were easily parted, leaving a succulent light wine and vinegar sauce to bathe the dark chicken flavors.  It was superb.  The pasta was the larger rigatoni, which held the creamy tomato gravy in its grooves and ridges like they were born together.  It was a subtle tone so as not to compete with the more robust cacciatore.  Great combination.  I was sure to take some leftovers home to enjoy the next day, as Chicken Cacciatore becomes even more satisfying with age. \n\nI have eaten in Pasquale's house several times, and always wondered why I waited so long to return.  \n\nIt always exceeds my expectations.",

No, it isn't as big and old as the one in Manhattan, nor as historic with twisted alleys as San Francisco's, but for being 175 years old it has its own gritty exotic charm with good restaurants, shops and second story businesses that keep this commercial center thriving. The original Chinese zone was much larger than the core 5 city blocks between Race and Arch, but the demands for land for the Ben Franklin Bridge, Convention Center, Vine Street Expressway, Round House, and Federal Detention Center, have carved up the neighborhood to what we see today. Luckily growth is happening to the north to Callowhill Street, and the south around Washington Street. \n\nI am there once or twice a month to shop in the basement grocery for Chinese ingredients I can't find in the burbs, to get a haircut, and have lunch or dinner at one of the dozens of kitchens offering cuisine from all over China. If my sweet tooth is active, there are now bakeries, bubble tea and Thai ice cream shops galore. \n\nThe Friendship Gate on 10th Street is worth walking under to capture the magic carved and painted into it by artisans from Tianjin. \n\nParking is always an issue, so if you live in center city, walk or Uber over. Otherwise, be prepared to pay for space on the edges of C'town that add to the cost of an otherwise inexpensive experience.",

The meet up at Tired Hands Fermentaria was my first opportunity to visit this well known brewery in Ardmore, Pa., and to sample its wares.  I've got to say that sitting at a table with about 20 peeps, surrounded by the acoustically challenged corrugated iron-roofed warehouse and close to the stainless steel fermenting tanks where the magic is done, made for a loud amplified afternoon. Yet, sitting with folks that I look forward to seeing, and the new ones that I am about to meet, made it bearable. \n\nArriving late, I was still in time to find a seat and order a Shamabalac mystical ale and a veggie Banh Mi wrap.  Our server was cool and competent, keeping everyone in suds and sustenance, while allowing us to maintain separate tabs.  Quite a trick that she handled with aplomb. \n\nThe drink was blond and had remarkable fruity notes.  Liked it, and ordered a couple more. The Vietnamese interpreted sandwich was hardly banh mi at all, given that it was in a wheat wrap rather than a French baguette.  True, the daikon, carrot, tofu and siriracha were present, but the concept was wrong.  Better to just called it Vietnamese inspired, and leave it at that. It was okay, but the image in my head was abandoned unfilled. \n\nTruth be told, I am not a beer maven, although I enjoy it in small creative doses.  Bourbon is my downfall.  Still, I see what people like about Tired Hands, and brewery clubs in general.  The capacity crowd on this late Saturday afternoon, certainly did, too.",

I did clean my hands before touching the keyboard.  \n\nKing of Falafel in the Newtown Farmers' Market is very close to the main entrance, requiring a right turn past the pretzel stand, and then it is right in front of you.  It offers all manner of Middle Eastern/Greek delicacies from Fresh Feta and Olives to Stuffed Grape Leaves and Baklava.  It is all very good.  Today, I wanted a Falafel Pita.  I quickly brought it back to my office to devour, as the dining area was crowded with the lunchers.  \n\nAs I unwrapped the aluminum foil the aroma of hot chickpeas and tachina wafted over me.  My salivaries reacted immediately, and I had to swallow hard to regain control.  The first bite penetrated the warm pita, sliced through a falafel ball, and diced the lettuce easily.  The flavor of fresh ground chickpeas dominated the oral sensations, but the tachina sauce quickly caught up with its own sesame subtleties.  The mix was fresh and insisted I pay attention.  The falafel was well fried (not over done) with little oily taste and a hint of gentle sweetness, while the tachina took it all in a different, slightly sour direction.\n\n  It was great!  It took me back to the Souk in Jerusalem where I had first tried the varieties of things that could be stuffed onto a pita and rolled up as a twenty something student at Tel Aviv University.  My reverie ended, but as I went to toss away the recyclable remains, I noticed something else in the bag.  It was a single piece of Baklava thrown in as a final sweet ending by the owners. Nice surprise!   My lips are still sticky.  The philo dough, grounds nuts, and honey were a wonderful end to an enjoyable lunch break and time travel experience.  \n\nI will make new travel reservations soon as the Newtown Farmers' Market is only open 3 days a week.  \n\nAll aboard!",

With early 20th Century elevated subway (the El) rumbling above the shadowed street below, it can be difficult to see any hope of renewal. Yet, a closer look shows seeds germinating in the cracks in the sidewalk. \n\nThe 3900 block has several Southeast Asian restaurants that are more than just surviving, but thriving in this unforgiving environment. Vietnamese, Lao, Chinese and Thai kitchens are turning out some of the best cuisine in the city. I drove down last weekend to explore some of the possibilities, and selected Vientiane Bistro as my starting point. \n\nRight next door to the well known Cafe Pho Ga Thanh Thanh, the Bistro is nicely renovated with utilitarian metal furniture, plank floors and simple wall decorations. The aroma of lemongrass, ginger and garlic greeted me at the door, quickly followed by the attractive, friendly server pointing me to a deuce in front along the side wall. She returned with menu a moment later. She was unaware that there was also a lunch list and when I inquired, she confirmed with the owner that it was available as well. She retrieved one promptly. My Yelp research paid off, giving me a chance to sample a few smaller portions of more dishes; Lao style dim sum .\n\nCoconut Soup, Veggie Spring Roll, Chicken Pad Kee Mao (Drunken Noodles) and Tamarind Wings appetizer, were soon being prepared by their talented chef. I was about to be entertained by a four act play. \n\nThe soup was mildly sweet, full of veggies and a nice place to start. Loved every slurp and picked up the bowl to drain every drop. The six Tamarind Wings were large, grilled and bathed in a dark rouge/amber thick tart glaze. After the soup, it presented a very different taste and texture. A lover of tamarind duck, this was a great counterpoint and subtle reminder of that favorite. The Spring Roll was the weak link, but with the sweet dipping sauce was more of a bridge to what came next. I asked for the Pad Kee Mao to be done \"extra spicy.\" That was what I got. Each bite of the veggies, chicken and broad noodles ignited my lips, gums and tongue with a pleasant burn, that gradually increased as I worked my way down the large mound in the wide bowl. Never numbing, I felt as much as tasted every morsel. Special surprise at the bottom of the bowl, where all the oils and spices collected and covered the last few pieces of food. I knew I probably shouldn't, but I couldn't resist spooning all of that into my mouth. \n\nHoly cow! It was a hot blast that brought tears to my eyes and blew out my sinuses. Tears of joy, I assure you. Should have asked for more napkins, but it all ended well. \n\nThe influence of Lao and Thai cuisine on each other is wonderful. The hybrid creates a flavor/texture profile that connects the delicacy of Thai sauces with the heavier heartiness of Lao cooking. That is a beautifully delicious thing and a place that I could live happily forever.",

Up here, it is still possible to buy a townhouse for south of $100 grand, and catch the train to Suburban Station from Torresdale Septa stop. You can live among folks who have roots that go back generations, and fit in as a newbie welcomed to the hood. It is possible to find your pioneer spirit in the 21st. \n\nAnd, when you explore a little, you can find places like Athenian Diner on Torresdale Avenue that has been slinging excellent hash & eggs for over 50 years at the same row house location. Walking in and taking a counter stool immediately alerts you that some things just never change. The breakfast dishes are excellent. The waitresses have been there since at least the turn of the century, and they make you feel right at home with their first smile and easy urban offhand manner. Yes. You can eat the atmosphere; it is that timeless. \n\nI sat at the end of the counter across from the Bunn-O-Matic. My white mug of joe arrived quickly, and my request for milk over creamer was met with a short glass of moo juice just for me. Greek diner required a Greek breakfast, and the Greek Omelet seemed the only way to go. Tomato, onion, green pepper, & feta mixed with two eggs and a side of home fries, presented as beautifully to the eye as it was to the tastebuds. Rye toast with a touch of butter completed the ensemble. It was delicious. I love that salty tartness of feta blended with the more subtle savoriness of the onion/tomato mix. Even the potatoes fit in nicely, although I did leave some of them behind to save on calories. Didn't need nor miss that third egg, at all. \n\nI parked on a side street to avoid the meters, and to build a walk into the experience. It was obvious that despite some economic development on this main street, that Tacony still had a long way to go before it became an upscale desirable address. In many ways, that truth made it all the more attractive.",

I was a customer of that antique urban store, and loved their breakfast sandwiches, especially the sausage, egg and cheese creation. The old grill in the back room turned out many a delicious meal. \n\nSo, when I saw that the new place had a morning menu including a SEC sammy, I know the temptation to explore that offering would be too great to let me stay away for long. \n\nAnd, so it was. I walked in today after finding a parking spot open in front. The room looked the same as the first cafe, but with interesting artwork on the walls, and a very pleasant crew of baristas handling the preparations on the polished stainless Expresso maker. I asked for the sandwich and large coffee, and looked around while waiting for it to be completed. Clean and well maintained. \n\nI watched as one of the women made my bagel sandwich on the small grills on the back shelf. Double meat. Double soft fried egg. Double cheese. She and I had a brief conversation about how Trenton had changed over the years (not all for the better, we agreed), but certainly with new life springing up in the shadows of this former \"All American City.\" She constructed the layers of ingredients and nicely packaged it for my trip down the street to the office. That sticky decal with the cafe's logo was a very nice touch. \n\nSaving the best for last, the sandwich was among the best desayunos I've had the pleasure to consume. It was loaded, and each bite an explosion of tastes and textures, as my teeth slices through it. Amazing how exponentially better doubling the contents made the dish. A bagel is leaky by design, but it wasn't so extrusive as to require extreme caution. Yes, my fingers were involved in picking up all that fell out. It was all too good to waste. The coffee was a medium roast that continues to hold its flavor without bitterness to this very moment. \n\nAt five minutes from the office, Palo de Azucar is too good to not become a regular morning stop. The sandwich so reminded me of the old guy cooking in the backroom, that it was almost like he was still around. \n\nGreat way to commemorate the great grandfather of the shop by allowing his spirit to shine through.",

Sometimes my curiosity gets me in trouble cuisine-wise, but this day it led me to a wonderful discovery. Pat's F.T. was all that, and about the best I had eaten in the past year. \n\nMy white oval plate arrived with two slices of average sized bread, dipped in egg slurry with vanilla extract, sugar/cinnamon mix and grilled expertly to reveal caramelized nooks and crannies, and then topped with sliced juicy kiwi and blueberries. A dusting of sugar/cinnamon finished the   presentation. It looked great, a sensibility only surpassed by it amazing taste. \n\nFirst bite was was a five star riot. The combination of ingredients was both a textural and flavor banquet for the tongue and soul. How this was created in the tiny kitchen behind the dining room may never be fully discovered. It sent a shock wave through me and woke the deeper recesses of my brain. This dish was something very special. The cook explained that they were out of the expected strawberry and banana garnish, and that he worked with what he had. Kiwi was soft and sweet, while the blueberry, plump with exquisite pulp. It was a winner all the way around.\n\nAlthough not my usual stamping ground, this stretch of Brownsville Road has a number of very good restaurants hidden in this older part of southern Bucks. It is now even more worthwhile to return to find out what other pleasant surprises come out of Pat's kitchen.",

    "text": "This second generation pizza shop on Bristol Road, was a surprising find last week. Housed in one of the old strip commercial buildings, it has the benefit of low rents to keep their prices very reasonable, as well as recipes handed down from parents to kids that have stood the test of time as being what people love to eat when thinking traditional Italian-American cuisine. The walls of the dining room are full of old family photos in black and white that add to the ambiance of this vintage pizza parlor.\n\nI settled into one of their three booths to await a single slice appetizer and 12\" Mixed Sweet/Hot Sausage, Pepper & Onion Sammy. I could hear the kitchen folk chatting away and banging pans and oven doors as they prepared takeout orders along with mine. \n\nThe regular slice (well done) arrived first. It was a little heavy with cheese and dripping oil, but the first bite was still crisp with nicely charred undercarriage and very good red sauce. It was better than it looked. The sausage P&O likewise didn't look like a work of art, but when the sauce was dripped on top, it came alive with great flavor, texture and interplay amongst the ingredients and torpedo roll. The sausage mix demonstrated it may have been locally produced, from the freshness of the chew and subtlety of the flavors. In any event, it was an exceptional; a best of breed for me this year. \n\nI hear the Sarappo family has another restaurant in Croydon, PA. It is now bookmarked for future exploration.",

    "text": "Father's Day Brunch @ Blue Sage Vegetarian Grille (everyone knows it as Blue Sage), was the epitome of a meal that makes a wonderful day nearly perfect.  \n\nWhile I have dined there several times over the years, it had fallen off my circuit at some point for no particular reason.  When my 12 year old wanted to take me out for a good meal for Father's Day, Blue Sage came to mind.  I called at 10:00 on Sunday morning and was fortunate to secure a table for 2:30 that afternoon.  By no stretch am I a vegetarian, but I do enjoy a tasty healthy meal at any time.  \n\nWe arrived a couple of minutes late after canoeing in Tyler State Park ran a little long (that's another story), and were seated promptly.  The staff was friendly and knowledgeable. The brunch menu is a shorter version of the regular menu with several specials thrown in. It's a one from Page One and one from Page Two deal for $18., including organic coffee.  \n\nI ordered the Corn Johnnie Cakes with Berries and the Relleno.  The Cakes looked like four small dark pancakes topped with Strawberries and Blueberries.  It was pulled together with a Sweet Cream Butter whip that was just sweet enough, but did not interfere with the berry flavors, nor the hot corn cakes.  It was delicious.  The Relleno was a Red Pepper stuffed with mild melted cheese, beans, onions and red/orange cherry tomatoes.  It was finished with a tawny copper colored tangy sauce that made me glad I had a spoon so I could claim every drop.  I was completely satisfied.  My son had two different dishes of Sweet Rice Pudding balls and Mashed Potato Empanadas which he enjoyed. They were filled with red pepper pumpkin seed pesto mixed with the potato, and it came with Giant White Beans pickled, Gazpacho Sauce, and a Tomato - Avocado Salad. I know this because he only reluctantly allowed me to taste them. \n\nThis would have been a delectable meal on any day of the year.  That is culminated Father's Day for me makes it vastly more memorable.  I will be sure to consider Blue Sage on my list of \"go to\" places on special occasions.  It was a great place to complement a great day.",

    "text": "It is really nice to have expectations exceeded by a local slow/fast food shop. That was exactly what happened yesterday when we visited Curly's Comfort Food in Levittown, PA. \n\nWhy \"slow/fast\"? Because although Curly does cheesesteaks, burgers, chicken and all the accessories, which are typically considered fast food; it is so slammed with people ordering and waiting for their food that the first thing the ordertaker said to me was that there was a one hour wait for pickup. After ordering their Diablo Cheesesteak with fried onions, Firecracker Crisp Chicken Sandwich and standard Burger, she asked for my phone number to be able to alert me when the kitchen had prepared everything. Well, okay. We walked across the parking field to the H Mart for a little casual shopping in that well stocked Asian market. \n\nAll the reviews suggesting the Curly's cheesesteak is the best of breed in the region. That is no lie! My son opened a zoftig sesame seeded long torpedo roll with enough thin sliced beef, cheese, jalapenos, and onions to fill at least two regular sized 'steaks.' He cut off a two inch end of the massive creation for me to taste, and he still couldn't finish it. My small sampling left me wanting more. It was a perfect roll wrapped around a glorious mix of deliciously delivered ingredients, complete with raw onion and sliced tomato. \n\nSimply stunning! \n\nThe Firecracker Chicken wasn't far behind. Breaded and deep fried, it was a large breast with strong spice content, mayo, lettuce and tomato. I felt sorry for the round Kaiser roll attempting to hold it all together. It really couldn't, so before I was half way through it, I grabbed a knife and fork to assist. It was also excellent, and an unspoken contender in the chicken sandwich wars being waged by the franchises. Watch out, Popeye's and Chik-Fil-A! \n\nThe burger was the simplest on the menu, but still a half pounder surrounded by a copious load of pretty good fries, in the same Kaiser roll, with the requested medium finish. Who ever heard of a takeout joint paying enough attention at the grill to deliver the right doneness? Curly did! \n\nSure, the bill for all this quantity and quality was in the mid $40s. As I paid with that 3% credit card surcharge, I hoped it would all be worthwhile. Truth is that it was worth every penny and perhaps more, although that surcharge is obnoxious, and they would be doing a civic service to eliminate that, as it discriminates against the majority of consumers who are part of our credit economy.\n\nPRO TIP - You have to ask them to switch the Diablo Chicken Steak to a Beef version which was not on the paper menu. It costs a little more, but definitely the way to go.",

    "text": "The Stuff'd Bunz food trailer was set up outside the Newtown Brewery last weekend. The two women inside were constructing a variety of sliders (see menu photo) at $4 per. We ordered a Pulled Chicken composition and Philly Cheesesteak Sammy on the way out of the beer den after purchasing a 4-pack of home grown suds. \n\nWhile the Belgian Tripel went of $23, the amazingly tasty sliders were boxed expertly for $8 for a deuce, prepared the way you want it. Ample sauces, peppers, onions, relishes and melty cheese to beat the band. When we arrived home five minutes later, we broke open the grub and brew at the kitchen table and went off devouring the solids and guzzling the liquids. \n\nReally, the Stuff'd Bunz were terrific; plenty of flavors and textures to entertain the tastebuds, and leave you wanting more. Strong BBQ base under sours and sweets and crunchies, held together by something that reminded of a potato bun. Even the mock Cheesesteak was a big chew hoot and a half. Gooey cheese over finely chopped beef, with onion mixed in. Not the Prince of Steaks, but a damn good facsimile. \n\nWashed all that down with the expensive amber ale, and we were sated, if not poorer for the experience. When Covid is defeated, I look forward to hanging out at the bar and enjoying the wonderful repast to the fullest. Until then, takeaway is the only safe way to go.",

    "text": "A shiny new state of the art garage door opener is not my usual birthday present, but in this Age of Covid when remaining home has become a virtue, it will do until something sexier comes along. The Liftmaster Model 8835 is a thing of beauty after all. \n\nMy old Genie finally gave up the ghost last week. There are no parts in stock anymore, so the only option was full replacement. Amazing how little has really changed in the world of remote door lifters. True, this one uses a band drive rather than a chain, but those are still available. Yet new tech seemed the way to go, along with built in WiFi that allows door control from a long distance through a smart phone. So, for $525 I upgraded to the modern variant of the old standard. Could have had battery backup for a buck twenty five more, but since there was a manual override, that wasn't necessary. \n\nCarl arrived right on time at 1:58 p.m. Exactly one hour later he was handing me the two remotes and explaining how the outside digital code pad worked. He was quick, focused and obviously had been installing these babies for a long time. He was also able to carry on a good dialogue all the while. \n\nSo, now I have a quiet half horse door lifter, complete with dual lights, WiFi, outside keypad, electric eye safety stop and two remotes. I feel a chill down my spine as the motor purrs and pulls the four panel door up and down. \n\nThat's more than most gifts do for me.",

    "text": "Szechuan House remains one of my favorite Chinese restaurants in the Mercer/Bucks region. While it doesn't have everything nailed down in terms of consistency of flavor and presentation, it makes a strong statement for traditional Szechuan cuisine. They recently reopened after a lengthy renovation, and although the vibe is the same, it does appear cleaner on the dining room floor and likely in the kitchen, too. \n\nWhile food from Chengdu and Chongqing is more common here these days than it was decades ago, it remains an acquired taste for most consumers with its heavy hot chili spice and oil content. It is nothing like the sweeter Cantonese offerings found in Chinese American joints across the continent. For me the shift to preferring the numbing black peppercorns and flaming small red chillies over General Tso and the rest, came from my prolonged exposure to the kitchen heat during eight years I spent working and exploring the Middle Kingdom, primarily in Szechuan and Yunnan provinces. For me, eating this style food brings me back to the adventurous days when I became acculturated to this cooking, and loved life there. \n\nI would never say this is the best representation of Szechuanese cuisine in the western world, but it is damn good and satisfying. Yes, part of its attraction for me is reminiscing about the past, and they do need to use more peppercorns to capture the numbing elements of what I like most, but unless I want to travel to China to satisfy my yearnings, Szechuan House is about as good as it gets for the gestalt I seek. \n\nPS. Yes, Philly has some very strong candidates - Han Dynasty, Chili Szechuan, Chengdu Famous, Four Rivers and Ermi, among the best - they are not appreciably superior to S.H., although I love them all.",

    "text": "I returned to Szechuan House, the hidden treasure of a restaurant found on Rt. 33 in Hamilton Township, Mercer County, New Jersey, for another mouth numbing meal last week.  The last time I was there I underwent a root canal the next day without need of additional anesthesia.  It was that good! \n\nYes. This is a joke, but you might not think it funny if you don't take the warning seriously. If you are thinking \"Mexican\" spicy, you are in for a rude awakening.  Szechuan spicy is an entirely different dimension of heat.  I love Jalapenos and Habaneros, and even Ghost Peppers, and you can pile them onto my Flautas without me blinking.  Put an equivalent amount of Szechuan peppercorns, hot chili oil, and those cute little red Chinese peppers into a dish, and your review goes from 5 Star to 5 Alarm.\n  \nI love it, but it is an acquired taste. As someone said about this style food, \"Numb is a flavor.\"\n \nLast week, I was surrounded by Dan Dan Noodles with Minced Pork and Chili Vinaigrette, Steamed Dumplings with Chili Vinaigrette, Amazing Eggplant (that's the name), and Hunan Beef.  \n\nThe Dan Dan's were spaghetti diameter, and had a nice ground pork sauce with a mild spicy quotient.  Very tasty and a nice start to the meal. (4 Star/3 Alarm)\n\nThe Steamed Dumplings with Chili Vinaigrette was found in the Szechuan Delicacies part of the menu toward the back page.  Six fairly large, hand stuffed and pinched, with the red chili oil and vinegar for a bath. There was a pleasant sweetness that I experienced before the heat arrived. Not sure how that was done, but it played well on my tongue. (5 Star/4 Alarm)\n\nThe Amazing Eggplant came on a large plate piled with the thin Chinese Eggplant, in a brown, spicy sauce with a light meat base.  This was delicious and stole the show. Tender, medium heat, and addictive. (5 Star/3 Alarm)\n\nHunan Beef came with an equal supply of broccoli in a shining brown Hunanese sauce.  The beef was thin sliced and very tender.  The Chinese chilies swam in the sauce at the bottom of the serving bowl.  Solid choice, if not completely inspiring.\n(4 Star/ 3 Alarm).\n\nThis was a totally satisfying meal, reminding me of my Chengdu daze.  The 5 Alarm dishes were not selected this time as my friends were not accustomed to Szechuan cuisine, and they needed to be broken in slowly.  But, if you are ready for the HEAT, I suggest the Fish Fillet in Hot & Spicy Sauce, the Diced Rabbit with Szechuan Peppercorn Vinaigrette (a cold dish with serious hot), or the Beef in Hot & Spicy Sauce to begin your Vulcan adventure.",

High burn with every crunchy morsel. Just below numb on the volcanic scale, perhaps not reaching conflagration due to the meager presence of Szechuan black peppercorns and reliance on red chillies to cover for their absence, but still excellent. \n\nThe Crispy Fish Fillets Sweet & Sour was a large deep platter full of lightly fried fish and loads of orangey thick sauce. More Cantonese, but a strong interpretation. Really liked it in the face of all the other flames. \n\nThe few other plates were good, but not worth taking up more space here in light of all the other fireball delights found in this still surprisingly authentic Chengdu palace.",

    "text": "When my last order of locally roasted coffee beans was about to run out, I looked around online for other bean purveyors to sample. Liberty City Roasters in Bristol, PA, jumped out with a website that exuded passion for their craft. Last Friday I ordered Yirgacheffe and Peruvian 8 oz. bags, drip grind, @ $8.95 per, plus a reasonable shipping charge. They were on my doorstep Saturday afternoon, and brewing in our autodrip Sunday morning. This was quite amazing for a small company, and I suspect that someone in management drove it over to us on his way home from work. \n\nGotta love that level of personal service! \n\nWe regularly buy fresh roasted beans, and have adapted our pantry to hold the coffee in our own containers for longer storage. We customize each by cutting and affixing the labels from the roaster to our jars when received so we always know what we are drinking and take pride in our handiwork. \n\nI've now sipped mugs of both, and can report on my experience. Yirgacheffe is a smaller bean (a/k/a Peaberry), from south central Ethiopia in a micro region of the Sidamo area. The hot days/cool nights at 7,000 feet above sea level are perfect conditions for producing mellow java. This coffee is great in a light to medium roast. It is mildly acidic and gentle on the tongue. It taste clean with a flavor of berries, lemon and perhaps, sweet peanut. Some say a hint of coconut emerges under certain roasting, but I don't know about that. Still, this is my favorite coffee overall, and our beans are an excellent example from the birthplace of coffee. \n\nThese Peruvian beans are similarly expertly roasted to allow peak enjoyment of its java. Its juice is more acidic that the Yirgacheffe, and has a stronger taste, but remains smooth and soft on the pallet. It has a light flavor of  fig, cherry and maybe a touch of peach undertone. It was balanced and lithe. My first encounter was fun and memorable. \n\nAt $8.95 for 8oz, the price was reasonable and only a small premium over mass produced coffee, even those bagged variants with well known names that still roast by the ton, not small batch. \n\nVery impressive first take.",

The front door was locked for non-members, but everyone knew that the world was invited.  Just wait for someone to open the door and go in.  Put your first name on the legal pad in the foyer and wait for it to be called.  In the meantime, pour yourself a mug of hot coffee (on the house), and look around.  There's a bakery in the corner with good looking housemade goodies, and T Shirts for sale with their logo House Labrador Retriever.  Check out the wood burning stove, and look out the large windows at the Mighty Delaware and Lambertville, NJ across the narrow truss bridge.  Plenty to keep you entertained while you wait for one of the 31 stools around the large room to become available.  Even on this crowded morn, we had adjoining spinners in about 20 minutes.  That's just the first act.\n\nThe menu is pretty much standard morning fare, with the major exception that everything is made in house.  Very tempting to try old standards and see what Fred's does with them.  So, we ordered Scrambled Eggs & Corned Beef Hash, and a Ham, Egg & Cheese on English Muffin.  The second came with a side of Hash Browns.  This is more or less a French kitchen, where everything is prepared in front of you.  It is easy to watch the staff do its thing, from making pancake batter, to buttering the toast.  Everyone knows their job and there is constant movement and teamwork.\n\nMy Corned Beef Hash was far more colorful than the normal variants.  This one had multi-colored peppers sliced into the mix, along with onion, potato and the meat.  The freshness was outstanding, and the taste a delight to my taste buds.  The scrambled were nothing special, but with a splash of hot sauce they were fine.  The English muffin was supersized and full of nooks and crannies.  It held its contents well, despite the load of sliced grilled ham, fried egg and American cheese.  Strong flavor along with the crunch.  Thomas's could learn a thing or two about improving their product.  The hash browns were plentiful and well cooked, with enough dark nibs and tenderness to be a textural as well as a tasteful side. \n\nThe house closes at 11.  Plan accordingly.",

    "text": "Imli (Tamarind) Indian Kitchen sits on Passyunk Avenue just a few blocks north of Washington.  It is in one of the few strips along this diagonal thoroughfare that is not very commercially developed.  The upside is there is usually street parking to be found nearby.  The down, is that Imli does not benefit from being around other choices for potential customers.  It stands on its own, an excellent South Indian house that is very worth finding. If you live in the neighborhood you have the best of both worlds; the relative quietude of living in a gentrifying residential area, and a great place to walk to for a superior South Asian repast.  Lucky you!\n\nEarly Sunday evening there was only one couple dining when we entered.  First impressions were very favorable, with odd angles due to its placement on a narrow point of the star caused by transecting streets; dark wooden and slate hues on walls and floors offering a cool vibe to chill the heat coming from the curry kitchen, and large storefront windows on the urban world, made shade from mature street trees. Two young women approached with smiles and menus in hand, and invited us to sit anywhere. We selected the front corner table with a view of the streetscape without, and the whole room within.  These ladies were definitely sisters, and they admitted to kinship with the owners.  \n\nAs firsttimers, we ordered a cross section of the offerings: Chicken 65 for an app; Began Bhurta (veggie curry dish), and Chicken Korma (mildly sweet and loudly hot at the same time). The house put down a plate with Papadum and two dipping sauces, which was a nice gesture. Garlic Naan, Mango Lassi and Chai completed the symphony. The \"65\" dish came out deep red and slightly crispy.  It was a delicious opening gambit. It was expertly grilled so the tops and edges were near-black, making it visually stunning.  The eggplant (Began Bhurta) came in a deep silver dish and thick curry sauce.  It mixed well with the Basmati Rice and was great for sopping with the Naan.  The Korma arrived in a yogurt/creamy/nutty champagne-colored curry with a nice amount of fresh cut chicken.  Everything was ordered, \"hot,\" and was true to its word.  The lassi and chai helped to reduce the heat as needed, and allowed us to continue through to the end of the meal with calling the fire department.  The Garlic Naan was served flat on a wooden board rather than in a basket (nice touch), and the bowls of rice were more the enough to cover our main dishes.  \n\nI have not been to every other Indian kitchen in Philly, but of the many I have tried in the region, Imli is right up there with the best of them.  It offers a pleasing combination of cool atmosphere, warm, efficient service, and excellent cuisine. It may not be strictly South Indian (who cares), but it certainly knows how to create an unforgettable meal.  \n\nTry to get there soon.",

    "text": "Dredge Harbor sounds like the name of a Stephen King novel, all spooked out for sleepless nights.\n\n It isn't. Rather, it is a small marina on the Jersey side of the Mighty Delaware in Delran, just south of Riverside. The entrance is a bit obscure, and there is a long driveway to be taken until reaching the water. Once the river is before you, hang a left past the huge hanger drydock, being careful to avoid the heavy forklift moving boats in and out. The cafe is the building on the right next to the ramp leading down to the docks. It is an active marina and it is easy to be distracted by the beautiful boats plying the water among the berths.\n\nThis experience is all about outdoor dining. While there is an inside dining area, it has little atmosphere compared to the wide open vistas up and down the river from the overhung patio.  We arrived shortly before 9 am, and were seated at a table within ten minutes.  Coffee flowed, and the menus consisted of traditional breakfast fare from top to bottom.  We opted for a fresh poured and ironed waffle with bacon and a sausage & feta omelet with the home fries thrown inside.  While we waited, we watched the power boats cruising the river and slowly moving around the marina.  It made for a very relaxed and dreamy morning. \n\nThis is one of those adventures where the surroundings trumped the food.  The meals were good, but not more.  My omelet was absolutely loaded with meat, cheese and potatoes, but the sausage links were dry from over-frying, and the eggs could have used a little water in mixing to make them light and fluffy.  The waffle was fine, but would have been so much better with a maple syrup option, rather than the Smucker's corn syrup cheap substitute.  \n\nStill, we really didn't mind the food quality as we mellowed in the moment on the water's edge.  They certainly have the business humming, and don't need to upgrade if they choose not to.  I would come back again regardless, because the environment was so pleasant.  \n\n\"... Summer breeze makes me feel fine.  Blowing through the jasmine in my mind...\"",

    "text": "You know you are in for a treat when the chef/owner comes to your table to discuss what you want for dinner. \n\nLucky for me, my dining buddy was a good friend of DeAnna.  When he mentioned to our server that he should ask her how she prepared a certain pasta dish, the next thing I knew she was standing next to us and embracing my friend.  See photo.  She asked me what I was looking for, and I gave a soft description of something I hoped sounded like Pasta Oglio Olio with Saut\u00e9ed Spinach.  She smiled, offered me a job as relief bartender, and retreated to the kitchen without another word.  Pleasant suspense.  \n\nWhile we waited our Eggplant Marinade app arrived for sharing.  App?  It was enough for a meal in itself.  It was a delicious rendition of thin sliced Eggplant with a rich Red Sauce, and mild taste of Plum Tomato, Rosemary, and Balsamic Vinegar.  Tender, subtle, and nearly melt in my mouth.  Auspicious beginning. \n\nWhen the pasta arrived in its two large white bowls it was not merely the pasta and green I envisioned.  Rather, it was a Star Shaped Profiled Pasta with a Garlic and Oil based sauce that also included the Spinach, Tomato, Green Beans, Crumbled Sweet Italian Sausage, Aged Cheese and maybe a few other things I did not recognize.  \n\nOh, My!  The first bite launched me on a cruise down the Tiber River.  The pasta was soft but its super fresh state deconstructed upon chewing into its constituent elements.  I had seldom experienced pasta so delicate and complex.  The garlic was present, but not overbearing, allowing the Veggies, and Mellow Cheese to harmonize with the textured Sausage and still snappy Beans.  The Tomato provided a tart note.  It was visually stunning to match the celebration of eating. \n\nDeAnna and staff took turns stopping by to see how we were doing. Even the bartender inquired. Quite remarkably, thank you.  \n\nWe shared both dishes, and it was the reasonable thing to do given the volume of each.  The glutton in me had different ideas, but was contented to know it would be easy to return for more.",

    "text": "All reviews are in the end subjective.  Sometimes all the variables are evaluated, but in other instances one aspect so dominates that the other pieces are minimized by comparison.  For me, when the atmosphere of a restaurant so overcomes me with a sense of comfort and well being that the food or service tends to fade quickly, I react emotionally and start to fall in love with the entire experience.  I can't help it. I'm a hopeless romantic. \n\nSo it was with Coffee Cup Caf\u00e9 on Bellevue Avenue, just off one of the ugly parts of business Route 1. I had seen the place for years, but was never tempted to stop and frisk the joint until reading the Yelp reviews.  It seemed like a decent place for breakfast, so I set aside a morning when not too busy to stop in.  \n\nStepping inside after parking on the street in front, I immediately felt the effect of time warping taking me to circa 1980.  An old counter with about 6 or 7 spinners, and large kitchen service window in the wall behind, and more classic coffee mugs hanging on the walls than I could count. There was a nice size dining room to the side, and another tiny one right in front of the building.  Everything white with blue trim.  \n\nThen Beth approached from behind the counter and asked if I wanted coffee.  \"Yes, Mam,\" as I took in her vivacious eyes and well-tatted skin.  Well, all right!  This woman had a story to tell, and I hoped she would share it.  After mentioning this was my first visit, she gave me the history of Coffee Cup Caf\u00e9 back through the early 1970's.  She was second generation ownership, and her son, Jesse, working the kitchen grill would be the third.  She was proud and loud, and she was a groove. She welcomed me to look around, and even step into the galley for a photo. \n\nThe food?  It was just fine.  Coffee hot and fresh.  Breakfast sandwich loaded on a Kaiser roll and able to fill my happy stomach.  I could have hung out there all morning. I felt like a friend and guest of the house.  Some places are just that way.\n\nHow many coffee mugs are found in Coffee Cup Caf\u00e9?  \n\nI'll never tell.",

    "text": "The owners of Pin Wei Chinese Restaurant on S. Henderson Road, King of Prussia, PA, may be Taiwanese, but they have taken the time to understand and produce first quality Szechuanese cuisine in the heart of Montgomery County. They have mastered the mysteries of extremely spicy sauces and cooking techniques that create the unique numbing style that finds its source in the history of Chengdu and Chongqing, China.  There aren't many of these authentic houses around, and when one is found it automatically shoots to the top of the list of great dinner spots.  From the size of the crowd waiting for tables last night, the secret is out. \n\nThis was our first visit, after looking mostly in vain for a Szechuan chili joint that knew what it was doing.  There are a few in Philly, and a couple in nearby Jersey, but by and large, the art of flamethrower dishes is a lost art.  We were very happily impressed with Pin Wei. \n\nWe ordered more than we could finish in one sitting, so we would have enough to take home and enjoy a second time.  Our choices consisted of: Scallion Oil Cucumber as an appetizer, and entrees of Chicken Dry Chili Peppers, Lamb Dry Pot, Twice Cooked Fish, and Deep Fried Longhots. \n\nIn a word; FIRE! \n\nThe cucumbers were served cold and marinating in the clear scallion oil.  Crisp, cool, mildly hot and a great introduction.  The platters arrived as they were finished in the kitchen, not all at once, in the traditional Chinese custom.  The longhots arrived next.  They were beautiful to behold - like dark green snakes coiled on themselves waiting for someone to bite them to release their venom.  Awesome, as each chew released more toxin, burning the gums and walls of the mouth, and bringing tears to the eyes.  Eventually, the scald tempered, and the underlying flavor of these peppers emerged transcendent. \n\nThe chicken dry pepper was a sight to behold, with a huge amount of small red Szechuan chilies, garlic, ginger, onion and small pieces of breaded and twice deep fried chicken mixed throughout.  The chili powder on the morsels was a powerful, sinus clearing, blast.  With every wonderful crunch more capsaicin was released, bringing the mouth to near full numbness.  Got to love that feeling to appreciate its otherworldliness. The lamb dry pot arrived next, and we were thankful for a little relief from the conflagration.  The meat was tender with a gentle sweetness beneath the cumin and other stimulants.  Plenty of mushrooms to absorb the dark sauce at the bottom of the heated metal bowl.  Excellent.\n\nFinally, the twice cooked fish arrived. There was a small glitch when after waiting a while, the wrong dish came to the table - twice cooked pork (belly), which looked good, but, alas, was not what we ordered. Ten more minutes to get the right platter.  It was terrific, saving best for last.  Fish fillets, slightly crisp, yet also soft within, with a dark sauce that hinted of vinegar in addition to the less dominant burning powders.  I had to ask our server what that unusual taste was, but he just smiled and demurred.\n\nInscrutable. \n\nThe secrets of Pin Wei were safe with him. After all, he was the owner, and he didn't want us trying to replicate his magic elixirs at home. He didn't want to be responsible for what might happen.\n\nHOT Damn, people! \n\nPRO TIP - How does Pin Wei compare with Han Dynasty in Old City?  Food wise, it is a very close call.  Both are excellent, and there is no point in picking one over the other based on the kitchen.  Where there is some separation is in the atmospherics.  Pin Wei is a small place compared to Chestnut Street.  The dining room is very crowded and thus quite loud.  It is a bit distracting. HanDynasty is in an old bank building, and although busy, possesses more nooks and crannies where it is possible to feel some level of  privacy, even in the crowd. The front of Pin Wei was packed with people waiting for tables, and we almost had to fight our way out after dinner. The bar area was SRO, while Han has a larger bar zone, which seldom feels overwhelmed with people.\n\nIt is obvious than the success of Pin Wei, is also its shortcoming.  It needs a much bigger space.  Whether it wants it or not is a separate question.",

    "text": "Cryo Spa Natural Healing Center in the Holland Shopping Center, Holland, PA, is a holistic alternative health services center at the intersection of Holland and Buck Roads. It can be a little challenging to reach if coming down Buck Road, but with patience the traffic and red lights can be overcome.  It is well worth your effort to find your way there. \n\nAlthough cryotherapy (exposing your body to extremely cold temperature for a short period of time to deal with autoimmune conditions through the release of endorphins and anti-inflammatory proteins) is the main attraction, I was there on a first visit for a full body massage to address lingering lower back issues. I was greeted promptly by the front desk person, who asked me to complete three pages of information regarding my medical history and reason for coming. Before I was finished, my masseuse Marla was introducing herself with warm smile and firm handshake.\n \nBefore starting the massage, I was also introduced to Lucy, the owner of the facility.  She offered to give me a quick tour.  She showed me the cryotherapy equipment, shiatsu and mediation rooms, and finally the massage chamber where Marla would attempt to loosen my lumbar/sacral spine and take my discomfort away.  The place is bigger than it looks from the outside, and Lucy was very knowledgeable about all the modalities offered. \n \nWhen it was time to start my massage, Marla directed me to disrobe and get under the sheets on the table, face down on the headrest. She left the room while I did so. Upon returning, she asked a few questions about the strength of the massage desired (strong), and instructed me to tell her if I was experiencing pain (Don't worry. I don't deal with pain in silence.) She explained that she would be doing a combination of stretches, deep tissue, pressure point and Swedish techniques which she labeled as, \"Sports Massage.\"  \n\nShe was amazing.  Her hands intuitively found the discomfort in my back and legs, and dug, kneaded, lifted/stretched my joints, and actually moved the muscles, tendons and ligaments around to release their tension and help them find their proper place in my body alignment. She had incredible strength, and was able to lift each leg, pull it further upward, while manipulating the musculature and joints. All the while, we conversed quietly about how I was feeling, giving me directions to help her, and informing me about her experience in massage and healthcare.  Fascinating woman.  Excellent healer. \n\nAfter my hour, I arose slowly.  I felt looser and longer.  More significantly, a sense of wellbeing and mild euphoria surrounded me. I was extremely relaxed and felt a limberness and flexibility that had been absent for a long while. I slept very well last night. \n\nThis morning, even as I write this review, my body feels like it is glowing. I know I will return to CryoSpa regularly to maintain and improve this sensation of health, strength and vitality. \n\nMarla did great work. I also want to give the Shiatsu a try, and if brave enough, go into the cryospa itself to see what that can do. \n\nTotally positive first impression.",

    "text": "This Jahan Kabob is the sister ship to a joint by the same name on Oxford Valley Road in Langhorne.  Yeah! That's right. The place tucked into the corner of a craft beer store just behind the Super Wawa.  But, the similarity ends with the name.  \n\nAbdul the owner and chef remembered me from the other place and gave me a smile.  His daughter sat by the register taking orders and making friendlies with the customers.  While waiting in line and perusing the take out menu, I took a look around this brand new Afghani/Middle Eastern establishment.  The bright neon beckoned all who find Morrisville an interesting, if offbeat, destination.  The floors were covered with oriental rug runners giving the space a feel of ethnicity, and in the rear stood a low platform with 6 meditation pillows for the Believers who felt the demand to pray before dining.\n\n Ah Salaam Ahlaikum, my brothers and sisters. \n\nWhen I entered I had intended to pick up and go, but the vibe (and aroma) was so unusual, that I decided to find a table to enjoy my meal right there.  When I reached the front of the line I had not decided what I wanted.  I asked Kadrianne what she recommended.  Abdul heard me, and turned from the grill to answer, \"Chicken Curry is what you want.\" \n\nObediently, I agreed. Sometimes, Kismet takes a hand. \n\nHe was totally right.  A few minutes later a plate full of thick yellow golden gravied Chicken chunks and a large pile of Long Grain \"Dirty\" Rice was placed before me. The flavors came through my nose first almost bringing me to tears. My tongue joined the festival a second later.  It is amazing how different curry tastes around the world, because this was neither Indian, nor Thai curry, but something in between.  Cooler and more subtle than it Indian brothers, and suggesting a tartness that its Thai cousins have mastered.  It was unique and savory; smooth and expressive.  The Rice was wonderfully mildly sweet in contradistinction to the Chicken. It seemed the obvious thing to do was mix them together.  That was a moment to remember as my oral senses rejoiced. \n\nThe green Afghani Tea was a good astringent between shoveling the delectables into my mouth.  The Sesame Cookie at the end of the meal, a kind token of appreciation.  \n\nThe other reviews are on target in 5 Starring Jahan Kabob.  This is a special place that will get even better with time, and become a landmark helping put Morrisville back on the cuisinery map where it belongs.",

    "text": "It's great to have a high end Napolitan pizza house in Newtown!  It's even better that the enterprise is owned by Pasquale and Anna, the proprietors of Osteria Vecchia, the excellent casa Italiana right down the street. This shop is for the daughter and son-in-law.  Thus, begin empires. \n\nThe building is on the site of the former Minuteman Press.  That old structure was taken down to the foundation, and a new Euro-Country Casual establishment arose.  Attention to detail is obvious, as the space is beautiful, with quality stone, wood, glass and a \"just off the boat\" wood burning hive oven covered in red glazed tile and contrasting white ceramic lettering that shouts, \"Pasquale & Anna/Acqua e Farina!\"  \n\nWe were greeted by Sal, the maestro de la casa, who sat my son and I at the corner table where we could see the whole operation.  We ordered a Siciliana pie, and as we waited, other servers brought thin slices of red sauced bread, and a small plate of Brussel sprouts that were soft and delicious from their time swimming in olive oil and spices.  I was even offered a glass of red wine on the house. Very cool touch!\n\nThe pie arrived with steam shimmering above it, on a large white platter.  It was cut in quarters, and covered in mozza, afterburn peccorino and chunks of eggplant.  Truly, a work of art with the bubbled crust and scorched undercarriage.  The special deal with these ovens is that they hold extremely high heat, such that the raw pie is placed in the oven for less than three minutes, while baking everything quickly and capturing all the flavor of the ingredients before they burn off and escape. The result is a wonderfully textured and tasty crust that is flavored by the ingredients you choose.  It is all about the dough (thus, the name, Water & Flour), and secondarily about the toppings.  Quite different than the better known pizza experience provided by most joints. \n\nSo it was here. A beauty to behold, and a pleasure to consume.  Of course, there is a downside to this approach to baking.  While the crust is excellent, the more ingredients you put on top, the wetter the center of the pie will be on the plate, because it is not possible to fully cook the veggies and meats in such a short time, and as a result of the lack of evaporation in the oven, the finished product will be softer that normal, and the drip from the collected moisture under the hood will be noticeable, and require care to avoid making a mess. \n\nThe secret is to order a simple pie with minimal topside accessories, so that the crust, cheese and sauce have the maximum opportunity to vent off the moisture.  This provides a drier bottom and optimal crustiness. \n\nDining at Acqua & Farina is very different than eating at pizza parlors.  It is designed as a feast for the senses.  There are more moving parts, and the resulting cost enhancement is noticeable. There is a time when \"two slices and a soda,\" is what you want, but there are also times when although you yearn for pizza, you want a more rousing experience.  \n\nAt those moments, Acqua e Farina will be calling your name.",

While it makes little difference for some of the other vendors' products in the too small building, sushi is an art form as well as a food product.  How it is prepared, presented and eaten makes a difference to the Zen experience that so enhances Sushi-Do. \n\nIt is like watching a master at work when the sharp knives flash, the sticky rice is molded into seaweed wraps, and out of the efficient motions of the chef emerges a work of art that you hate to disturb by eating.  It is quite a dilemma.  How much better it would be if you could sit along side a gurgling stream and listen to the songbirds as each morsel was praised before eating. (Sounds a bit like Oishi). \n\nBut, that isn't happening here, so the best you can do is take it home and devour it quickly to capture its fresh essence before it slips away, or just \"damn the torpedoes,\" and find a couple of empty chairs and enjoy it while everyone around you jostles for a place to sit, or scrape their tables and chairs to get in or out.  \n\nIf you have a Zen mind none of this will matter as you just shut it all out while you contemplate the exchange of energy from fish to you, and back again.",

Our membership entitled us to free entrance into the museum, and discount tickets to the special exhibits they always had coming in.  Too, we received some kind of courtesy from the gift shop.  \n\nIt was well worth the drive from Bucks County to explore the dinosaur permanent exhibit, as well as the few interactive corners and events that were available throughout the three story hall.  Digging for dinosaur fossils, and touching live reptiles and small mammals, had a profound effect on his young mind, and very likely explains why he now excels in high school science and math.  He went from wanting to be a paleontologist when he grew up, to a geologist, once he discovered there was something beyond huge skeletons in the ground.  \n\nThe diorama halls were persuasive in suggesting how various species lived in the wild, and had him imagining he was standing on the savannas of South Africa, watching wildebeests run in a panic from hunting lions. In truth, it wasn't just the kid having these thoughts. It brought that child out of his father, too. \n\nWe explored the butterfly exhibit before it became permanent, and the frog rooms while available. We watched the nature movies in the theater and encouraged each other to dream big when contemplating our planet and universe.  \n\nIn truth, we were also members of the Museum of Natural History in Manhattan, and went there as often as possible. It was much bigger and better in many ways, but lacked the convenience and crowd management that made the Academy so accessible.  No \"Night in the Museum,\" here, unless you were lucky enough to get a cub scout sleepover.  \n\nIf you scored that, anything was possible.",

It was a slat sign to be mounted on a larger directory sign in the front yard of this old converted 19th Century house.  I spoke with Scott Woron, who quickly looked at the old signs and explained to me that it was a thin vinyl sheet over the wood base that would carry the print, and not directly onto the planks.  He said it would be easy to do, and the cost would be very reasonable. \n\nI stopped back in today to pick up the signs.  They were ready and looked great! Cost less than the estimate I received from another sign company that specialized in only that one thing. Happy to save a few bucks and miles.  \n\nNow, I applied for the borough permit to put up the sign. Once that is secured and the office is inspected for the Use & Occupancy permit, I will have the signs put in place, and be open for business. \n\nIt was great to have it done correctly, on time, and at cost by the local Minuteman Press. \n\nLocal business scores again!",

It was in a different room, but still with Asian atmosphere and nice background music. \n\nOnce again, she asked a few questions about how I was feeling and where I was feeling it. She was most interested in how I had responded to the first massage two weeks before. In fact, my lower back, legs and shoulders responded well last time, and I was ready for another strong stretching and deep tissue therapeutic hour. \n\nThis time, except when I had to interact with her by resisting her pushing/pulling, I was more relaxed and was able to zone out and go somewhere within while she worked her magic. Marla dug deeper into my thighs which had absorbed the result of two herniated discs. Painful, but necessary to relieve stress and increase flexibility. Torquing my hips and legs to open space between my discs. Leaning her weight into my folded knees to help loosen the perpetual tightness in my lumbar spine. \n\nThe time passed quickly, but at its end I felt great, and almost intoxicated from the work done. The spa allowed me to sit in a quiet room for a few minutes until that sensation ended. \n\nSlept like a baby last night.\n\nPRO TIP - Marla actually works in several locations, just call her to find where is most convenient for you.",

Those beauties taking your order may look 18, but check their birth certificates, and you see they are really 78.\n\nPowerful elixir that Vanilla Swirl!\n\nWhile I wish they didn't use Styrofoam cups, there is no debate that the soft serve here is about as good as it gets.  The prices are ridiculous. The former \"Cash Only\" requirement not oppressive simply because credit cards weren't as prevalent 60 years ago. \n\nIf only the Dollar was still worth what is was Back in the Day.",

    "text": "I just had the best sandwich I have eaten in recent memory. \n\nHidden in plain sight at the rear of El Primo Mercado, the Mexican grocery store on Markley Street, Norristown, PA, is a moderate sized dining room and kitchen that cooks up amazing, authentic, wholesome, heavy plates of terrific comida Mexicana. Take a walk on the wild side past the bakery and chilis aisle, around the canned goods and wall of packaged tortillas, and finally humbly by the multitude of Madre Maria statuary looking down from the high shelves, into the eating area. Pull out a chair at a small table and await the friendly bilingual servers to present the large menu and take your drink order from the homemade fruit drinks and rice horchata. \n\nI picked the Torta Milanesa de Pollo (fried breaded chicken sandwich) thinking it was a good way to introduce myself to the chef's skills. What I got was a gigantic sandwich on fresh super roll, loaded with delicious thin chicken breast, spicy mayo, lettuce, soft queso fresca (string cheese) and avocado. I could only eat half, and brought the rest home, where my 19 year old son devoured it in seconds, uttering only a muffled \"Wow, this IS good,\" as he came up for air.\n\nIt was the second best thing I had consumed this year, after the Greek dessert I ate last week in Princeton. Just amazing, and worth the hour long drive back to Norristown from Bucks County just to see what else this cocina can turn out as remarkable as that Torta.",

    "text": "The Grange Fair is a traditional country fair run annually at this site in Wrightstown, Pa. It has all the attributes you would expect from a cultural events that has run for more than a century.  Livestock displays and competitions, 4H halls full of pies, pickled foods, flower arrangements, and art, with colored ribbons for the winners. \n\nIn addition, you can buy a tractor, arrange for a home visit by a landscaper or stone mason, and indulge yourself in carney food to your heart's content. For the kids (in each of us), there is a ride area with enough spinning, dipping and diving to upset your stomach for a week. My advice, ride before you eat, or better yet, come twice, once to ride and another visit to eat. The food is what you expect from a greasy country joint. Burgers, Sausage, Franks, Pizza, Ice Cream, and Kettle Korn (my fave). There is usually a beer wagon around that pours out a local brew and leaves a wet trail of suds on the ground. Beware the drunken bees that congregate there. Man, would I love to have some of the Beer Honey that hive puts out! \n\nYes, there are a fair share of Carney barkers and hucksters to enjoy with vigilance, and the local politicians trying hard to find votes by giving out balloons to kids. But, you can ignore that degradation and enjoy everything else. \n\nThe place is crowded at night when the cooler air invites families to come out for a night of old fashioned entertainment.  There is something special about a country fair at night. But, if you prefer to avoid the bigger crowds, arriving in the afternoon allows you a clearer view, and the ability to park and walk through the tents and sheds at an easy pace, when everyone who works there has more time to pay attention to you.\n\nBe sure to make time to come up here. The roads around it are jammed in the evening, so give yourself time to wait in line.  If you know the roads, it is easier to approach from the north or west. Take out your GPS or paper maps and figure out how to do that. You could save yourself an hour of more in the queue.  \n\nThe Grange Fair is definitely a child memory maker, so be sure to start your kids early and allow them to carry on this wonderful All American tradition.",

    "text": "Cafe Madison Holland sits in the Pheasant Valley Center at the bottom of Buck Road where a Chinese restaurant used to be. They have done a great renovation to the space and turned it into an attractive, comfortable room full of photos of customers. There are about a half dozen tables and small 6/7 stool counter for lone travellers. I grabbed a spinner so as not to take up a table and be able to chat with the staff. Turned out that Dean the owner was in the house, and we ended up in a long conversation about the trials and tribulations of opening a food business in Northampton. Let's just say his experience was not a business friendly welcome. \n\nGlad he saw it through, because he has created an excellent place for an Americana breakfast. It is warm and feels quickly like home. The menu is extensive for the morning and afternoon meals and prices are fair. I opted to sample their french toast and homemade sausage patty with coffee. At $8.75, it was a deal and a half! \n\nThe toast was expertly turned. Amply saturated with egg/sugar/vanilla mix, the bread was thin and the right texture to absorb to its core. The edges were nicely caramelized to a mild crisp. The sausage was a freeform patty with very good flavor. I was glad I asked my server to help me choose among the alternatives. She was dead on that I should go with it. I appreciated that while they didn't have maple syrup, they at least had Log Cabin, rather than those corn syrup sweeteners. Lastly, the coffee was a Bunn drip that was hot and strong. \n\nI have a feeling that Madison Cafe Holland is going to be a big hit where there are few good choices for a decent breakfast and lunch. It isn't that far from Newtown nor Feasterville that it won't draw from those communities as well. It will help put this corner of Northampton Township back on the map, something that has been missing since the passing of the Mill Race Inn. With Two Ladies Bakery Cafe, Johnny Apples, and Salvo's Pizza and a few other restaurants nearby, it is beginning to be a worthy destination again. \n\nI, for one, am very excited to see this happening.",

When done well, they are both attractive and useful in ways unforeseen when the structure was first constructed, and bring new uses into old packages, calling the imagination of the new occupant forward in wonderment. The Johnson Hall Coffee House is a great example. It offers a shop unimagined in 1890 when it was build, yet as redesigned, it provides a functioning java house that could have existed at that time, but has emerged due to the evolving cultural affections of our modern day. It looks old, but isn't. \n\nIt is a  warm, light and airy high ceilinged first floor retail outlet for excellent coffee products and breakfast, brunch and lunch options. Although limited by the kitchen equipment available to prepare meals, it still provides enough variety to make a stop very worthwhile. I loved the large windows, dropped period lighting, white ceramic tile, wood plank floors, and the friendliness of the staff. \n\nI ordered an egg and cheese breakfast sandwich on croissant, with mug o' joe. It came in at about $8, and while ordering was at the counter in back, the servers brought the sandwich to my table. They would be wise to advertise the coffee roaster more dominantly both in the store and online, as I am sure I was not the only one curious about who produced the quality beans. The croissant was not quite French boulangerie, but still large and tasty enough to be satisfying. \n\nStill, the atmosphere here is the star of the show. It is a great place for both solitary and collective pleasures.",

    "text": "All good things come to an end, so when my 13 year old war horse Infiniti finally went to the junkyard in metal heaven, I was sad, but not really surprised. Over 200,000 miles is a long life. It didn't owe me anything, and I had beaten the crap out of it.\n\nI began a search for a replacement by checking with Car Gurus, an internet site that had been successful for me in the past. I thought I wanted to stick with the Infiniti brand, but find something newer in a quality used car. Compared to Lexus there were amazingly few oldies but goodies around. That was precisely why I chose Infiniti to begin with. Just didn't want the most popular in school, but that hidden understated gem. \n\nOn the second search I found a newer M 35x with low mileage on the lot at Holman Infiniti over in Maple Shade, New Jersey, about 25 miles away. \n\nI gave them a call to find out if it was still there, and spoke with Mario Pinardo in their sales department. He went out to check and came back enthusiastic about how good the vehicle looked - Pearl White with light leather interior. I expected him to try to sell it, but he seemed naturally excited by what he saw. I asked him to hold it for me until tomorrow. He said he could only do so until 11:00 AM Tuesday. \n\nI was there at 10:00. \n\nThis M 35x was worth being excited about. Perfect body. Not a scratch, dent nor ding. Immaculate within, with beautiful wood trim, sleek and sexy front and back. Well detailed to a perfect glowing leather, wood and metal trim. The drive was strong, responsive, with throaty exhaust and acceleration that offered no apologies for being six cylinders, 3.5 liters, as opposed to the eight 4.5 L the old boy threw around. Better gas mileage, too. And, the price for all that was very reasonable, and made it nearly impossible to walk away from. \n\nYup! An hour later it was mine and I drove it home. \nThe experience at Holman was excellent from beginning to end. The dealership is large, but they kept everything at a comfortable human scale. Mario was great. He was genuine, engaged and led us through the process with precise guidance. Even the minutes with the finance manager were decent. I didn't mind that he was a Cowboys fan.",

    "text": "Comes a time when those small trees taking root in the gutters of my home had to be dealt with, my sons didn't want to do it and climbing 30 feet up and down a ladder was a fool's errand for me. Had to bite the bullet and look for someone with the equipment and ability to do the job and stop it from being an annual problem. \n\nAfter doing research and connecting with both local handymen, contractors and those professional gutter protection companies, I came to the conclusion that the only way to have the work done right, with warranty and acceptable prices was to go with the guys who specialize in this business. I chose LeafFilter Gutter Protection, a franchise located in Sharon Hill, PA. \n\nI contacted them through their website and had a call back the next day. We met at my home a few days later, when I met Dan, their sales representative. He had a routine to go through, but he was genuine and made honest eye contact. He measured the gutters and explained their process and materials to me. I liked him, and found their technology to make sense compared to the competition. They have their pricing technique like the other solicitors for this service, which is always a put off, but ultimately we worked something out that was good for me on price, including 12 month interest-free financing. \n\nTheir crew arrived a day later with all they needed to complete the job. They power cleaned the existing gutters, anchored them firmly into the fascia with long screws and new braces, and them installed their vinyl covers and micro screens into the covers' frames. They finished about 5 hours later, cleaned up their mess completely and spoke with me about what they had seen up there that might need attention in the future. I signed off on the work order and sent them on their way. \n\nWe are expecting heavy weather this week, so the new LeafFilter will get an early workout. Given how much trouble the gutters were in past storms, I am looking forward to seeing how well the system works, and beyond that putting aside the worry I have felt wondering whether the next heavy rain would completely overwhelm the old aluminum runnels and knock them to the ground. \n\nIf this works as expected, I will put this anxiety behind, and become a convert to LeafFilter. If it doesn't hold up as advertised and warranted, there will be an addendum to this review. \n\nFor now, 5 STARS and a lot of anticipation.",

We clearly came from different perspectives and had desperate sources of information, but reached some consensus due to our calm, respecting demeanor and good grub. It was the best exchange I have had with strangers in a long time. \n\nFor that alone a fifth star is awarded in appreciation.",

Thankfully, Grapevine is a pleasure to frequent, as  Chuck and his people are knowledgeable and super friendly. It just feels good when I walk into his shop and he calls out my name in greeting.  I don't get that kind of reception in big boxes.  \n\nOne of the coolest things about Grapevine is that in Spring and Summer the storefront is one giant hanging flower garden shop.

    "text": "For a coffee lover there is nothing as satisfying as quality raw coffee beans, freshly roasted, ground and brewed by a favorite method to create the perfect cuppa joe. Once introduced to apex java brew there is just no going back to Maxwell House or Folgers. \n\nThere are a number of excellent local roasters that provide the materials to produce this great way to greet the day. Covered Bridge in Feasterville is now one of my favorites. Housed in a rear out building behind an industrial garage, they have established a small shop loaded with all the paraphernalia needed to reproduce your coffee at home, with heavy duty roaster in back that produces enough customized volume to keep their growing list of consumers satisfied within a few days of ordering. In our case, we ordered directly from their website on Friday night and received an email that our beans were ready for pickup Saturday morning. The \"born on\" date stamped on the back of the resealable brown bag was actually the previous Monday.  \n\nThat's pretty darn fresh. \n\nOrdered were Ethiopian Natural Kembata Grade 1 and The Bee's Knees Breakfast Blend (Ethiopia & Brasil). Over years of java drinking I learned that the valleys and mountainsides of Ethiopia grew the best coffee beans on the planet. Mild, yet richly textured taste, I am willing to hunt for and pay more for it, rather than settle for mass produced coffee from Columbia and the like. So, I opened that bag this morning and inhaled deeply. \n\nIts powerful aroma was overwhelming. \n\nI waited a moment to let that snort settle in. It was decadent, yet innocent. I decided on a pour over of an individual mug, rather than brewing a full pot. When the filtered water was boiling in the whistle teapot, I began to slowly pour it through the cone filter and grounds sitting in our glass mug top funnel.  \n\nThe result was near euphoria. First sip of the jet black suspension was intense, steamy, perfectly delicious coffee, that disclosed its lithe muscular body and subtle undertones of cocoa, strawberry and orange as it played on my tongue. It was as interesting as a fine glass of wine, without the alcohol, but with a similar intoxicating affect. \n\nAt $15/lb., it isn't cheap, but given how deprived we have all been in this lockdown quarantine Year of Covid, a little decadence at home is likely a good thing.",

The ambiance is def Taiwanese old school, with Grace and son working the Hario syphon butane java makers with aplomb and verve.  The best locally roasted beans are used to make single cups of joe, that are delivered to the table on a small tray, with doily and excellent butter cookie aboard. Little spout of milk on the side. \n\nThe Ethiopian Yirgacheffe beans from Main Line Coffee Roasters, were freshly ground the moment before their boiling bath and syphoning through the beautiful glass system, producing a superb cuppa joe. Not to put too fine a point on it, but this was among the very best coffee I have ever enjoyed. To watch Grace make my cup from grinding through pouring, was to see an artist at work. Perfect temperature. Perfectly balanced acidity.  A pleasure to imbibe. Easy to become addicted.  The Hario equipment was lined up on her counter, and the butane burner emitted a cool blue flame that brought the filtered water to a boil and flushed it up the tube and down through the coffee against a cloth filter.  Pure alchemy! \n\nEven the butter cookie with the colorful sprinkles was a winner. Hard and crisp, the way it should be. \n\nYes. At $5 a cup, this is not for the faint hearted. But, for coffee lovers and mavens, going to Ray's is a trip to the mountaintop to sit at the feet of the javamaster.",

The peanut butter was high quality (way better than Skippy), creamy smooth that melded wonderfully with the equally soft and sexy chocolate casing.

    "text": "First a bit of housekeeping - Winckler's Ribs is hard to find.  It is located in a small space on Washington Street, immediately to the rear of Anthony's Pizza. It is north of Bridge Street and difficult to see until you are right on top of it. Look for the red awning. Your perseverance will be rewarded.\n\nWalking in, I immediately met Mike Winckler, owner and rib chef extraordinaire.  He was sitting on the only seating available inside his shop; a small bench for take out customers (and resting top chefs) to chill while waiting for the next wave.  He looked up at me with a smile as I apologized for ending his moment of peace. He was wearing a white chef's pants, jacket and high hat.\n\nAs I was the only buyer I took the opportunity to talk with him and look around as he stood over the grill working my order of a half rack of ribs. The sizzle and smoke arose in energetic clouds as it was sucked up by the exhaust fans.  Some of it escaped to my nose where my brain immediately went into hyperdrive as the sauce molecules slammed into my sensory filters.  \n\nOh My!  Involuntary salivation. Gulp.\n\nI saw his shelf of hot sauces from around the world, and those cans of mysterious powders in shades of orange, red and yellow like you find in huge piles in old markets in India or Pakistan. Not curries, but something more esoteric. The ribs were now showing black streaks where the meat was completely cauterized and the sugars from the marinade and basting sauces were caramelizing into a crunchy sealant. As the final step, Mike poured the red amber finishing sauce over the ribs, turning them a glossy orange-red. Loved that tint. \n\nHe packed the finished ribs in an aluminum foil bottomed styro box, accompanied by a small cup of his Cole Slaw and a chunk of Corn Bread.  Afterwards, we watched the video commercial for his ribs through You Tube on his HDTV above a refrigerator.  It was fun and further built my anticipation.  I drove home excited. \n\nThis prelude would be meaningless unless his ribs backed up all this build up.  \n\nThey did.\n\nThe meat willingly parted from the bone. The first bite was a surprise.  Rather than the sweet, tart BBQ explosion I expected, I was confronted with something more subtle.  The taste was complex; both mildly sweet and hot, with undertones of other spices I could not identify.  Nutmeg?  Something sort of nutty?  Not sure, but I loved it.  The texture of the meat remained intact. Softly chewy and sticky.  The glaze and shards of meat that were left on the bone were sucked off with relish.  \n\nThe Cole Slaw was sweet.  The Corn Bread was really more like Corn Cake - moist and sweet.  \n\nI loved these ribs, although they were different than what I had eaten before.  It was obvious that a lot of thought, study and preparation went into their creation.  \n\nI will return, and may have found a buried treasure in the droning leftoverness of Morrisville, in the shadows of Trenton, alongside the mighty Delaware flow.",

    "text": "It had been more than a year since my last visit to Marty's Place. Time flies! \n\nI was driving by this morning after court, having skipped breakfast at home in order to get a jump on traffic going into the city.  I saw a new sign out front on a Bud Light white board that breakfast was now being served 7 days a week!  \n\nHot diggity!\n\nI parked out back and walked in to a mostly empty bar (2 customers who looked like they were regulars).  The bartender approached and we engaged about their breakfast menu.  It was pretty wide open if my desires had anything to do with eggs.  They did. I opted for a sausage, egg and cheese on Kaiser roll, and mug of java.  While it was being created in the kitchen I watched a show about exotic car auctions.  A Borgati opening at a cool million bucks was an eye opener.  Another black transport used by John Lennon around London was also put up and sold.  Pretty cool entertainment. \n\nThe sandwich was great!  Double patty, fried egg, American cheese and a fresh, quality roll, made for a tasty and fun meal.  The side of homefries was likewise excellent - hot, crisp and spicy with saut\u00e9ed onions in the mix. Coffee, strong and kicking. The only shortcomings were the lack of a joe refill offering, and lack of utensils. Luckily, I had a spoon from the coffee, which was fine as a shovel.  \n\nAfterall, Marty's is still a wonderful corner dive.  It was made for comfort, not for speed, nor etiquette.",

    "text": "My fourth visit overall to Caf\u00e9 Chorba, and the first in over 6 months.  It was nice to return to the friendly, comfy confines of this fine house. \n\nThis morning, I was the only patron at the counter and Marie was my attentive server. She was solicitous and informative, keeping my coffee mug full, and providing a glass of milk for the coffee rather than the ubiquitous tiny creamers.  I finally had the strength to move beyond the excellent French Toast and try something new.  \n\nToday I moved on to the Greek Omelet.  It was spectacular with a pile of crunchy edged Home Fries, and Rye Toast.  The 3 egg platter was loaded with peppers, onions, tomatoes, Italian sausage, and feta cheese. They blended together well on the tongue, and with a little black pepper on top was terrific.  The taters could not be finished as they occupied nearly half the large plate.  Still, they were the right combo of crunch and tender properly spiced with a hint of butter to sweeten the palate. \n\nIt was a huge and hugely successful breakfast complete with good service and lots of fresh coffee.  \n\nIt is not hyperbole to say that Caf\u00e9 Chorba is as good as it gets for breakfast in the area and beyond. \n\nTime for an upgrade to 5 Stars.",

The service is timely, friendly, and efficient.  The lunch menu was still in play although I walked in at 3:02. Only one other table occupied, and a couple at the bar.  Snow starting to fall. It felt like a Dashell Hamett novel. \nFirst visit and I went for the Pad Thai.  It was excellent!  Hot, attractively presented with cool sprouts, and lime to bring out the tamarind and peanut undertones. Impressive portion for a lunch.  Jasmin tea chaser. \nWonderful lunch.\nIs it as \"good as it gets?\"  I won't know until I go back for more...soon.\n\n10.27.13 - Returned for the fourth time last night and was again totally impressed with the atmosphere, service and cuisine.  I have ordered off the menu and from the specials, and each dish has been unusually flavorful, interesting and satisfying.  Last night I had Singapore Laksa Curry Noodle, a thick rich Coconut Curry Soup, loaded with a variety of shellfish, chicken, tofu, whole egg and veggies.  The coconut curry was subtle, yet spicy enough to warrant some caution.  I could not finish.  At $12. I was pleased.  Along with Jasmine Tea, I was a sated and happy man.  \n\nI think 5 Stars is warranted for Aroi Thai & Asian Bistro.  Aside from some amazing places I have visited in Bangkok and Pattaya, this is as good as I have had in the USA.",

    "text": "A new generation of \"comfy casual\" dining is sprouting around the nation, and its seeds have germinated in Mt. Holly.  Kitchen 87 has taken root and its flowers are blooming even in the depth of winter.  While most diners, luncheonettes and caf\u00e9s are second or third generation owned and operated, or simply maintaining the status quo under new management, this creekside establishment is going in a new direction.  Young owners with fresh ideas and fine execution bring streetlife and adventurous palates to once bucolic Mt. Holly.  \n\nDon't get me wrong, I love the traditional places making good food and reminding me of home.  Yet, there is plenty of room for a joint using the same ingredients, but reconstructing the menu into something unique and totally enjoyable, while keeping the sense of hearth and home through their use of most of the same tools and kitchenware with which we are all familiar.\n\nFrom the vantage point of a counter stool, a spin around shows a wall lined with booths, a bunch of tables mid-floor, and a swinging kitchen door through which very friendly and gregarious servers come and go.  They are obviously proud of what they are doing, and want to share their confidence and happiness at being part of this enterprise.  I had good conversations with two women who were interested in more than just light pleasantries.  They really wanted to know what I thought about their place, and a slice of my worldview.  I was pleased to share.  \n\nMy breakfast was on par with everything else that was happening inside Kitchen 87.  I had the \"Which Came First\" Sandwich - Breaded Chicken Patty, Swiss, Fried Egg, on a Brioche Roll, with Home Fries on the side.  It was a hot, happy, delicious, mess.   Knife and fork were mandatory, as it was too big and slick to be handled.  Everything melded well together, with drippy egg running through everything and giving its blessing to the rest.  The taters were dark grilled and spiced just right.  I really enjoyed every bite, although I could not finish the side.  The Coffee was brewed strong and the pot returned to me several times. \n\nIn the mood for a great breakfast that challenges you preconceptions about what can be done with eggs, cheese, bread, meat and potatoes?  \n\nYou are ready for Kitchen 87.",

It sits in a small commercial strip on West Moreland Avenue, Hatboro; the last storefront, farthest from Blair Mill Road. \n\nOnce inside, you find about ten tables with the counter and kitchen in the back of the house. I was greeted warmly by one of the owners, who guided me to a corner table and handed me their menu. Most of the offerings were Mexican, with a few Salvadoran specialties. I selected the chili rellenos (stuffed chili) dinner, which included rice, beans and a basket of four hot tortillas. \n\nIt took a while for my meal to arrive, but when it did, I immediately saw how big the poblano pepper was, and was advised by la senora that the dish was made from scratch for me. I could taste the difference. The queso stuffing was plentiful; the egg wrap completely encased the pepper, and the red salsa on top was fresh and piquant. A totally delicious take on this standard. This was one of my favorite Mexican dishes taken to a new level of satisfaction. Yes. It was worth the wait. \n\nI also appreciated the old school approach to the chips and salsa gracing my table gratis. In the new world where many restaurants now charge for this table snack, it was very nice to have them placed in front of me with just a smile. In that regard, the chips were served warm and crunchy. The salsa was placed on the table in plastic rockets for squirting into small black bowls. They were smooth versions of hot sauce, and at first I missed the chunks of tomato, pepper and onion. The taste was the same, it just lacked the thickness I normally associate with salsa. I'll give them a pass on that. \n\nThis King of Diamonds is a full house of Mexican/Salvadoran cuisine. Definitely, worth a stop on your visits south of the border.",

Those of us who remember when this was the old Burlington Diner find it all the more remarkable, because it took so long for the BD to finally die that most of us forgot there could be good food at that location.  \n\nAnd, good it is.  The signature omelets are 3 eggers full of whatever you want.  Wet or dry, potatoes in or out, the result is a belly busting, can't stop myself, corker of a meal. The service is right in line with the product; fresh and swaggering. I haven't made it past the omelets, French Toast, breakfast sandwiches and a Quesadilla, but all have been at the very least, very good.  \n\nPRO TIP - Try to sit in the old original boxcar dining room.  It is so well maintained it feels like you are chowing down in a museum.  It makes everything taste even better.",

The sandwich emporium is as small as your master bedroom closet, but managed to turn out excellent breakfasts and lunches within its miniscule confines.  \n\nIt is a Boar's Head joint, but with the license to roast the turkey, ham and roast beef on its own when delivered there by this provider.  That extra touch of freshness and originality shows that it is trusted to do excellent work to maintain the brand, and that they succeed in doing so.  Impressive.\n\nToday, I ordered a blackboard special - a cup of Potato Leek Soup, and a third of a Roast Turkey & Swiss Hoagie.  The price; $5.95.  While waiting, I spoke to \"Debbie,\" who is really her former partner after she left the business many years ago.  He is proud of his shop, and it shows in the clean, cozy atmosphere, and the outstanding quality of his products.  \n\nThe Potato Leek Soup was heavily chunked with spuds and leek in a rich, creamy base.  Delicious.  Obviously, made with love that very day.  The sandwich came on fresh, light Italian loaf.  The home baked gobbler was cool, tasty and a pleasure to consume, with a couple slices of Swiss nuttiness to complement the more savory turkey.  A delight.  \n\nIf Debbie's gets too famous, it will have to move to larger quarters, as there is room for at most ten standing people in there.  Nice problem to have.  It is somewhat surprising that these guys haven't run into this situation before.  \n\nStreet parking can be a challenge on the narrow one-way streets in that neighborhood. But, worth the effort.",

Only one table was occupied by women in bonnets, although a few people came in to pick up take out orders. Sherry was running the floor, and cheerily brought me the clipboard menu along with a cool copper mule mug of water and lemon. Prices were on the high side, but given the description of the food and Sherry's enthusiasm for each of them, I accepted that this was a \"budget be damned\" moment. I ordered the chicken milanese sandwich with side salad. The order in, I then saw Ms. Cattani herself putting my meal together. She waved and said hello while cheffing for me. \n\nTurns out she is basically a self taught uber foodie, who decided to open her open shop after working for other restaurants for several years. She is self taught and obviously a great student of her craft. \n\nMy lunch arrived on a thin wood plank. Minimalist, but strikingly presented. A feast for the eyes, and ultimately, the stomach. The chicken breast was pounded into a thin steak, lightly breaded in Italian crumbs and pan fried, with marinated peperonata, parmesan and aged balsamic drip on a crusty seeded \"rustic\" torpedo roll. It was delicious. No one off, this. Each element made a contribution to the overall work of art. I like milanese dishes, and even prepare them at home. Still, none are as interesting and tasty as this, and it was just a sandwich! What would it have been as a stand alone fully plated dinner? Don't know, but a week later I am still thinking of when to find out. \n\nAll the while, Sherry was seeing to the incoming phone orders and refilling my water mug during the gaps in the calls. Service was friendly and informative. I was well cared for. \n\nThis was a superior lunch from an unexpected source.\n\n Surprise was perhaps the tastiest part of the dish.",

    "text": "Part of the Pennsylvania Community College System, Bucks County Community College has three campuses. The largest is the 200 acre preserve in Newtown, sitting at the edge of Tyler State Park. The Tyler Mansion anchors the northern edge of the campus, and provides some administrative office space to the school, as well as a facility for the many catered events that take place there. The park and the manse offer the institution an expanse and historic dignity seldom found in our new public schools of higher education. \n\nThe tuition is approximately $10,000 per year, but most students qualify for some financial aid, bringing the average expense closer to $7,200. So, it is a good deal compared to double that cost for other state schools in the Commonwealth. Many of my son's friends start at BCCC and transfer to a four year college after graduation, thus saving money in the interim so they can more easily afford reaching a complete university education. \n\nRecently, I drove over to the school to receive my two Covid vaccinations (Pfizer). Bucks Department of Health had transformed the student center into a large injection site. With online registration and email reminders, it was a convenient and efficient place to take care of this important community health care responsibility. The staff was professional and humane, with easy directions to proceed through the process. No long lines. Little fuss. No muss. \n\nI was impressed with how smoothly everything went, and how well the school cooperated with the county government and the thousands people who chose to visit the school to take care of their important business.",

    "text": "This old pre-Revolutionary War building has been well restored into an excellent interactive museum of the colonial period of New Jersey history. Given how poorly the other landmarks have fared in this capital city, the condition of this one is all the more remarkable and very worthy of a visit or two by history buffs. \nIt was built in 1758 to house British soldiers during the French & Indian War. Colonists objected to being required to quarter Redcoats in their homes, as even at that time tension was high between people who identified as Jerseyites more than English subjects and resented the control the King had over their lives. The colonial government built five of these barracks around the colony, although this one in Trenton is the only survivor. \nThere were Hessians and a few British officers housed here in December, 1776, when General Washington crossed the Delaware River on Christmas Day eve and surprised the enemy with an early morning cannon barrage and brief fighting, leading to a rapid collapse of any defense and the surrender of Colonel Rall and his 1,200 men. There was more fighting to be done the following week at the Second Battle of Trenton (Assunpink Creek Bridge) on January 2, 1777, and the Battle of Princeton on the 3rd, but this quick victory set the tone for the success to come, and convinced the Continental Army, Continental Congress and the American colonists that this insurrection could be won and that George Washington was the man to do it.\nThe barracks became an army hospital thereafter, and it was here that army physicians conducted the first inoculations of small pox to protect the troops from the deadly pox. This was the first attempt at inoculations anywhere in the modern world. In more recent times, the buildings were reduced to what remains today to make way for Front Street to reach the New Jersey Statehouse. What we see now was privately owned for a time and used for housing, until purchased by a few revolutionary war memorial groups who wanted to preserve and protect it for posterity. \nThese days it is a surprisingly excellent museum of the revolutionary period, restored authentically to look like active soldiers living quarters, with workers/guides dressed in appropriate period costume.

    "text": "If you remember your childhood ice cream experiences with wistful images of hanging out at the old shack where the sweetest, creamiest, drippiest, crispest cone crunch, brought the timeless taste of the best childhood memories dancing back to your tongue, then Jo-Jo's is your magic carpet ride. Homemade 'scream so potent and cooly fresh, that a single lick transports you to that first moment you tasted these awesome American flavors of life. \n\nThis 1950's summer pleasuredome is a full monty.  The whitewashed walls, the elbow lighting, the sliding windows for orders and pick up.  The young faces of high school kids with their first summer jobs.  The old, wizened eyes of the master ice cream maker; watching intently as the next generation of innocence both inside the shop and outside on the winding line, take their turn on the carousel.  The pristine ecstasy of your child's first taste; a drippy spot on her nose.  \n\nAll this happens effortlessly at Jo-Jo's.  So glad I found it. \n\nMy Peanut Butter Vanilla and Salted Caramel Pretzel scoops were as good as I have eaten anywhere.  Richness in flavor, texture and human interaction. My tastebuds rejoiced.  I sat with my cup of joy and watched as everyone else \"kvelled\" with this luscious pleasure.  \n\nHow great to be there on a warm mid-March evening, before the crowds of summer demand delayed gratification, and I can be the first on line.  \n\nSimple.  Sweet Life.",

    "text": "Down at the bottom of Walton Road, Warwick Township, Bucks County, PA, lies perhaps the most enchanted spot in all of Pennsylvania. Ross Mill Farm has been a secret haven since originally started before the Revolutionary War in 1740. \n\nThe lane is narrow and full of dips and rough riding, but so very worth the effort to find, especially if you love adaptive reuse of an historic property turned into a rescue home and boarding facility exclusively for Vietnamese Pot Belly Pigs. \n\n180+ residents live there now, either from broken homes or as paying customers, housed there because it is simply the best place on the planet for happy, healthy PBPs. The 30 acres are idyllic for humans, too, but the facilities are designed by the owner from the perspective of an intelligent animal that stands little more that 18 inches from the ground. To truly interact with the residents you really have to get down on your knees, because these cuties lack the ability to look up at you. So, the world is very short, but expansive at Ross Mill Farm. The green lawns and gardens are perfectly suited for a pig. \n\nAnd, for people who love them. \n\nThis amazing patch of heaven on the Little Neshaminy Creek is as magic as you want it to be. I found it easy to get lost in the peaceful magic of the moment. Make a donation and help it last forever.",

The people are friendly and confident in the quality of their menu.\n\nI stopped in last week for breakfast and totally enjoyed the experience. Their french toast made with fresh challah was excellent. The egg/vanilla/sugar/cinnamon mix soaked in well and the hot grill caramelized the edges just right. Most important, the house used pure maple syrup and cold butter to allow me to doctor the slices the way I like best. I sipped my strong coffee (with fresh whole milk) as the beurre melted and the syrup eddied and swirled on the plate. \n\nIt was delicious. I kept cutting the toast into smaller pieces to maximize absorbency and stretch out the pleasure. \n\nIt was a quiet morning with only one other table occupied. The music track was alternative rock that suited the atmosphere of the house. \n\nLiv & Charlie know what they are doing. \n\n5 Stars all the way!",

    "text": "If you enjoy narrow gauge vertical lift truss bridges from the early part of the 20th Century, the Burlington-Bristol Bridge is for you.  I cross it several times a month on my way to Mt. Holly, NJ from Bucks County, Pa, but I keep both hands on the wheel to be able to drive in the single lane across the Delaware River, and can't \"check in\" often on Yelp.  Take my word for this.  \n\nWhile true that the drive is challenging, it is also somewhat exhilarating.  From the apex the view up and down the Mighty Delaware is large. The waterfronts of historic Bristol and Burlington are in full sight.  Burlington Island to the north sits midstream with the ruins of a 19th Century amusement park slumbering in the shade, its once proud roller coaster a skeleton after a fire destroyed the park.  To the south the rust of other Industrial Age factories likewise lie in ruin, or continue to operate and belch waste out of decayed smokestacks.  \n\nThe engineering involved in the design of the lift mechanisms was invented by the Romans, but is still the height of expertise two thousand years later.  Watching the megaton slabs of concrete lower from the twin towers, and cause the lift of the central roadway with pulleys and cable, is also an amazement.  If I wasn't in such a rush to get to court I might really marvel at this human feat.  As it is, it is a very cool way to be delayed by forces beyond my control.  \n\nIf time is not an insurmountable issue, there are great places in both towns that gave their names to this span, where meal and drink can be secured in its very shadow.",

    "text": "Arriving at 3:30, I learned Ban Bamboo closed for two hours on Saturday afternoon and reopened at 4. So, I had a little time to wander along Ridge Avenue and take in the beautiful Spring day and the local color. The street scene was active with outdoor seating at the brewery and many open doors allowing the kitchen aromas to waft out to we pedestrians. Definitely created the aura of being a neighborhood. \n\nWhen BB's \"Open\" sign lit, I went in to discover a small dining area with lovely Buddha shrine front and center, and heavy southeast Asian decor all around. A cafe in Vientiane or Pattaya would look as good. I ordered Tom Kha Soup (veggie), Beef Satay, Red Curry (veggie), Drunken Noodles (chicken), and Kai Soi (beef), to go. It was 40 minutes to readiness, so I continued my exploration of the area while waiting, and thought about what I remembered about Lao and Thai cuisine. \n\nWhile both are very regionalized so that there are many distinctions even in different parts of each country. Still, there are a few generalities that hold true. Where Thai uses coconut milk in many dishes making it sweet, often counterbalanced by the heat of chili peppers and bitterness of lemongrass; Lao kitchens lack coconuts, and use more lime and fermented fish sauces for flavor. Lao is a lot saltier than Thai. \n\nSo, it was easy to know which was which in my package. The Tom Kha Soup came on strong on sweetness from its coconut milk/galangal base, followed immediately by a lemongrass bite. It could have used more variety of veggies in the bowl, but the taste profile set off a riot in my mouth. The Red Curry was similar in sweetness, but lit a fire from the chili paste used to turn the color crimson. The veggies were still semi firm, adding to the texture, along with the bell pepper, bamboo shoots and Thai basil. The Beef Satay was lean meat with excellent BBQ type sauce, and on the sweeter side. Drunken Noodles were definitely from Thailand in flavor and plenty spicy from roasted chili sauce. Kai Soi, on the other hand, was more a hybrid, using thin sliced beef in a coconut milk broth, mixed with egg noodles, red onion, cabbage and lemon/lime juices. It reminded of Indian curry with its sweet/sour profile. \n\nAlthough travel time neutralized the higher taste amplitudes to reduce the delicate intricacies that exited the kitchen, it was still a wonderfully entertaining meal that is well worth revisiting, along with this Ridge Avenue neighborhood.",

    "text": "Ratchada is a district in Bangkok known for less bustle while very entertaining. This Thai/Laotian house takes its name and atmosphere from this more mellow part of a very intense big city.  It is apt, as when walking in off of S. 11th Street (a half block off Washington), you immediately feel a sense of decompression and culture shift from urban hubbub to Asian serenity.  The dark wood tones, silks, and wall art invite you to leave the outside world behind, and wade into a secret jasmine scented pool of tranquility. \n\nHyperbole? Perhaps. But, after the week I just finished, it felt so to me. \n\nWe were seated immediately and on time by Jib, the diminutive whirlwind who seemed to be everywhere at once.  She was graceful, smiling, communicative and clearly loved what she was doing.  The menu was quickly explained and we were given ample time to peruse and select.  Tom Yum Nam Khon (Creamy Lemongrass Soup) and Tom Kha (Coconut Soup) to begin.  Fried Calamari to appetize.  Ratchata Duck (a Chef Special) to share.  \n\nThe soups were hot, spicy, loaded with veggies, and a great way to commence.  My taste buds were on alert to the complexity of each spoonful.  The Calamari had a beer batter that seemed a little off for the dish as it created a coating around the calamari rings that easily separated from the crustacean and made the eating a bit disjointed.  Still, it was very fresh and the Sriracha/sweet&sour peanut sauce was good enough to eat by itself. Nothing was left behind.\n\nThe star of the show was the Duck.  Its skin was crispy and the meat perfectly tender and moist.  The Mango/Tamarind mix that created the sauce that covered the bottom of the platter was simply exquisite.  So glad for the rice to absorb every drop after the duck was gone. Sweet/tart/creamy. There was ample sliced canard on the plate for two, and even a drumstick bone underneath for me to pick up and gnaw off the slim morsels.  \n\nThis was a thoroughly enjoyable and memorable dinner.  It put me in an excellent frame of mind to such an extent that we decided to have their Thai Tea Ice Cream for dessert.  It too, was revelatory.  How many times have I had Thai Iced Tea and never considered taking it the next step?  So glad someone around here had done so.  I mite expensive at $6. for a big scoop, but a great way to end a wonderful meal. \n\nRevisiting Ratchada is as desirable as it is inevitable.",

If you're looking for some zinc to enhance immunity, or K2 to offset possible bone density loss due to the extra D2 taken in this Age of Covid, or just stocking up on healthy frozen food, Bunn's is your little slice of heaven. \n\nThe staff is very knowledgeable about their inventory and will gladly walk you to the part of the store where your needs are answered, and provide explanations for the available choices. I found them particularly useful while attempting to purchase the correct dosage of a mineral recommended in reading I had done on the subject of enhanced immunity, and learned that a low dose would be more effective than a higher one of one element due to side effects. Always good to know.\n\nBunn's does enough volume to carry their own label vitamins at a excellent discount to the national brands. They built a new center for their business several years ago, which while still small by comparison to other retail spots, is expansive enough to carry what most people want in a clean and friendly environment. \n\nIn a difficult economy where many of these small local shops are closing, Bunn's is surviving fairly well and will hopefully continue to do so.",

    "text": "Excellent bagel joint in Doylestown Borough. Small customer area, with room in back for ovens, preparation, storage and display case. The rounders have a crisp biting crust, while the inside has enough air pockets to keep it fairly light enough to allow the flavor of the topping (roast onion flakes) or whatever is added in the prep(butter & Swiss) to come through strongly. \n\nI appreciate the bagel baker who knows not to knead the dough too long, which hardens the bread and makes it too dense. Too, here they are boiled and then baked in the right proportion to create the optimal bagel. \n\nHaving La Colombe and Ellis Coffee in house is also a big plus, as they are both top shelf Philadelphia roasters that have found success nationally and internationally.\n\n These Borough guys are not fooling around. They give their customers quality bagels and first class java for a fair price. It wouldn't surprise me if their success was assured and they grew their enterprise as far as they wanted to take it.",

    "text": "Now I remember why it is best to seek treatment at a world class teaching hospital, than to accept second best from suburban medical providers. They just know more and practice at the highest level of competence and integrity. \n\nSo, when I sought a second opinion before agreeing to a lithotripsy, I scheduled an appointment with Victor Carpiniello, M.D., on the 19th floor of Penn Medicine Washington Square, this week. Impressive offices and even more impressive people there, from reception through Dr. Carpiniello, and everyone in between. There was little wait to see the doctor after completing the standard forms/questionnaires.  He came into the examination room with a warm smile and years of experience. He knew what I was dealing with and the treatment options. If I wanted, he could take care of the condition later in the week on an outpatient surgical basis. I liked the way he talked to me, and his calm demeanor throughout. \n\nWe agreed to take care of business when suggested, but he wanted me to first have a cardiac clearance as a precaution because of my medical history. That was scheduled for two days later. Turned out, before undergoing general anesthesia for kidney stones, I would need a stress test (which I was due for anyway). That takes place tomorrow. \n\nGiven the unexpected twists and turns this situation has already taken, my decision to seek more information from a higher authority was the right one.  It is difficult to express the increased concern knowing the extra steps that are required to protect my health, while balanced by the sense of confidence and relief I also feel knowing I am in the best hands possible. No knock on my regular urologist who has tended to me for many years, but knowing I am being treated by a leading authority on these conditions; someone who is teaching other doctors how to do these procedures, offers a security blanket that makes going through all this much easier to accept, and sleep at night. \n\nWill update this review as all the steps take place and I come out the other end.",

Neon on Hanover Street, Tremont  Lounge on East State, The Famous also on East State closer to Montgomery.  These establishments' handmade patties and local Colonial Bakery rolls were the stuff of legend. Not even the original Rossi's in the Burg could hold a candle to these masterpieces, unless you valued immense size over eye rolling OMG juicy substance. (It was Neon that introduced me to horseradish to perfect a burger.)\n\nThose vaunted halls have gone to Valhalla to feed the gods.  Lucky deities. \n\nWhat generated these meat puck reveries was lunch today at Checkers, the dive bar/resto on S. Warren Street. The reviews spoke glowingly about the open grill kitchen and in hushed tones about the burgers. Would I be fortunate enough to s\u00e9ance with the burger-essence of yesteryear? The First Bite would tell the tale.\n\nI took a big one and broke into a smile.  Excellent fresh ground beef, hand shaped, grilled to the desired medium finish, nicely saut\u00e9ed sweet onion on top, well melted American cheese in between, and light local bakery roll holding it all together.  The taste was so pleasurable that I closed my eyes for a moment to savor it completely.  Just the right amount of grease to assure proper digestion.  The side red potato salad was homemade and without too much mayo. \n\nWhile it wouldn't be fair to directly compare a Checker's Burger with those of its Trenton ancestors which have attained divine status, the fact that this experience brought those sainted heroes to mind is serious praise, indeed. Next time I'll request horseradish and see if the reality comes closer to the blessed memory.",

Drivers License; not the funnest task in a bureaucratic world.

When I arrived at the Bensalem Service Center and beheld the multitudes waiting to be helped, I momentarily lost buoyancy.

She advised that there was a Photo License Center on Oxford Valley Road, that had no waiting most of the time.  She estimated it would be at least 30 minutes before anyone would talk to me in Bensalem, and recommended I drive right over to Fairless and take care of business.  \n\nI did so.

When I walked in, I was greeted by a short man (from central casting), wearing a backward baseball cap and speaking with a warm Spanish accent.  I asked if there were any slices of tomato pie available.  He apologized for not having any at the ready, but immediately offered to make a personal size TP for me if I had 10 minutes to wait.  Of course I did. \n\nI watched as he retrieved an aluminum dough container, peeled out the slowing rising mass and slapped it onto his cool granite countertop.  Fingering, spreading, stretching, spinning, tossing it just enough to get it to the right size without over-manipulating it to toughen the finished product.  He laid out the mozza neatly around the disk, and then flicked globs of chunky tomato sauce on top like he was Michelangelo in his abstract period. Satisfied, he slid his wooden long handled pizza mover underneath, turned, and gently shook it off onto the hot oven floor.  \n\nAbout 8 minutes later he was walking toward my table with a steaming large plate on which sat my personal Tomato Pie.  It was beautiful and its heat wave struck my nose and eyes at the same instant, causing me to catch my breath and shed a small tear.  \n\nI picked up the first wedge and held it for a moment.  It was straight and true, never wavering nor bending under the weight of the topside.  The under carriage was beautifully scorched, but not burnt.  First bite was amazing. My teeth cut through the tomato and cheese and felt the heat on my upper palate. My lower jaw clamped down, closing mid slice on a crisp firm crackery crust.  \n\nMagnificent!\n\nI had intended to eat half and bring home the rest, but it was so perfectly balanced between taste, texture and eye-rolling excellence, that I knew it would lose something essential if I did not eat the whole thing at that moment.  So, I did, and skipped dinner that night. \n\nIt's hard to tell if this experience could be duplicated, or if I had just stumbled into a apex moment that was beyond everyone's ability to recreate.  Regardless, this time was mine, and I offered thanks for having lived this one.",

For rock hounds this is the pilgrimage you yearn to make at least once in your life.  \n\nFor those of us with businesses in gems and jewelry, it is nearly a \"must go\" if you want to see what is being taken out of the ground around the planet, and what very creative people are doing with them.

My focus has been colored gems and stones (aquamarine, peridot, spinel, tourmaline, topaz, varieties of agate), while offering pieces that I found on buying trips to Mexico and Asia, both natural and antique.  \n\nIt is a wonderful high to surround myself with these beauties of nature for a week, and allow their glow to filter into the mindspace where new ideas generate.  And, when not exploring the multitude of temporary shops set up in motels, or campgrounds around town, Tucson itself offers excellent diversions via great restaurants, parks, and hotels.

    "text": "The first thing noticed entering Coffee House Too was how the people working there embrace your presence. From Josh the manager, to Channelle (#5) our server, right to the guy bussing the tables, everyone made a nearly superhuman effort to welcome us and show something of their personalities. Under some circumstances that could have felt cloying, but with these folk it was totally genuine and not overdone. \n\nThe dining area was up a narrow steep flight of stairs with the names of Philly neighborhoods written on the risers.  Good idea for keep our eyes where we were walking to avoid missteps.  The second story was bright with windows facing east, and yellow/gold painted walls all around. Lots of chachkas and potted plants. Channelle was to us in a blink, offering great coffee and mimosas/bloodies/orange juice.  The breakfast menu was a large page with their signature dishes - Hangover Sandwiches, Regular Breakfast Egg Sandies, Omelets, Waffles, etc. Even before ordering a Pastrami Omelet and Original Hangover creation, we received two homemade muffins compliments of the house.  Alcohol and bakery sweets gratis, just because...and, Josh stopped by to introduce himself and inquire where we were from and how we knew about CH2. Pleasant conversation.\n\nI'm not a pastrami guy, but my companion sure loved the load of smoked beef, Swiss cheese and saut\u00e9ed onions that filled her 3 egg plate.  My Original Breakfast Hangover Sandwich was a glorious monstrosity of 3 more eggs, garlic buttered sesame seed loaf, cheddar, sausage and their hash browns all in the mix.  Put hash browns inside my eggs and you know one of the keys to my soul.  With the first bite, my eyes involuntarily rolled to the back of my head, and I am told I emitted a low yowl. My inner wolf was free for a moment. Don't remember, but it was that good.  Don't think I bit anyone.\n\nDoubtless, we will return to this or the other Coffee House Too in the near future.  We liked it a lot!",

    "text": "Second Street Bagels is under new management and working hard to up the quality of the rounders exiting their backroom oven. From my first bite this late September morning it seems they are succeeding. \n\nI was fortunate enough to ask the owner where the bagels were made, and he was happy to take me on an impromptu tour of the operation. I followed him behind the counter and through the kitchen door. The large boiling pot was full of brine and the rack was full of aluminum trays with bagels just out of their bath and chilling before going into the oven for finishing. I knew that the boil helped set the crust's consistency, and that lye or sugar/molasses water were traditionally the elixir of choice, but didn't know that brine was an option. \n\nIt certainly worked to produce a excellent bagel. Thin crust. Nice bite. Pleasant mildly salty malty dense texture within. With sweet butter and nutty Swiss slices, it was an enjoyable bagel. Decent java, too. \n\nWish Second Street Bagels well with its new ownership team.",

    "text": "PIZZA REVIEW:\n\nBacco Centro is a three store Italian chain in Bucks and Montgomery Counties specializing in fast casual pizza, salads, sandwiches and larger dishes in an attractive, comfortable environment. Their Richboro shop is the latest addition in the new commercial core of town on Second Street Pike. We stopped in for a late lunch after visiting Tanner's Farmers Market for our supply of fruits and veggies. Cat was our server.\n\nThe menu was interesting, but given the first time there and the hour of the day, we opted for their Brooklyn Pie with Meatballs, figuring we would have a small sample in house and take the rest home for the boys. As we waited, Cat brought us a small plate of cheese garlic bread. It was a pleasant forespice made from their pizza dough, but without plenty a garlicky pecorino. \n \nThe square Brooklyn arrived on a thin wood server and was settled on a wire basket stand mid table. It looked great in red, white, green and brown. First bite impression was crisp, firm and flavorful. Cut into twelve squares the edges were firm and easily held their weight without equivocation. The red sauce was nicely done with strong hints of garlic, basil and salt, counterbalanced by the basil and mozzarella. It was outstanding! The reheat job at home this evening was nearly as good according to the accounts by our sons. \n\nBacco deserves our pizza business given the paucity of quality tomato pie in Newtown (aside from Vince's). If their sandwiches and entrees are as good, they will have a long line of loyal customers.",

    "text": "Aside from the final battle of Yorktown, Virginia, where Lord Cornwallis surrendered the British Army to General Washington and marked the end of our colonization by the British Empire, the most important battles of the American Revolution were fought within 50 miles of this hollowed ground.  The two Battles of Trenton,  Battle of Princeton, and the crucial and tide turning Battle of Monmouth (NJ), determined whether we would be a failed rebellion or a new nation. \n\nWhen the smoke cleared, our banner still waved.\n\nBut, this place was where Washington showed his desperate genius, preparing for a night river crossing ten miles north of where the Hessian garrison in Trenton lay; hoping for a surprise attack on Christmas morning.  It did not go off as planned.  His generals south of Trenton in Bristol, Pa., were unable to cross the icy river and abandoned their attack.  The river spirits attempted to swamp, drown, and freeze our soldiers with a sleet onslaught that almost completely blinded the Massachusetts boatmen who repeatedly forded the river carrying men, horses, cannon and supplies to the Jersey side, using 18 foot oars and iron tipped spike poles to row and push the Durham Boats across and back.  Somehow, where the others failed, Washington and his ragtag army succeeded.  \n\nThe rest is now known as OUR history.   \n\nIt does not take a huge imagination to feel that this moment is still with us when fully present in Washington Crossing.  Most prefer to join the crowds for the reenactment of the crossings, but for me the true essence of history is most strongly felt in quiet moments in the early dawn or at dusk, when it is only me and the River.  Standing still on a cold winter eve or morn, facing the Delaware and closing my eyes, I can feel the weight of the moment that lay on Washington's shoulders.  Sleet in his eyes and dripping from his hat, he had only his faith in providence and his grim determination to comfort him.  If he failed, the grand notion of a free nation died in these frozen waters.  If he succeeded, he hoped to fight another day. \n\nIt is in his success that we can acknowledge that our collective fate hung in the balance.",

Although only 20 miles from home as the crow flies, the trip back in time is considerably further. With its aging stone and wood and surrounding pre & post revolutionary ambiance, this is a travel destination accessable only by fantasy and time machine. It lies in the heart of what makes Bucks County so magical. \n\nOrders are taken at the cashier with options of fresh bakery goods, morning sandwiches and local roasted coffee from nearby Upper Black Eddy. You remember him, right?! Their Kenya mild roast was a superb blend that went down easy with a spot of milk. Kim worked the register and took ordered for the kitchen to fill. I went light with a fresh everything bagel and cream cheese to accompany the java. She delivered it to me at the small sitting shelve under the large paneled window. It was a decent bagel that allowed me to sit, munch and daydream about the days of Moses Doan and his clan of outlaws who lived in these parts as horse thieves and highwaymen at the time of the Revolution. Aside from the paved roads and iron horses, nothing much had changed. \n\nEveryone was very friendly and eager to talk to this stranger about the timeless life in this hamlet. I was equally eager to listen. Never know when you may meet someone who will change your life. \n\nThis is just the place to pause and reflect on important things.

    "text": "COVID-19 TAKEOUT REVIEW\n\nThese are the times that try our souls.\n\nTo grab a break from constant at home dining, at least two or three times a week we pick up takeout meals from either a place we haven't tried before, but has been bookmarked for a long time, or an old reliable that for some inexplicable reason had dropped out of the rotation. So it was with Primo Hoagies in the Glen Roc Center near Trenton-Mercer Airport in Ewing, NJ.\nNothing like a premium submarine sandwich on a fresh sesame seeded torpedo roll to pleasure and comfort a weary heart. And, Primo, the former Italian deli out of Philly that is now an expansive regional franchise, knows how to bring that iconic satisfying experience home. \n\nWe ordered over the phone for curbside pickup and sent the 19 year old who is spending the rest of his college freshman year at home out to secure it. Ordering a Turkey Schwartzie (sliced roast turkey, Swiss, lettuce, tomato, sweet pepper relish and mayo),  Corned Beef Schwartzie, and traditional Roast Beef & Provo Hoagalone, at $10 per, we actually had enough for two meals after cutting them into quarters and mix/match sharing. Our separately purchased bag of uber crisp & spicy Herr's Jalapeno Potato Chips were the perfect counterpoint to the soft semi sweetness of the sandwiches. \n\nAnd, an outstanding mention is demanded for the wonderful bread encapsulating the quality ingredients. Those babies were so delicious with sesame seeds generously spread atop each creation that I could easily have been happy with just them and a shmear of butter. So good!\n\nAs we sat devouring dinner at the kitchen table we were able to forget the seeming war zone coronavirus had turned out peaceful community into for a few minutes and talk of normal things like before this disease ended our innocence. In times such as these, we must fully appreciate such moments together.",

    "text": "I didn't expect that I would be dealing five big ones for this cheesesteak, wings and burger joint in the Richboro Shopping Center. After all, this building had housed a few other restaurants over the past few years, none of them worthy of more than a passing taste test. Yet, D & M Philly Cheesesteaks and Wings, despite its longish and uninspired name, actually provided me with the best steak sandwich I have had in a while, and a very good burger, too. \n\nThe dining room is barebones, with half a dozen tables, and Philly sports teams logos on the walls. I was doing take out, so the clean room was noted, but not utilized. I discovered there was a discrepancy between the printed and online menus, because when I ordered their Three Pepper Steak sandwich and Special Burger that I had seen online, I was being given the right steak, but a different burger. This led to a discussion with the woman taking my order and the chef about what was said and what was heard. The chef was unaware of the online version of the menu, and had not heard of the Special Burger. They both apologized for the confusion. It worked out fine. A new burger was prepared as I wanted it, and the original burger was given to me as well, without charge. That's the right way to handle the situation, and I appreciated their easy willingness to make things right and treat me well.\n\nSo, when I broke open the styro package and unwrapped the burgers, I beheld three beautiful sandwiches. They used brioche style rolls that were rich and tasty, with excellent texture. The Three Pepper (hot, sweet and green) were mixed into a large load of chopped steak, along with onions and mushrooms.  It was excellent. I could only eat half. The Special Burger was a 6 ouncer, grilled to the requested medium finish, and topped with lettuce, tomato, American cheese and Thousand Island dressing. Although not the grass fed/open range beef, it was still juicy and delicious. The rolls really added to the experience with their subtle sweetness and ability to hold together under the stress of huge bites. \n\nAs a family with two sons who make cheesesteaks, burgers and wings a standard part of their diets, it was very good fortune to find this place not too far from home, that was so expert with a grill. No doubt, the wings will be sampled sooner than later, and D & M Philly Cheesesteaks and Wings will be toward the top of the list of places to go when that large itch must be scratched. \n\nJust hope they come up with a shorter name for their family enterprise.  Isn't \"D & M,\" enough?",

In fact, it is even better if you never heard of them and discover this new pizza parlor on New Falls Road on your own. \n\nWhen you do and wait the 30 to 60 minutes outside the entrance for a table to clear, and finally order a pie from a server in black and white, wait again to have it custom made just for you, and then climactically take your first bite, your will know this is something different than any slice you have had before.\n\nThe just right mix of flour, water and salt. The chunky tomato sauce with basil and a pinch of sugar. The high quality mozza that hides beneath the sauce that melts to a soft mellow. All this combined to offer a perfect chew that explodes on the palate like nothing you have experienced before from a \"pizza.\"\n\nNow, THAT is tomato pie! Not the upside down thing found in many joints. Not the pizza covered in heavy red gravy without any cheese. No. This is the real McCoy from Jersey that has finally arrived in Bucks to show pizza lovers how tomato pie is supposed to be done. \n\nBring beer or wine and mange bien! \n\nYou deserve it.\n\nHappy Fourth of July, Yelpers!!!",

    "text": "MyThai Kitchen recently opened on Brownsville Road, Trevose, PA. It is in an old tiny strip with a narrow parking field right in front. Easy enough to get in, but a bit challenging when departing. Don't let that deter you, because once inside you enter a simple dining room with about a half dozen wood topped tables, and honest to goodness Thai dishes prepared with love and attention by folks who came naturally by their skills - they lived them from birth. No Thai pretenders here.\n\nI was there for a late lunch, arriving just short of 3:00 to an empty house. I was greeted warmly by two women, one the chef and the other working the front room. They thanked me for coming, directed me to a table in the front corner and handed me their small double sided menu. I was in time for the lunch special. I ordered a small bowl of tom yum soup, drunken noodles with beef and an iced tea. I asked them to bring the heat. \n\nThe soup was strongly spiced with lemongrass and loaded with veggies, including fresh mushrooms. The first spoonful took my breath away, but I adjusted to the spicy boil and enjoyed it the rest of the way. I asked for high flames and that was what I got. I was pleased they did not make any \"cultural adjustment\" for a presumed western pallette. The noodles were broad and mixed with peppers and other multicolored vegetables. Thin slices of grilled beef finished the plate, along with an excellent opulent brown sauce. Loved all of it. The 10% grand opening discount was another nice touch (without asking).\n\nService was attentive and attractive from the orange apron woman. She stopped by often to see how I was doing and to answer my questions. On my way out I asked to take a photo to memorialize my visit. My wish was granted. \n\nTake a look and tell me you wouldn't return as soon as possible for more authentic Thai cuisine!",

    "text": "The 5 Stars are not just for the style cut, but for the overall experience after stepping over the threshold of Artiva Salon.  \n\nFirst, I was in Chinatown, which always has a slightly exotic (if also decrepit) atmosphere, especially on those narrow side streets between the numbers. Second, the door was tricky to open, requiring a grasp of the latch and hard tug on the knob.  Third, once inside the space seems rather small, with a row of numbered doors along the wall.  Fourth, there is a lot of art on the walls, some quite good.  Finally, there is Ying, the proprietress of the salon and its creative force.  She has a staff of a few people providing massage in the tiny rooms behind the doors, as well as a space for shampooing and scalp massage after the haircut.  \n\nYing has an interesting story to tell.  She began as a television reporter in China, and travelled extensively; somehow ending up in Philadelphia.  She has her art, and decided that cutting hair was a way to express her creativity and meet people.  \n\nUpon assuming the throne I was handed a page of photos of the backs of men's heads and asked which style I liked.  This was my first attempt at a cut outside of a strictly American barbershop or salon, and with my tricky locks I was apprehensive that she could do more than just a generic shaping.  She assured me she knew what she was doing.  In made no difference as I was already draped with no place to run.  Okay.  I wanted an adventure, and I was about to suffer the consequences, or so my imagination suggested.  \n\nFear not!   Ying did a fine job while talking about many things.  Interestingly, she washed my hair after the cut, and massaged my scalp.  Very nice.  She knew how to handle this guy's longish wavies.  The damage?  $10 for the cut, wash and massage.  That is a deal and a half! \n\nNext time, I will plan for a foot massage as part of the spa treatment.   \n\nLow budget? Definitely!  High entertainment and relaxation value?  No question!\n\nI stepped back onto the dimming streets around 7:30, and headed over to Dim Sum Garden for a totally in character dinner.  But, that is another review.",

    "text": "For a Bucks County vineyard, Crossing Vineyards is as good as it gets in terms of beautiful scenery, comfortable surroundings and quality of wines available for tasting and purchase. It reminds of the wineries in Napa and Sonoma with small acreage producing some of the best vintages. It is easy to relax , sample the wares and at least for a few moments be transported to the left coast. \n\nThis hacienda has been in the family for two generations, and the colonial home they live in looks the same as it did 200+ years ago (with better plumbing, electricity and fresh paint). Take a free tour of the grounds and production facilities, followed by a sit down on the patio in good weather to sip their award winning reds, whites and blushes. \n\nThe most engaging choice is the dark rouge and somewhat sweet and dusky Chocolate Cherry Truffle. The Viognier white, Cabernet and Merlot also merit consideration. While head on comparisons with California wines may not grade out well in every instance, they are competitive, and save the time and treasure of traveling west. Sometimes a pleasant afternoon is all you need to get away. \n\nIf you enjoy Crossing Vineyards it can be just the start of a magical mystery tour of the other Bucks County wineries that can make for a great weekend.",

Finding their parking lot behind the building after cruising by the storefront, I walked in to a warm smile from the owner/server, who directed me to a deuce along the wall, a discreet distance from the two occupied tables. She went to the rear cashier area and returned moments later with a glass of water and the two menus available for dinner and lunch specials. She quietly explained the two lists and left me again to give me time to consider my choices. \n\nI went with the afternoon combo - a small cup of coconut lemongrass soup (Tom Ka) veggied up with fresh mushroom on top, a bisected spring roll with dark orange dipping sauce, and a fairly large plate of Pad Kee Mao (Drunken Noodles). Liking spicy food, I opted for the \"Thai Spicy\" end of the heat spectrum. It did not disappoint. It added burn sufficient to make my tongue sweat and nose run, stopping just short of numbing my gums. Certainly no compromise for this western pallette. Loved every morsel of the thick noodles, chicken, green & red pepper, onion and green beans. \n\nBy the time I finished I was alone but for the pleasant owner. We talked for a few minutes about her business and our experience in Thailand. It was a genuine and interesting exchange, and an unexpectedly provocative dessert.",

    "text": "If you love old school urban street corner restaurants, you are going to think you died and went to heaven when you step inside Pete's Clown House, at the corner of Frankfort Avenue and Pike Street, in the Port Richmond neighborhood of Philadelphia. It is a tight squeeze going through the front door and passing along the counter, but I found a spinner right there, and had the exalted pleasure of watching the action of the cooks, assistants and servers, as they danced around each other taking care of the hot steel grill and the crush of phone take out orders, while always finding time to chat with those around them with a quip and a smile. \n\nThis is definitely a greasy spoon dive, but in the best way possible. If you are entertained by fast hands and flying knives and spatulas, then there is no better theater in the City of Brotherly Love than a orchestra seat in the Clown House. You watch the action up close and personal, as take out orders are written directly on the white bags that will contain the food once cooked. No need for an order pad. And, if close enough to the grill, the occasional spattering of oil or home fries, or spitting bacon, will reach out to touch you gently, and remind you that there is no extra charge for the grease stains on your clothes. That iron is so full of food waiting to be off loaded onto plates or takeout boxes, that its amazing that the kitchen hasn't caught fire in the 66 years it has been slinging hash to the appreciative masses who have been scarfing their incredibly tasty dishes all this time. \n\n \"Delicious,\" is the right word for the food produced here. That grill is so well seasoned from decades of eggs, meats, potatoes, peppers and cooking oil, that it might be edible. The prices are cheap enough to be downright ridiculous. My sausage, egg and cheese sandwich on Kaiser roll, with a side of excellent home fries topped with saut\u00e9ed onions and green peppers, all the hot java I could drink, came to less than $7. \n\nARE YOU KIDDING ME?!\n\nSo, I had an incredible breakfast, a month's worth of local color, and full bore entertainment from the totally engaging staff, non-stop for the half hour or so I was indulging myself. Although a rookie, I felt at home and one of the regulars. I really didn't want to leave, but I finished eating, and the next customer was waiting to take my stool. \n\nPete's Clown House - One of those places that defines what is so special about Philadelphia.\n\n Definitely, a must see.",

Please forgive my absent mindedness. \n\nHow do I know this is a supermax experience? \n\nBecause I find myself thinking about their excellent bagels even when I don't plan to be there that day, and excited when I know it is my destination. These babies have addicted me. They are my opioids. \n\nThe shop is still in the same location, and too small for tables and chairs. Yet, the master baker and his crew have perfected the onion bagel I prefer - firm skin, soft airy interior, and ample roasted onion flakes all around. When fresh from their ovens, they are plenty good enough to eat just as they come from the bin. If you time your visit just right, you can get them still warm from baking; nothing short of a completely memorable experience. Yet, even on the normal day when they have cooled and wait for your order in their bins, like puppies in the window of a pet store, they are simply a joy to consume with a heavy smear of favorite cream cheese (veggie, please!). \n\nI stopped in today for my weekly fix, and picked up a bag full for the family this weekend. I figured it's time to share the bagel bounty with those I love. \n\nThey do muffins and breakfast sandwiches, too. They look zoftig, but I am more the purest, preferring my bagels the traditional way. Just slice, smear and get out of the way!",

    "text": "Cheesesteak Review -\n\nDino's is primarily a take out pizza joint on Street Road in Warrington, PA. We wanted to eat while the food was prime, and opted to mange at one of the three tables in the front of the house. Son and I were in the mood for steak sandwiches, although the pizza looked appealing.\n \nThis Saturday night they had a three person operation in the kitchen, with Dino on the grill. The room was a bit chilly on an early December night, even with the little space heater. Still, hunger and strong aroma of the beef being chopped and tossed by the chef overcame any temporary discomfort.  \n\nThe sandwiches were excellent. Fresh crusty rolls, huge load of grilled beef made in house and sliced just before touching hot steel to guarantee juiciness and surprisingly good flavor. A work of culinary art. \n\nWe congratulated Dino for hitting the cheesesteak sweet spot, and assured him we would return. Never too far to go for a great Philly steak sammy. And, if the pizza is as good, the beginning of a long delicious relationship.",

    "text": "Apparently, this is the latest incarnation of a series of Banh Mi shops at this location, as a quick YelpCheck shows this place has had several names over the years, while working with the same people and offering substantially the same menu.  As Robert Burns wrote so well, \"A rose by any other name would smell as sweet.\"\n\nAnd, so it is for this small store on S. 8th Street just off Washington.  The space is clean, with about 7 tables, and a warm staff that is attentive, yet unobtrusive.  I had plenty of time to peruse the double sided laminated menu, but I really knew what I wanted coming in.  The rep here is about authentic Vietnamese Sandwiches, Banh Mi, although they also provide Pho, Vermicelli and Broken Rice dishes, along with a long list of VN Coffee and other beverages. \n\nThe fresh ingredients are on display in the glass enclosed refrigerator that separated the customers from the food prep area.  The work on my meal was in plain view.  It arrived a few minutes after ordering on a white plate covered in sandwich paper.  The Baguette was fresh with crunchy crust and soft airy inners. The Grilled Pork was plentiful and cut into small pieces at the bottom of the sandwich valley.  Daikon Radish, Cucumber, Carrot, and Cilantro were piled on top and overflowing.  \n\nI took a bite to start the proceedings, and was met with each of the components as they lustily exploded in my mouth.  Really a great first bite!  I added a squirt of Hoisin and Sriracha to bring up the volume a bit and to experiment to see how they would change the experience.  The Banh Mi was fine as it was, but I can be excessive when it comes to flavor, so the addition of both more BBQ flavor and Chili heat was pleasing. \n\nCaf\u00e9 Tranh Truc also has a few HDTVs on the wall, so I was able to enjoy a rewatching of The Hurt Locker during dinner.  \n\nThe entertainment was free.",

It is very similar to the supermarket at 6th and Washington in South Philly. It has just about everything you need for the complete Chinese kitchen, including pigs feet to fat green frogs, and dozens of vinegars and soy sauces for any dish imaginable. \n\nTrue, the odor of fish on ice and tanks full of lobster and talapia can be pungent, but that is part of the experience and brings me back to the street markets all across Southeast Asia. \n\nIf you need it, they likely have it. If they don't have it, think twice whether it is really necessary. \n\nEven found those Japanese versions of KitKat Bars in strawberry and green tea flavors!",

Luckily for me, I caught it on a great night when everything came together as the creators must have envisioned it.  \n\nThis was a business dinner for four.  As such, I had to be less obvious about my intention to write a review with my dinner mates, and kept my mobile phone in my pocket except for when the Tiers of Taste I ordered arrived.  Three plates placed vertically before me on a stainless steel frame that was tall enough to block my view of the person across the table.  We all exclaimed delightful surprise and I felt justified in taking a photo of this unexpected presentation.  That was just the beginning. \n\nThe Decoy red from Buckthorn was a great pick by Tom.  I am not a wine expert, but my palate is sensitive enough to know when it is being seduced by gentle tanins. Gotta get me a case of that!  \n\nThe Marguerita Salad with Candied Walnuts, fresh Blue Cheese, and Tomato Vinaigrette was a cool sweet tart enjoyment.  My Tiers of Taste choices were Calamari with a Vinegar Pepper marinade/sauce, Pierogies and Stuffed Dates.  The squid was well fried, and the sauce was sweetly hot.  Pierogies with Onions and Sour Cream were softly pliant and offered a mild divergence from the stronger statement made by the calamari.  Finally, the Devils on Horseback (that's right), Chlorizo Stuffed into large Dates and Wrapped in Bacon, were a first that combined the luxurious flavor of excellent dates with finely ground Mexican Chorizo, girdled with well done Bacon.  I am not a bacon fan, but this was an exceptional experience.  It came together very well.  I was sated by this meal, and realized I had just come through a magic door that only a very extraordinary meal can open.  \n\nWinnie, Jeff and Tom all seemed quite satisfied, but because we were having a serious conversation while we ate, I could not bring myself to ask to taste their food.  But, the Crabcakes, Lemon Chicken and Berkshire Pork Tenderloin all disappeared with sounds of satisfaction.  As we walked out we all commented on the exceptionality of the dinner.  \n\nYardley Inn sits at the bottom of Afton Avenue, directly across River Road from the Delaware River.  It has suffered repeated flooding, and now has an inflatable berm that can hold off all but the most ravaging floods.  Sure hope it works, even when patrons cannot reach it without a boat.  It is a sterling restaurant when the stars align and reflect deeply off the flowing river. \n\nLast night I saw a constellation of 5 stars.",

You seldom know what you are looking at, let alone a fair price for it, unless you are in the business.  \n\nHarry Merrill & Son, a third generation enterprise on South 8th Street in Jewelers' Row, does its best to make the experience of shopping and buying from them as informative and relaxing as possible (Let's face it, when spending a lot of money some anxiety is bound to creep in).  They are in no rush to sell you anything.  They ask plenty of questions to understand what you want, and are willing to show you many alternatives on the way to honing in on the bauble you seek. And, if they don't have exactly what you want, they can probably find it quickly and still make a good deal. \n\nI have visited them a lot of late for a variety of reasons, and discovered that Rob Schwartz (Don't blame him for his predecessors choosing an Anglicized name for the family shop) is open and genuine; that his mother is still hard at work and has an amazing knowledge of the Philadelphia gem scene over many generations, and that the rest of his staff is well trained in people skills.  They make the jewelry purchase experience as transparent and no-pressure as possible. \n\nAlways comparison shop, but when you are ready to buy, be sure to visit Merrill.  You may find yourself wishing that you went there first.",

There was a vineyard sharing its wares in a back room, but with the people two and three deep waiting for a pour, I knew the better move was to take a comfortable seat at a small window table away from the crowd, and to order one of Euro's exceptionally delicious bakery gem.  \n\nI settled in, but decided to walk into the retail section of the old converted home to se what was under glass.  One of the owners/sisters remembered me from the earlier visit, and introduced me to her partner in the biz. After a nice chat about their success and desire to expand, I selected a square of Washington Cake and Coffee to be brought to my table.  \n\nThe cake was loaded with nicely spiced apples and a vanilla cake-like mix.  The texture was pleasantly chunky and mildly sweet with brown sugar and cinnamon accents.  The top was a Lemon Cr\u00e8me icing-one of my favorite flavors for pastry.  The overall impact was fun and totally satisfying.  I ate it as slowly as possible to stretch out my enjoyment. Luckily, the front dining room was not too crowded, and I did not feel rushed.  \n\nThis stop at Euro Delights confirmed what I experienced the first time.  This is a fine bakery and caf\u00e9 where the creativity of the baker and the warmth of the environment the proprietresses evoke mark Euro Delights as a one of a kind establishment where goodness translates directly to the taste buds.",

    "text": "Walking back through Skippack Village after Winetober Fest and a Brasserie 73 dinner, we came across a bakery caf\u00e9 looking place in another old house on the main drag.  I wanted coffee to accompany us back home, and approached the front door to have a better look through the windows.  I saw a display case full of attractive pastries and wanted a closer look and sniff. \n\nTurned out that Euro Delights is run by two sisters from Finland who have been here for many years, but still possess a delightful accent and a old world sense of comfort and taste.  The kitchen in the back is visible from the retail shop, and with the ovens just recently turned off for the evening, the aroma of cake and hot fruit and sugars wafted throughout.  Coffee alone would not be enough. \n\nWe shared a fresh miniature Apple Pie topped with Whipped Cream and a dusting of Cinnamon.  A personal pie scaled down to the size of a huge muffin.  Locally sourced ingredients made this an exceptional taste experience. The apple was sweet and surrounded by its juices. The brown sugar crumble on top was fun and firm to the bite.  The crust was excellent.  With the whipped cream adding a softness and subtle undertone, the entire desert was perfect.  \n\nWith the rage over cupcakes in full bloom, it was only a matter of time before a creative baker would take it to the next level - personal sized pies. Maybe this is already being done, but it is new for me. \n\nWe ate alone in the dining area across the center hall from the shop.  It was full of small tables, colorful walls and curtains.  It felt like we had stepped into a time capsule as the d\u00e9cor was mid-nineteenth century. \n\nDefinitely worth a drive to Skippack for Brunch and Pie, or one of the other tempting delights under the Euro sign.  Euro Design has only been open for 5 weeks, but their future is bright if they keep producing wonderful pies and cakes.",

I never thought they offered enough of what shoppers wanted and would pay premium prices for.  I was wrong. \n\nTubby Olive has graced State Street in Newtown Borough for a few years, and has even opened another shop in Doylestown.  Walking in, the aroma of spices greets you, suggesting a casbah in Marrakesh or old Italian deli off Washington in Philly.  Large bottles and metal containers surround the room on shelves, everything labeled.  The staff is very friendly and informative, and takes pleasure in turning a customer on to new flavor sensations.  \n\nThe garlic infused oils with secondary spices are amazingly subtle, and have your palette engaged as if drinking fine wine.

On a fresh salad they are outstanding. \n\nI inadvertently visited recently when hungry, and found myself dipping the offered bread repeatedly into one of the many samples and eating them until I was nearly full.

    "text": "So glad I finally made it here to sample the heat of Chili Szechuan. \n\nMy friends from Chengdu are living in New York for several months, and this was their first visit to Philadelphia. After showing them around the shut down historic sites in Old City (Carpenters' Hall was open), they wanted to see the Penn campus. They were hungry, and Chili Szechuan jumped to mind. Why not give them some home cooking?  They would tell me how authentic the cuisine was.\n\nDriving up Baltimore Avenue for the first time since living at 48th and Baltimore back in the day, I was impressed with the changes on the street.  So much positive street life. And, right in the middle of the 4600 block sat Chili Szechuan.  Parking right across the street. We were in luck!\n\nWe started with Dumplings with Chili Oil and Dan Dan Noodles with Ground Pork. Both were as good as I have ever had. Spicy, succulent, and about 3 Alarm on the Volcano Scale.  We followed with Shredded Pork with Green Pepper (5 Alarm), Lotus Root with Pickled Garlic (3 Alarm) and BenBen Chicken (4 Alarm).  All varied as to heat, texture, and undertone. The BenBen is served cold and in skin.  All enjoyable.  But, I wanted to know what my friends thought of the dishes. \n\nThey devoured almost everything on the table covered with dishes. They are both small people, so I was amazed how they managed to eat more than I did.  Halfway through the meal they asked the waiter where the chef was from.  When he said, Chengdu, they said they were also from the city. A minute later he exited the kitchen and sat down with us to talk about home.  They switched from Mandarin to Chengduese (a subdialect of Szechuanese), and I was lost.  But, through their animated conversation I knew they were comparing notes about their lives here and in China. My friends clearly loved the food.  They exchanged business cards, and hoped to see each other again next time in Philadelphia. \n\nAs we walked out, and the owner/chef said goodbye again, my friends thanked him for the best meal they had eaten in the USA.  It was like being home in their own kitchen.  I took that to mean that they were very happy with the meal. \n\nSeeing their enjoyment, and tasting the authenticity of the dishes, Chili Szechuan is as good as it gets for real Szechuan cuisine in this city.  Some might find the small confines of the shop more suitable for take out, and the single unisex bathroom a bit unpleasant, but if you are looking for the real deal in hot, spicy, numbing food, this is your Shangri-La.\n\n10.27.13 - Ok. Here's the skinny on a comparison with Han Dynasty.  There really is none. While both have quality Szechuan style cuisine, the similarities stop there.  Han D is an upscale attractive forum for taking a date to an impressive dinner.  It is pricey and self aware of the experience it is creating.  Chili S could care less about that. It is in business for one reason - to turn out totally authentic hot numbing dishes that leave you in tears, and wondering when your tongue will come back online.  The atmosphere is basic Chengdu heat, as you find on every street and alley in the burgs of Szechuan Province.  It is small and unassuming.  There is only one bathroom.  You can hear the cooks arguing in the kitchen and the woks and pans banging on the stove.  But, if food is what you care about, and you are lucky enough to be with someone who really enjoys unpretentiousness and loves you for your own, then you can save a bundle tonight, and impress her next week with HanD. Both provide a REAL experience on the opposite ends of the lux scale.",

You sleep in a seaman's coffin-sized bunk in the bowels of the leviathan, eat in the original mess halls, climb and descend the steep stairs, and tour almost every aspect of the operations from the huge 16\" gun turrets to the bridge where its captains directed naval warfare against enemies from World War II through Vietnam and Lebanon. \n\nMy son and I had this privilege when he was a cub scout a few years ago.  While he and his mates had no idea what this warship accomplished in its gloried history, and they were just having fun in an amazingly different reality, we dads who came along looked long and hard at the steel blue gray surrounding us.  We knew where this battle wagon had been since 1942; we listened to the number of engagements in which it had participated, the Presidents who had come aboard, and the death dealing it had dished out and absorbed in the cause of our freedom.  It was humbling and at the same time, prideful. \n\nWhen they talk of, \"Jersey Strong,\" this is what they really mean.  \"Don't Tread on Me?\"  That used to mean something. \"Don't F**k With New Jersey,\" now, that still means exactly that. Asleep on the Camden Waterfront is the beast that helped turn the War in the Pacific into one of our greatest triumphs. \n\nVisit this hero with your family and say, \"Thank You!\"",

The place was sunny and as colorful as a Chinese carnival.  Cues of Asian influences abounded, but did not carry the final impression, which was far more idiosyncratic.  Our server fit her part perfectly.  She was alert, funny, cool and ready to engage.  \n\nWe were here for a quick stop before other errands.  We ordered only three small plates: Pork Soup Dumplings, Roast Pork Bao and Turnip Cake.  The Happy Buddha and Narragansett Beers were worthy companions.  Each dish was distinctive.  It suggested Chinese cuisine, while tasting quite different.  The Dumplings were tasty and fun.  Once the top knot was bitten off and the Miso Ramen Broth sucked out, the Ginger Vinegar was poured in through the vent, making the Pork Filling tart and a joy to eat.  It was a hybrid taste of slightly thick dumpling skin and Japanese infused innards.  Very nice. \n\nThe Roast Pork Bao was large and golden on top.  The consistency was right for a bun, but it also strongly suggested Kreplach to this Jewish palette. If my grandmother had been Chinese and Jewish, she might have created this masterwork.  It was like putting together a taste puzzle figuring out what this hollow doughball reminded of.  The Long Hots, Spinach and Provolone offered the possibility that someone's Italian aunt had a finger in this recipe.  \n\nFinally, the Turnip Cake was the biggest surprise.  It was made from Matzo Meal, Maple and Bonito, with a Fried Egg on top.  Again, my Polish/Jewish grandmother could not have done better.  It played with my tongue; teasing me to decide what it was all about.  It was delicious, but decided not Chinese.  \n\n\"...a Willing Mind and a Willing Stomach,\" \n\nYeah! You got that right.",

    "text": "The Benjamin Franklin Parkway (originally called the Fairmount Parkway until 1937) was designed as the centerpiece of the City Beautiful urban design movement of the late 19th Century.  Often compared to the Champs-Elysees in Paris because of its width and anchoring by key public monuments and edifices, in fact, it looks little like that famous roadway, but is truly an American take on European classical architecture and urban planning, talked about since the Civil War to signify a \"model of an orderly, classical metropolis, crisscrossed by boulevards and dominated by stately groups of public buildings.\" And, true to that description, the buildings along its traverse from City Hall to the foot of the Art Museum, are what make this diagonal slash through Center City so dramatic, culturally worthwhile, and give the roadway its importance and stately beauty.  \n\nThe emergence of these structures began in 1864 when the Cathedral of Peter and Paul was completed at 18th and Logan Square. Thereafter, in 1876 The Academy of Natural Sciences opened at 19th and the Parkway. In 1901 Philadelphia City Hall was finished.  Ground for the actual roadway was not broken until 1907, although plans for it had gone through several iterations until then - delayed by political considerations.  The final design was not approved until 1917, when actual construction commenced. The Swann Memorial Fountain in the middle of Logan Square started flowing in 1924. The Free Library main branch began lending books in 1927, and the first part of the Pennsylvania Museum (later renamed the Philadelphia Museum of Art) admitted its first visitors in 1928. Rodin Museum followed in 1929 at 22nd and the Parkway, and The Franklin Institute opened at its current location at 20th and the Parkway in 1934. Moore College of Art & Design moved to its campus on 20th Street in 1959; the Barnes Foundation in 2012 between 20th and 21st Streets. There are many other buildings along the Parkways length contributing to its overall grandeur.  \n\nAlthough Philadelphia is a city of neighborhoods, what gives this town its national and international identity (in addition to cheesesteaks and pretzels) are the Benjamin Franklin Parkway and all that is found along its length and breadth. From City Hall to the Art Museum, this space is where people meet for special events, from 4th of July concerts and fireworks, to the Papal visit and National Football League Draft.  It has a deserved reputation for a great party venue that has only improved with the new skyline in western Center City and the emergence of West Philly across the Schuylkill River as an educational and commercial center in view beyond the museum to the west.  It attracts pedestrians, bicyclists and motorists to survey its graceful imposing reality. It is a great place for people watching.  The addition of restaurants and cafes within a few blocks of the Parkway, make it also a cool place to find anything from a nosh to full dinner.  \n\nThe only place better to capture the essence of the city is to get up to the Belmont Plateau on a late afternoon and take in the panorama of Center City from that vantage point. You can do both spots as part of one excursion, then come back; find a place to park, and explore the great collections and histories that populate the Parkway.",

    "text": "The Singer One sewing machine purchased through Amazon was a beaut, but came without power cord and foot pedal. A mistake to buy sight unseen. But, these parts shouldn't be too hard to find. Right? Thus began an unexpected adventure in sourcing spare parts in the arcane world of sewing machines. \n\nThe company didn't offer parts on their website, and recommended only their few dealers around the country. Too, they weren't pleased that their equipment appeared to have fallen off a truck somewhere to be scavenged for the missing parts. The old Philly warehouse shops dealt only in industrial strength sewing factory parts and couldn't help out, although they expressed understanding of this predicament. \n\nNext stop was a small sew & vac store in Northeast Philly, who took a $20 deposit promising to order the pieces and notify when they came in. When called 6 weeks later to check on the status, they hadn't received them yet, but left the distinct impression they hadn't done anything but stuffed the $20 in their pocket. (A review of that enterprise is upcoming after I return to get back the cash.)\n\nTwo weeks ago I noticed a small shop in Newtown that handled vacuums and sewing machines. Looked to be a recent addition to the business community. What the heck?! I stopped in to inquire. Greeted by Sandor, the owner, I explained the situation as he listened patiently. He advised I bring in the machine and his expert mechanic would check it out. I dropped off the still boxed machina a few days later. \n\nThe following week Sandor called to say that he could order the new parts if I wished, or he could provide used cord and pedal already in his possession from another job. Sounded like a good idea, and yesterday I picked up the parts and happily paid his price. He actually dropped it a fin in support of the visit to the other dealer I was going to ask to refund the $20. He was sure, as I was, that those guys would have had the parts in hand if they had been ordered. \n\nIt was great to do business with an honest man who went out of his way to get something done out of the ordinary purchase and repair services he routinely offered. \n\nMakes me wish I had gone to him before Amazon and experienced direct satisfaction.",

    "text": "If you have been cruising Mill Street over the past few decades you know that it has had better days, but also that a few brave urban pioneers have jumped into the breech and begun new businesses that seem to be taking root.  Calm Waters Coffee Roasters shows what dedication and imagination can do to turn around a main street in a struggling neighborhood. \n\nThe room is well renovated to feel about 1969, with exposed brick walls, sanded and polished narrow slat wood floors, and a tin panel-looking ceiling, that may not be authentic, but sure adds to the great ambiance here.  \n\nThe coffee is roasted right in the middle of the house and served hot, fresh and new.  Guatemala seems to be the source of the beans, and the owner's TLC in producing a quality product is obvious.  The taste of the java is bright and subtle, and a pleasure to drink.  I will bring a bag home the next time I stop in before court.  \n\nThey call themselves 'coffee roasters' for a reason.  That is what they are here to do.  Yet, they know people want to sit and enjoy their Cuppa Joe, and the room is well suited for a quiet conversation at one of the deuce tables.  Still, it is not yet a caf\u00e9 as the offered accompaniments are not as good as the coffee at this point.  There is no grill for breakfast or lunch plates.  They provide instead a few pre-packaged bakery things like muffins, and a decent microwave oatmeal that they will heat and serve. There is a Panini press that toasts and stripes one at a time. How much better Calm Waters will be when they are able to install a short order kitchen for early breakfast, late brunch and midday lunch.  \n\nRegardless of what the future holds, the present is impressive enough (in a quiet way) to warrant high praise.  \n\nIt has been too long since a Mill Street morning provided good reason to return.",

    "text": "Just had a great breakfast at Bullard's American Cafe on Saturday morning. It took me by surprise that Warrington possessed what I enjoy most from a early day meal - old school charm, slightly worn yellow Formica counter, deeply involved husband and wife ownership with the former on the grill and later working the front of the house making customers feel like valued members of the family. And, let's not forget, exceptional food and warm friendly service.\n\nWe sat on a couple of spinners at the window end of the counter. Paige approached us with a bright smile, bobbed blond hair, and menus. She and the two other young women in black worked non-stop to keep up with the rush that seemed to follow us in and quickly filled up the booths, tables and stools. Luckily, we ordered ahead of the tidal wave, and received our platters in a few minutes. \n\nI went with a short stack of french toast covered in strawberries, bananas and blueberries (red, white & blue). A smear of butter and pour of syrup (maple?) and I was a happy guy. The taste of the egg/vanilla mix saturated the bread and was grilled to optimum; cooked through and through with caramelized edges. Loved it! \n\nOur other dish, Famished Farmer, was a special egg mix with potato, onion, ham and tomato, with a side of homefries; also solid and enjoyable. A black pepper shake or two brought up the flavor. We would ask for Tabasco next time to set it on fire. The homefries had great texture and taste. \n\nWe learned Bullard's offered dinner Thursday and Friday evenings. Meatloaf? Yes! Be seeing you again soon!",

    "text": "Legend tells of a mythologic Blue Moose that traveled the spiritland and Doan hills around New Hope and the north river highlands. From time immemorial it was the guardian that helped those hurt by natural, supernatural and even manmade acts, survive and repair their damaged bodies and souls.  Its gifts to all were amazing strength, nurturing support and a supply of local foodstuff to aid in recovery. It was also known for dexterity on the mandolin.  It seldom took sides. It was only there to observe and assist with sustenance and music.  \n\nOver the centuries Blue Moose has taken various forms animate and inanimate. An accomplished shape shifter, it appeared when the need was dire in a form acceptable in the current cultural milieu. It helped sustain our men during the Revolution, and helped build the longboats that made the Christmas eve crossing. Currently, it assumed the guise of a restaurant in a small old house on Mechanic Street in New Hope, Pa. Always brash, it has not bothered to hide its identity. \n\nIt sits in plain sight.  Caf\u00e9 Blue Moose welcomes all to rest within its aging walls and taste its well honed victuals at any of its tables. \n\nIt was within these atmospherics that we arrived for an early dinner last Friday evening, climbed the stairs to the second floor and took control of the middle table overlooking the open space down to the front room.  Open paper umbrellas hung down gently spinning in the air currents.  Stars were painted on the exposed cathedral ceiling.  Period pieces on the walls completed the sense that we were encouraged to take leave of normalcy and enter the world of whimsy, where we could best appreciate the decompression from reality.  BYOB aided the transformation. \n\nOur servers were lighthearted and sincere.  The menu a prix fixe affair allowing choices in any combination of Apps/Salad/Soups, Entrees, and Desserts that added up to 2 or 3.  Our choices were to share a Warm Goat Cheese Salad; Braised Short Ribs and Saut\u00e9ed Salmon; and a Apple Crisp finale. The salad was a nice green plate with local leaves, Hazelnuts, sliced tart Green Apple and Dried Cherries in Balsamic Vinaigrette .  A round fried Goat Cheese ball was indeed hot, smooth, and subtle.  The parts played very well together and was a delight.  \n\nThe Short Rib was already off bone having bathed a few hours in red wine and garlic.  The meat was sitting atop Garlic Mashed, and under a strong helping of Pickled Cabbage and Carrots.  The taste was mildly sweetly vinegar inspired, and completely pliant.  The Mashed and Rib sauces were blood brothers, bringing the best of both when combined.  Symbiotic to the max.\n\nThe Salmon was a reasonably sized steak on top of small grain White Rice Risotto.  It, too, had a pickled topside that tasted of onion/mango, but was likely something else.  It was finished well and easy to eat, although there with an unidentifiable aftertaste that was less enjoyable than the primary sensation.  A small nit in an otherwise inspired meal.  \n\nFinally, the Warm Apple Crisp was a fun crunchy a la mode mess with an oat/brown sugar crumble that was a joyful indulgence.  \n\nAll the while, Blue Moose played his music in the background, completing a near-epic experience.  His mandolin put aside for a heavy bass line for rock melodies that soothed and awakened appreciation of meal and history.  \n\nAs we stepped out into the snowfall and gathered our memories of what had just transpired, the sense that Big Blue was with us in deed and spirit was palpable.  We thanked him for his faithfulness and skilled metamorphosis into a shelter that was exactly what was needed in this age of doubt and cynicism.",

    "text": "If Korean Fried Chicken & Wings are your desire, then Chicko Tako in the Market at the Fareway in Chestnut Hill should be high in your list of destinations. Not only do you receive the benefits of excellent double fried cluckers in amazing sauces, but also the added bonus of being in a multiverse street fair community market that includes a brewery/pizza outlet, bakery, cafe, sushi shack, green grocer and butcher. So, you can cobble together the meal of your choice with ease without moving more than 100 feet in any direction, and dine in a common eating area shared by all. Delicious and impressive. \n\nMy 6 wing plate with sweet & spicy sauce took about 20 minutes to prepare. I was handed a buzzer to alert me when ready. In the meantime I secured a pint of pumpkin ale from Chestnut Hill Brewery as well as a seat at a long table with views overlooking an outdoor dining area. The place was crowded with folks doing more or less the same as me. When my buzzer started vibrating I asked the people next to me to watch my beer while I picked up the wings. They were happy to help me out. \n\nThe wings were on a beautiful rectangular ceramic plate on top of a tray. They glistened a dark red amber glow from the perfectly pitched sauce covering them. Three small pieces of celery and tiny cup of sour cream completed the meal. Exchanging the buzzer for the tray, I returned to my seat. The six wings were crunchy and meaty enough to sate me. The sauce was indeed both sweet and hot, and twisted my taste buds playfully. The cool, pungent ale was an excellent chaser, cutting through the heaviness of the sauce just enough to enjoy it again with each piece devoured. \n\nChiko Tako has both wings and half/whole cut up birds for sale, and they do primarily takeout from their stand in the market. The people there are friendly and efficient. They know they are a success, yet it has not gone to their heads. \n\nEspecially in combination with the other possibilities in the market, Chicko Tako is a great place for a street food snack.",

If it had, places like New Town Restaurant would be a roaring success spreading its Greek kitchen tentacles throughout the city like so many others who have become household names. Instead, New Town has scuffled along the past thirty years, one family turning out incredible breakfasts and lunches for those who live nearby or are fortunate enough to have found this hidden in plain sight tattered glory of a luncheonette. \n\nMaria and Peter (\"The best cook in Philadelphia.\"), are the front and back of the operation. She has the natural charm of your great aunt hostess, and he the stubbled smile and broad shoulders of a man who has been slinging hash for most of his life. The house looks like it was last renovated in the '90s, with Formica table tops and shiny plastic covered benches.\n\nBut, none of this would be worth imagining if the food exiting the kitchen wasn't equal to the narrative. Believe me, it is. \n\nOur breakfast exceeded expectations. My veggie omelet with added feta and home fries thrown in the 3 egg mix was homemade excellent, with rye toast and bottomless coffee for under $9. My partner in crime went with their lamb gyro sandwich with Maria's famous tzatziki sauce. It was among the best seasoned grilled lamb and white sauce I've tasted. With tip everything was $20. \n\nYes, New Town Restaurant lacks pizzazz, nor any sexy millennial attractions. Developers may even tear it down when the next wave comes through, which would be a crying shame. But, what it has is all it needs. 24/7 authenticity, owners who have lived their lives within its walls for a generation, and real food that just doesn't quit.",

Obviously high quality beans, roasted perfectly by the good folks at Calm Waters, where I have had the pleasure of the joe on several occasions. The roll was delicately sweet with light cheese flavor.

They are proud of their success and happy to project their business acumen onto customers by extroverted behavior that made me feel very welcome. Their willingness to give the history of their enterprise and patiently answer questions, allowed their passion for their work shine through. \n\nI expect to become a regular customer of Finca Cafe as it is less than a mile from my Trenton office. It will be a great place to meet clients and plan meetings with a small group. \n\nMay their coffee always be strong!",

You know, \"I'm from the City, so I know bagels...\" \n\nSorry, I was born and raised there myself (Washington Heights), and I've had some great bagels in all 5 boroughs, but also sampled pretty bad ones in all corners of the Apple; often in the same neighborhood. True, soft water from old wooden water mains helps, but nothing takes the place of a great recipe and patience. So, the truth is there are awesome bagels to be had almost everywhere the proper ingredients and skills are present. That includes just about anywhere in the Eastern USA, and any bakery close to sea level. \n\nSo, not sorry.\n\nThe Bagel Cafe in Delran, NJ, is but one example. It looks innocuous enough in a bland Rt.130 North shopping center in the middle of Burlington County. But, it would be a mistake to pass on it out of a mistaken assumption that nothing exceptional could come out of an oven there.\n\n Au contraire, Mon Frere. \n\nThat Onion Bagel overlain with Veggie Cream Cheese was a true delight. Its texture was perfect - firm crunch on the outside; airy light texture within. Mild sour flavor perhaps from the brief bath in boiling water with brine or lye to toughen its skin, yet not too much kneading to harden its tender heart. Piquant spread to pull the varied elements together. \n\nTrue, I think I detected a soft Russian accent from the women behind the counter. That would give them an edge in understanding the cultural imperatives of a true bagel, but whatever their secret, their creation had me imagining old country roots in the villages outside Kiev. \n\nOutstanding work, my friends!",

    "text": "South Broad Street in Trenton, NJ, is always struggling with the birth pains of renewal. This capital city has had more false starts than a drunk runner waiting for the sound of the starter's pistol. Yet, there are signs of life springing up as a few pioneering entrepreneurs open shop amongst the crepitation of this down trodden burg. Look closely and you can find cafes, restaurants, and now an ice cream parlor flowering in the surrounding weeds. \n\nTrenton Ice Cream Parlor opened recently in this part of South Trenton. It brings color and verve to this forlorn street, with a three table curbside deck and sidewalk cafe feel, new sign and lighting around the front steps, door and windows of this converted row house. Inside, is more of the same stimulation, with the addition of friendly servers and cashiers who are genuinely happy to see you. \n\nThe flavor choices are about a dozen, with Peanut Butter Swirl and Caramel Pretzel my choices in a three scoop cup. It's hard to explain the incongruity of finding creative flavors for cones, sundaes, and the like, where city grime has persisted for decades. Very happy that it is there, but somewhat disconcerting, nonetheless. \n\nI sampled my ice cream as I drove home to Bucks. It was quite good, even if falling short of spectacular. It was creamy sweet with plenty of ribbons of peanut butter and chunks of pretzel, mixed in a solid vanilla and caramel base. The price for this \"small\" cup of three scoops - $3 and change. That's about half what I paid recently for a similar quantity across the river. Clearly, the rent in Trenton is a serious consideration for folks looking for a place to start a retail business. \n\nMy Trenton office is farther north in South Broad, but close enough to attract me when this viciously hot summer demands chill relief. Yes. I will be back.",

    "text": "Remarkable.\n\nSome Italian places are really just about pizza and sandwiches, with a nod to traditional dishes to attract people who want more than a couple of slices or a cheesesteak. Others, have talent in the kitchen, and can turn a beautiful platter, but don't really do assembly line tomato pie. It is much rarer to find a restaurant that does both very well while housed in a ordinary looking pizza parlor for the past 30 years. So it is with Paul's Penndel Pizza on old Route 1. \n\nThere was a steady line of pizza takeout orders on one side of the large room separated by half wall to create a cozy dining area on the other. Only two tables were occupied over here and the trifold menu didn't disclose all the hidden treasures possible in the kitchen. Photos on Yelp showed a good looking chicken francaise dish, but was it available? \n\nYes, it was! All I had to do was ask, and our attentive server Robyn made all the arrangements. \n\nIn addition to my request, we also chose chicken parmigiana and \"Shrimp Our Way,\" a penne platter with lots of shrimp and a delicious pink sauce. Each dinner came with choice of soup or salad, and double bread baskets. \n\nThe francaise was incredible. Butter lemon sauce and perfectly pan sauteed egged medallions. Tender, light and pleasantly tart. The best rendition I have enjoyed in many years. The Our Way was likewise exceptional, with knock out pink sauce over a dozen or more crustaceans and quality pasta. The parmigiana was a heavy load with spaghetti and copious red gravy. Substantial and tasty but a step down from the other meals. The side salads were large, but mostly iceberg, detracting from the other ingredients and house balsamic. Finally, the Italian loaves were the weakest link, with little crust, texture nor flavor. They really would do themselves a favor by finding a better bakery. \n\nThe shortcomings were not enough to seriously detract from what was otherwise a fantastic and surprising dinner. Still, had they been eliminated, this could have been one of the best meals of the year. As it was, it was damn close. \n\n4.5 STARS",

    "text": "The Mann Center for the Performing Arts (full moniker) opened in 1976 in West Fairmount Park.  It is one of the finest outdoor music venues in the USA, with room for about 14,000 people, both inside under the roof, and outside on the grass knoll.  There is no question that it brings life to this part of the city, especially at night, when the sound from a loud band or orchestra can be heard well into the surrounding streets of West Philly. \n\nI was there the other night with my teenage son, who was attending his first concert. A right of passage from one generation to the next, I was transporting him to see/listen to Kid Cudi (Scott Ramon Seguro Mescudi), a rap, reggae, original actor and hipster, where I had previously gone to see Stevie Ray Vaughan, Roger Daltry and Robert Cray.  I was happy to be passing the baton. The venue hasn't changed much in the past 40 years.  It is still an awesome place to listen to music, and mix with like-minded heads.  The place was sold out and had the expected carnival atmosphere before, during and after the show.  There was enough haze generated to give everyone within a half mile a contact high.  Everyone inhaled.  \n\nThe show was great.  Kid Cudi is a first rate musician and showman.  He played for about 90 minutes, despite coming on stage about an hour late.  His band was tight, and all the singers, lights and stagecraft contributed to a first rate experience. Wasn't sure I would like his style, but he was way better in person than listening to him on recordings or watching his videos. He had everyone moving and shouting for more. \n\nMost of the main boulevards in the nearby park were closed to traffic, and it took a while to find our way to the parking area and the main entrance. There was a heavy police presence in the park just in case, but they did not interfere in any way with the happening. \n\nAt the end of the evening, my son and his friend were exhausted from all their singing and dancing, not to mention the inebriants in the air. They had a great time, and scored Kid Cudi T-shirts as memorabilia. \n\nJust hope The Mann is around when my grandchildren are ready to boogie!",

True, it is tiny (2 tables inside and 2 more out front), and it is a dive (in the best sense of the word), but the skilled hands in la cocina tell a different tale.\n\nWhen I parked on the street in front and walked in, a telenovela was playing on the HDTV high on the wall, and several people were working behind the counter. I approached to check their trifold menu and engaged the man who appeared to be the owner or manager. He was fluently bilingual making it easy to explain what was available and then how I wanted my Torta Milanesa de Pollo prepared.\n\nI took a chair at one of the tables, and moments later my lunch was placed before me. It was an enormous sandwich on an oversized oblong roll, dressed in heavy foil at its waist and showing its internals at its edges. Just take a look at the photos. It was an amazing piece of working peoples culinary art.\n\nI maneuvered my jaws for a first bite and attempted to compress the width of this monster to fit more in my mouth. I clamped down full force and cut through its many layers. The flavor of the breaded cutlet, spicy mayo, avocado, tomato, onion, queso and lettuce burst out and had a fiesta in my mouth complete with pinata. It was just an excellent sandwich. Eating half would have been enough for a satisfying meal, but I indulged and ate the whole thing right there. \n\nTotopos has been in business for about three years. The family running it is from Oaxaca in southern Mexico. They give this corner of North Trenton another reason to visit along with some of the other great hidden kitchens in the neighborhood. \n.",

While they could all be more consistent, their overall product tends to be good to excellent, and their \"mission,\" highly worthy. So happens that the experience yesterday at this store was about the best I've had. \n\nThe place was almost empty at 3 in the afternoon. One or two tables occupied and a solitary customer at the register ordering a meal. We had plenty of attention from the friendly, dedicated staff. After ordering 8 oz of brisket for the spouse, I went with a combo of brisket, 2 ribs and sides of baked beans and Grandma's Mashed Sweet Potatoes.  Both came with a square of cornbread. \n\nAs you can see from the photos, the brisket was the blue ribbon winner. It was moist with plenty of dark brown bark. Both plain and wet it was a joy to eat. Great taste and texture. The ribs were pull off the bone tender and juicy, although not as dynamic as the beef this day. A shot of their Memphis sauce helped bring out the sleeping flavors. It was basically pulled pork without the effort of shredding. The beans were full of meat with a strong savory spicy base. Liked them a lot. The Grandma Sweets were over the top sugary, with a topping of melting brown sugar over already insulin inducing tawny tater. Not intended for diabetics, so be forewarned. \n\nAs we were finishing, the cashier who had originally seen us up front walked by with a whole tray of Freedom Fries for us to enjoy, on the house. Very generous gesture which we appreciated, but already stuffed, all we could do is take them home with the rest of the leftovers for later consumption. \n\nWe felt loved at Mission, and we reciprocated the affection for the staff and all first responders and military folk everywhere.",

As you go east toward the Delaware River, you come upon Ely Farm and its multigenerational pork products agribusiness on the left. Its long drive framed by white picket fence escorts you to the large barn processing facility, small retail store, and the old farmstead under aging trees. It is a quite the bucolic vista, worthy of photograph, or at least a deep breath of appreciation. \n\nWalking up to the shop we met several people waiting to pick up their freshly butchered deer. \"Eat what you kill,\" has immediate meaning, as we saw a couple carrying out a large flat box full of neatly wrapped meat and a plastic bag holding a multi point antler rack deer head for mounting. \n\nNot something you see every day.\n\nThe retail space is very small, with display cases showing many of their items for sale, access to walk-in refrigerators, and buzzing workers (mostly family) attending to the customers. It takes a few minutes for a first timer to figure out the process. We did, and ordered Seasoned Pork Chops, Hickory Smoked Kielbasa, Honey Bologna and Ground Beef. There was a lot more tempting us, but we had to start somewhere. Everything was made on site and looked great. \n\nWhen we got home we quickly sampled the kielbasa and bologna. Both had rich taste and we're slightly addicting. I fried up thin slices of the bologna and scrambled in a couple of eggs, salt and pepper. Delicious! Will grill the chops later this week. Can't wait. \nThey are lean cut with thin edges of fat. Nothing will go to waste.\n \nIf the seasoned pork chops are as tender and tasty as they look and the smoked meats have proven to be, we will become regular Ely customers.",

Already one of the most picturesque communities in greater Philadelphia, it has made itself a premier destination with the opening of the Market with the nano-brewery within. Now, it is possible to select from a broad variety of street food alternatives also housed within this adaptive reuse of an old warehouse, but also to wash it down with a decent beverage brewed on sight. They also have a pizza operation right there, with a Yelp deal that draws you a free pilsner with the purchase of one of their pies. These guys do everything right. \n\nMy choices: Korean Double Fried Chicken Wings from Chicko Tako and Pumpkin Ale from CHBC. Doesn't get much better than this! \n\nThe ale was rich with a nutmeg/allspice accent in a beautiful dark red amber liquid. Easy drinking, and a perfect washdown for the delicious wings with their crispy exterior under a thick gloopy sweet and spicy sauce. Cut through that like a hot knife through cool butter. \nThe brew tanks were visible to all, and the folks working the taps seemed to thoroughly enjoy their craft. At $6.50 a pint, it was hard to find anything to complain about. Even found a seat at a community table to enjoy my snack. \n\nKudos to Chestnut Hill Brewery for seeing the possibilities of producing and selling suds in this small market, and extra credit for the town council and mayor for letting it all happen to the betterment of the community. \nThe creative energy here was palpable and greatly appreciated.",

    "text": "There are many Mexican restaurants of the mom and pop variety throughout Montgomery and Bucks Counties specializing is home country cuisine primarily for their own compatriots who miss the wonderful flavors of home. Plates are loaded and prices tend to be low. In recent years a cultural crossover has emerged that offer similar dishes, perhaps somewhat less spicy that provide most if the flavor of Mexico, but for a more Norte Americano palate. Shops like El Limon have very successfully filled that space with folks who want something more authentic than Chipotle, but need English menus to participate in the experience.\n\nEl Sarape is a third kind of casa Mexicana. It brings an element of haute cuisine to the South of the Border Cocina, wrapped in a more high end atmosphere that transcends cultural bounds we are used to. This spacious house, with high ceilings, plenty of polished marble and dark stained wood, and brown ropes (cuerdos) hanging down from the rafters, calls for a reminder that an integral part of Mexican history was its involvement with Napoleon III, who was Emperor of the French Empire in the Eighteenth Century, where Mexico was its western outpost in America del Norte. The empire didn't survive, but its influence on Mexican food continues to this day. It involves excellent sauces, delicate recipes and Mexican looking dishes with French sounding names and haunting tastes. It is truly Mexican, but with a captivating twist. \n\nThis is where El Sarape stakes it claim, and it does an accurate rendition of this style of Mexican cooking. My Chile Relleno (stuffed pepper) was beautiful to behold in its sedate presentation. Neat, yet colorful. The same ingredients - poblano pepper, melted cheese, salsa verde, black beans and three tone rice - all on a white ceramic rectangular plate worthy of a more expensive restaurant. The flavor was full, yet more subtle than I've had in other places. The beans were moist without being dominated by lardiness often found in refried beans of all sorts. The rice was flaky, not clumpy. The twirled chip garnish atop the beans was a textural crispy counterpoint to the soft black semi mashed mound beneath. \n\nI was there for late lunch and wasn't thinking dinner. I sat at the bar and received excellent service from the bartender as he prepare for the evening crowd. I would certainly return for dinner if in the area, although the drive from Bucks approaches 45 minutes, which may be beyond my hunger tolerant distance. Prices are higher than at the other great tiendas, but recognizing the different experience that awaits makes it worthwhile.",

My trusty Yelp showed me Franco's Cafe was only about a quarter mile away up Cinnaminson Avenue. \n\nFound it, parked in their side lot, and walked in. \n\nFranco's is a Small Mexican casa, with half dozen tables, fairly standard menu and specials on a blackboard near the cashier. Daniella was my server. She was exceptionally friendly and said she was part of family ownership. Made sense, because she was totally engaged in keeping me in fresh brew coffee and whatever else I needed. As a first timer, I went with something basic - steak quesadilla. \n\nIt was excellent. Small strips of grilled beef, cheese and jalape\u00f1os, with small salad and sour cream, all crammed and flattened into a large tortilla cut in quarters. It was a healthy chew with just enough spice to keep my mouth fired up. The blackboard alerted to the presence of churros and ice cream as a special dessert. Love me some churros, and indulged. \n\nThey were hot, crisp and fresh; filled with a ring of caramel inside each fried strip of dough. Hot! So hot they deserved a warning, but the burn was extinguished by the Java accompaniment. Yup. Delicious, too! \n\nThere are full platter dinners available here, too. If you live in the area, it would be worth your effort to check them out along with their lunch and snack choices. \n\nFranco's is a casual and tasty 5 Star experience.",

It is a true mom & pop operation that specializes in fat hoagies and deli specials of the Eastern European variety. Prices are ridiculously low for 2021. So, if you're hungry and desiring a traditional stuffed sandwich, this is your huckleberry. \n\nI stopped in and walked to the back of the shop where a large refrigerated display case was full of smoke meats and tubes of salami, bologna, ham and trays of homemade salads and cultural delicacies like pierogi and stuffed cabbage. I ordered a chicken salad sub, with lettuce, tomato and hot peppers on a long roll, and watched as it was made, wrapped and bagged. With Snapple and Herr's Jalapeno Chips, the cost was under $10. That was a deal and a half, and I didn't have to pay for the ton of old world atmosphere that came with.  \n\nAs I waited, I looked around at all the accessories available. Awesome pound cakes, cookies, Cento pickles and sours, and a wall of cold drinks. Service was friendly, even for this stranger, and there were enough old-time regulars to make this place a hot stove center for local gossip. Very cool.\n\nThese neighborhood haunts remind of what America used to be when the first generations settled in and started life in the New World. Now, nearly a century later, they have generally aged well, although it has a hardscrabble feel to them with narrow streets, limited parking, and undersized stores and homes that are lovely, but feel somewhat dated. \n\nLucky for me, I love this sort of thing. It provides a getaway from the continual hassles of modern life and Covid anxiety. And, the sandwiches are great!",

It is not really on Lamberton Street, although it is possible there was once a door on that side of the building. \n\n\"El Chapin,\" is slang for a Guatemalan, so although the menu has a certain Mexican flair, this is a house that specializes in cuisine from its southern neighbor.  And, it is very good.  The lady of the house was taking orders and cooking when I went in.  The menu is rather extensive and it took a while for me to decide what I wanted - everything was bilingually displayed with many photos.  Mamita was patient and when I finally selected the Chile Relleno she smiled and said it was one of the best dishes in the house. I bet she says that for whatever people want.  \n\nBut, she was right that it was special.  About ten minutes later, out came a large green Poblano Chili Pepper stuffed with spicy shredded Pork, Peas, Onion, Cheese, and a few things I could not define, all wrapped in a thin Egg Omelet.  Black Beans, Yellow Rice and a small Green Salad completed the platter.  It was delicioso. Every element of the dish could be tasted and the combination was a full pleasure to devour.  I also had a glass of Horchata, the Rice Milk and Cinnamon drink that is a national treasure.  As friend Marlyn describes, it tastes like liquid rice pudding.  When cold, I find it fun, tasty and thirst quenching.  \n\nAs with almost all the Latin shops in Trenton, they were once Italian joints or corner bars that had seen the neighborhoods change and adapt to the influx of new residents.  Unlike most, however, El Chapin has somehow removed the old rustiness of these places and made it feel fresh and energetic.  It was very comfortable to sit in one of its booths and watch people coming and going.  \n\nWhile I have favored all the Mexican, Guatemalan, Salvadoran and Puerto Rican restaurants that I have sampled to date, I found El Chapin to be about the best of the lot.  \n\nThanks for a great lunch, Mamita.",

    "text": "Trenton Coffee House & Roaster is the epitome of a \"Hidden Gem.\"  Housed in a second story walkup in an old brick industrial building on Cass Street in Trenton, NJ, it has only been open a few weeks, and already has a following of locals and the feel of a 1980's urban loft that has been designed for a community party.  \n\nIn fact, that is exactly what it is.  Abdul, the proprietor and coffee maven, explained that the space was shared with an East European social club that uses this room for its larger get -\ntogethers. The plan is to move the operation downstairs in the near future, to allow for more room and ease of access, especially for those who are challenged by climbing a narrow flight of stairs.  Of course, the added elevation adds something to the ambiance of the sun drenched room; making it feel more private and cozy than a direct walk in off the street.  Yet, from what I learned about the philosophy behind the joint - its local punk rock/street life orientation - moving into an old barroom will not cause any real loss of spatial/emotive relationship. \n\nAs for the Java, it is very good, if house roasted, hand brewed Joe is your cup of tea.  Abdul makes each order as received from his personal stock of prepared beans.  He has overseen every aspect of preparation other than the actual growing of the coffee bushes.  His love and attention to his trade is patent, as he will tell you his coffee story and provide a play by play of how he is making your \"pour over.\"  \n\nThe cast of characters here on a weekday morning was unique and very authentic.  There were hushed conversations and people working with pad and pencil, while I looked around taking photos and listening to Abdul.  The large, \"UNWANTED,\" sign above the barista area makes a strong statement, but I thought it best not to inquire about it yet.  \n\nTrenton Coffee House is the newest piece of the underground arts/music scene in this past its prime capitol city.  There are many urban pioneers about \"Renton,\" that hold hope for the future of this decayed mini-opolis.  If you feel called to be a part of it, stop in for some Java and conversation, and pick up a schedule for the local bands.  \n\nIt'll do you good.\n\nUPDATE: DECEMBER 21, 2016 - Winter Soltice.  \nTrenton Coffee House made the move downstairs to its new space on the first floor. Corner door lets you right into the main room.\nRed & white walls. Gray wooden floor. Roaster behind the counter. \n\nSame excellent java. Same Coolio vibes. \nMorning light through the glass block windows gives it a soft glow that easily shifts within.",

What a difference!  \n\nNot only that, but their tester was friendly and actually encouraged my new driver to take her time, and not worry.  He wanted her to succeed.  So different than the attitude in the other place, where it was obvious the man with the digital pad could care less.  \n\nYes, there was a wait of about an hour until we were reached, but there was only this one guy doing all the testing, and he was as thorough as he was pleasant.  In the end, he gave a passing grade, and congratulated her on a job well done.  He took the time to express his appreciation for how well she had parallel parked (only 2 moves), and that she also needed to always be attentive to all the conditions around her.  Point well taken. \n\nHe escorted us to the right desk inside the center, and from there, a temporary license was issued in a matter of minutes. The permanent license would arrive by mail in about two weeks. \n\nThe rest was all celebration! \n\nIt is not often that a bureaucratic experience like a driving test can be called \"humane,\" but that was the case yesterday in Norristown.  \"Lee\" was all that and more. He deserves an award and a big raise.",

    "text": "If you look at a map showing the Delaware River boundary between Pennsylvania and New Jersey, you can see where the southbound river makes a sharp turn to the west, creating the 'neck' geographic feature of the Garden State and the elbow of Bucks County, PA. jutting into it's eastern neighbor. This part of the region is dominated by the ancient flood plains of the Delaware. Driving through feels more like the Louisiana bayous than the Northeastern states. There is alot more water than dry land in these parts, with narrow spits of land for roads and a few homes surrounded by lakes, ponds, marshes and of course, the Mighty Delaware. \n\nThe folks around here have resided in this water world for generations. They are a tight community. When they want to socialize, Darby O'Gill's is where they meet to talk, drink, eat, play and inebriate. Yeah. It felt a little strange walking in for the first time with everyone looking up and following my steps to the square bar in search of a stool. But, my Eagles ballcap and 6'4\" smile gave me a pass for the moment, so they just stared and waited to see what happened. \n\nThe barkeep, Desiree, yanked me a pint of Yuengling Octoberfest, and asked to run my credit card before taking my food order. The lager was excellent. \n\n \"I don't know you, honey. Have to be sure you can handle this.\" \n\n\"No sweat. House rules are fine. Do what you gotta do.\" \n\nShe returned with a more relaxed countenance and handed my card back to me. The sound of conversation and football games on the TVs returned to the room. I ordered their Paddy Melt and sipped on the dark rusty ambered brew. \n\nThis joint was the diviest of taverns. Operated by Darby since 1998, and housed in a large building considerably older than that, it had been decades since it was cleaned thoroughly. The underflooring was exposed in many places and the knotty pine paneling was grease and beer splattered.\n\n Almost Heaven. West Virginia. \n\nThe grilled sandwich was pretty good with loads of sauteed onions and crunchy rye holding a half pound of burger and melted swiss. The ketchup was watery, but what the hey? It tasted good and was filling with a shovel of fries for an extra buck. \n\nI paid with a reasonable tip for Ms. D, and walked out into the cool bright late afternoon sunlight. The parking lot was as torn up as the barroom floor. There was a ragged trailer park out back that appeared to be in the same condition as everything else around there. \n\nAs I found my way out of this strange wet and desolate area, I was amazed that this place was part of contemporary Bucks County, and not a piece of land that time forgot.",

There are many Penn doctor offices there, but I was only interested in the Department of Radiology on the first floor. \n\nTurned out that this office was very well run. I made the appointment online through mypennmed.com for the same afternoon. On arrival I signed in and was seen by the intake person within five minutes. After showing my photo ID and insurance card, I went to the waiting room until I was called for the x-ray. In less then ten minutes the technician walked into the waiting area, called my name, greeted me, escorted me to the changing area and handed me a gown needed for the picture. Once done, we went to the radiology room and took the shot. \n\nI was dressed and out the door from beginning to end in no more than 25 minutes. \n\nEveryone I dealt with was friendly, accommodating and totally professional. I love going to Philly for best medicine at Penn, but getting an x-ray at one of their satellites make so much sense, especially with the digital images going directly to my doctor for his review.

There is no Stella @ Stella's House Blend Cafe. \n\nBut, there is a Tiki (goddess) running the show, and she has the joint jumping. It was a capacity crowd at 10 am on Labor Day. The old 19th Century corner building in the heart of Sellersville, Pa, is as busy now as it ever was. The first floor occupied by this breakfast/lunch house has been brought back to life with TLC and a vision.  Have a good kitchen and they will come. They do, and they did.\n\nI found a seat at the counter between two big fellas, and felt a moment of guilt being alone and able to skip the queue waiting for tables. It didn't last long. From my perch the kitchen was visible, and I could watch to servers at work. Teamwork!\n\nMy French Toast with Strawberries and Blueberries was made from multigrain bread as they were out of Texas Toast by the time I arrived.  No problem.  Done right, FT pleases me in almost any form.  This rendition was very good.  I also asked for the real Maple Syrup, a $1.50 extra, because there is little point to eating great FT with run of the mill pancake syrup.  The Maple enhances, while the sweet corn syrup used by Log Cabin and the like, diminishes the flavor of the dish.  \n\nThe plate arrived loaded with bread and berries.  Gorgeous!  The side of Bacon I requested well done, was precisely that.  Firm, crunchy and with a splash of Maple, a delicious complement to the main.  Everything tasted very fresh, and their local sourcing policy seemed to be working well.  Same with the java.  Local roaster makes awesome joe.  Strong. Savory. A touch of milk to take the edge off.  \n\nStella's House Blend Caf\u00e9 would seem to be about the coffee, but that would deny the strength of the menu, and the skill in the kitchen.  Just about everything about this joint is fun and affirming.  \n\nHey, Tiki!  I really like what you've done with the place.  A wonderful place to end a beautiful September drive in the country.",

And, from the look of the place, the Green Mermaid spared little expense in designing this java joint. It is large, bright and original.  Cut in a triangular shape at the corner of Front Street and South Warren Street, on the first floor of a State office building, the two outer walls are all glass, and both are lined with comfortable sitting areas for work and conversation.  The back walls are painted with colorful murals of famous cityscapes - including the famous Trenton Makes Bridge across the Mighty Delaware River to Pennsylvania. \n\nThe coffee is standard Starbucks (not my favorite), but there is something to be said for consistency.  Their reliable snacks are present, and the service is friendly, knowledgeable and efficient. Everyone gets \"TO GO\" cups, even those hanging out, to save on losses. \n\nI enjoyed the fact that this beautiful facility was actually in this Sad Sack city, as much as I enjoyed my latte and slice of lemon pound cake.  I watched as people filtered in and out.  No one seemed to be taking the space for granted.  The gold balloons didn't let that happen. \n\nI allowed myself a moment of pride and gratification for this city that has been down so long that Starbucks is a very big win. Let's hope it is the beginning of a renaissance that has been awaited since Washington surprised the Hessians on a cold Christmas morn.",

    "text": "There is a simple reason almost all the reviews for The Dutch on S. 4th Street are 5 Star. They deserve every star they get! \n\nI am not a regular part of the weekend breakfast/brunch scene in Philly, but given a reason to be in the Pennsport neighborhood early on a Saturday morning, I willing partake of this lovely cottage industry.  The small corner shop is bright and airy, even on an overcast day.  Pale and deeper blues offset the whitewashed walls, giving the feel of happiness and cleanliness.  There are two levels.  Dining room in the front of the house with around 10 small wood top tables, and a step up in the rear with a traditional counter and semi-open kitchen.  The owners are very hands on, supervising, serving, cashiering and hosting.  The \"Double Wilkum\" hex suits the personality of this place. \n\nWe walked in around 8:30 to a half full room.  We were shown to one of the small deuces toward the back of the dining area, and had a fresh large cup of java steaming my glasses in less than a minute.  The menu is short and sweet.  But, don't be misled by its list of offerings that look like any other hash house.  Hidden within the deceptively simply names are the creative energies of these \"Dutchmen.\"  \n\nMy Huevos Rancheros was not very South of the Border, but certainly tipped their sombrero in homage to the venerable dish.  Rather than tortillas, upon a base of Corn Meal Waffle were placed a shiny Sunny Side Up Egg, melted Cheese,  Fresh Tomato Salsa, Guacamole, Black Beans and well grilled and pressed thick cut Bacon; covered in mild Hollandaise.  Pretty as a picture on the plate, the assemblage had a great taste, if not overwhelmingly Mexi heat.  I never thought of corn and waffles in the same breath, but it worked like a charm.  It held all the component parts together, and sent the meal in an unexpected direction.  \n\nMy companion's Ham & Eggs with 3 Over Easys, interestingly delicious Hash Browns, and thick sliced Marble Rye, was devoured with little offered to me to taste.  I did manage a couple of sly bites when she went to the WC, and understood why she was not in a particularly sharing mood.  \n\nThis neighborhood is gentrifying, but still maintains its authentic South Philly personality.  On a less muggy day, sitting at the sidewalk tables would be a nice way to watch this part of the world go by.",

A good indication of its authenticity is the near totally Mexican customers shopping and eating there. Walking around the packed space it was clear that this was a family destination, with cakes and cookies for those with sweet teeth, and a broad menu for the rest of us seeking a more balanced diet. It was truly impressive.\n\nI was seated at a deuce facing the refrigerated display of sliced cakes, all with large strawberries or other fruit and colorful icing. Tempting, but I knew better than to start with dessert. So, I selected a plate of a large cheese stuffed poblano chile with yellow rice and beans, and small watermelon juice. Service was friendly and easily bilingual. \n\nThe meal was made with all fresh ingredients and was delicious. It was covered in a red sauce that tasted like it had been blended and spiced just before pouring. And, the watermelon juice was cool, sweet and so refreshing - like sipping through a straw right out of the melon. \n\nAll the while I watched little kids and their parents looking at all the sweets, buying them, and carrying them out in small boxes and bags for consumption at home, or in house dessert. Not really sure who was going to eat all I saw purchased, but next time I'm going to borrow my neighbor's kids and let them lead me around to those beautiful cakes and buy a few for me. \n\nGoing to El Primo Plaza is crossing the border without need of passport, nor dealing with DHS.",

Apparently, when health consciousness is a priority, local sourcing predominates and the offerings change with the seasons, you have created a flexitarian restaurant. So, although its stainless steel & glass shell suggests a traditional Jersey diner experience awaits, in fact nothing could be further from the truth. This is a new age epicurian delight on par with the Turning Points of the world, without the pretense and only some of the accompanying cost. \n\nMy Country Griddle breakfast (scrambled eggs, onion, green pepper, morning sausage, mushroom, potato and 2 tone melted cheddar) in a large bowl with fresh biscuit on top, was delicious and filling. The coffee was hot and strong, with a small pitcher of cold milk provided at my request (may have been from Amish cows). From my perch at the counter I could see into the kitchen where the white hats seemed to be having a good time. \n\nEven if you don't know anything about flexitarian kitchens, you can find your way to a very pleasurable meal @ Silver Diner. \n\nNice going!",

The joint is a museum of cultural artifacts from the early days of television, with large posters of Rebel Without a Cause, James Dean, and Seven Year Itch, Marilyn Monroe. Perhaps that's why the room was full with retirees and people over the age of 70 (except for those of us needing to eat and run). This place is the original greasy spoon, for all the right reasons. \n\nThe double \"U\" counter separated the kitchen from the dining room. My spinner faced the grill operated by two short order cooks who worked smoothly in tandem. I ordered coffee and Jem's Scramble with feta and rye toast. The full insulated carafe of java set in front of me was a nice touch. I listened to the repartee between customers and servers. It was familiar and entertaining. Most everyone seemed to be a regular. \n\nI noted the pile of chunk cut red bliss potatoes and metal tray of bacon on the grill.

I also saw that the grill was not scaped clean between orders, allowing residue from everything grilled there to build up and become part of the next dish. No judgement. Then, my small Scramble arrived, steaming in my face and fogging my glasses. Smelled awesome and looked like a gently beckoning glistening syren. \n\nIt was delicious. The eggs held the sausage, onions, peppers and feta in a wet/warm embrace, allowing each forkful to hang together with all elements dancing on my tongue. There was also a hint of everything else that came before, making for a mysterious, yet very pleasant flavor. \n\nMaybe that is the house secret to success, or just how it accidentally became an amazing greasy spoon. Intentional or not, Jem's has a full house every morning, and is definitely doing something right.",

It is hard to find in Logan Square Shopping Center, but if you drive around back on the eastern side the rear door and sign are visible as the best way in. \n\nStarted 35 years ago by the same family running it now, the place has an easy Americana coziness and knotty pine charm that makes for a relaxing environment. The menu is similarly built on kitchen classics, with one side for morning victuals, and the reverse, lunch. I was the second customer when I walked in around 9:20. I liked the country vibe and took a table in the front corner under the windows and across from the cashier counter and kitchen entrance.\n\nTheir french toast was constructed from a thin cut croissant, and included fresh cool sweet butter to melt, real grade A dark maple syrup and two bacon slices. It was all very good, as was the bottomless coffee mug. Service was beautifully provided by Michelle, daughter of the owner/chef of the house. They both seemed to know all their customers, but me, and came out to greet everyone and catch up of the daily New Hope gossip.\n\nOne of the benefits of Logan Square is that it is not downtown in tourist centric New Hope. Rather, this is for the locals, with real quality and reasonable prices.",

The Langhorne store is the closest to home, but we did not shop in any of their warehouse sized facilities. \n\nThe experience was a breeze from start to finish. We saw a wood ensemble that we liked and the price was discounted for the coming Black Friday sales. We ordered it and arranged for delivery two days later. They called ahead in the appointed day, and arrived on time. The two guys were friendly and professional. They set everything up and took away all the packing materials. They were done in about 20 minutes and our dining room looks great. Everything was in perfect condition and makes the room pop. The chairs are wood and leather, quite heavy and surprisingly comfortable. \n\nWe easily qualified for their 12 month payment plan with no interest if paid in full on time, which made it all the more manageable. \n\nThis was my second purchase from R & F, and it won't be the last. They have eliminated the hassle of furniture buying and delivery delay, so that it works smooth as silk.",

With a little spit and polish they have made the original Polish Falconer Club into an attractive reuse that is bright and comfortable, with lots of handworked wood bars and tables, block glass windows, and large coffee bean roaster where they control the production of excellent java. \n\nIn addition to a broad caffeinated menu, they sell a few pastries - cookies, scones and brownies, as well as carrying bags and sacks with their logo on them. You can tell they are really just getting started, but have a marketing plan in keeping with the hard edged neighborhood where they ply their trade. Trenton State Prison is right down the street, where hard time takes on an altogether new meaning. \n\nI asked for Chai Latte, and it was handed to me minutes later in a large cup in saucer. It was well done and went down easy. They were kind enough to allow me to eat a bagel I had picked up earlier. I had intended to bring it to my office on South Broad, but when I drove by One Up One Down, I had a change of plans and wanted to take a little time on a chill Friday morning to enjoy a diversion. \n\nSpontaneity completely made my day, even if I wore my mask in and out to honor Covid Protocol.",

    "text": "There is little doubt that Rocco's is the best restaurant currently in Newtown. This may change as there are new kitchens opening up almost weekly in the community, but right now, this steakhouse has it going on full bore. \n\nI had dinner there with son and his girlfriend the other night. We sat in the glass enclosed porch that rings the first floor. The space is beautifully appointed in colonial style, and white table cloths and heavy stainless flatware. It is a pleasure to walk through the barroom and dining room to reach the porch. From that perch the Newtown bustle can be witnessed first hand. We were there to celebrate several occasions that had gone  unrecognized over the past 16 months due to Covid. We had much to be thankful for. \n\nSon o'mine loves his steak, and his N.Y Strip done medium was beyond excellent in texture and robust flavor. He cut me a piece knowing that this was not my normal diet, but that I was open to experiencing superior dishes. Yes, it was amazing, and it was easy to understand his attraction. I had to concentrate to appreciate everything that was going on in my mouth as I chewed and savored. His girlfriend went with a medium filet. It wasn't as juicy as the strip by observation, but she was clearly loving every bite of her medium round thick slab of beef. \n\nI went with the French Onion Soup and Prime Burger, knowing my diet couldn't handle a platter of solid beef. The soup qualified for possible the best of breed in a lifetime. It was rich, savory, onions, hearty beef stock, topped with french loaf under a thick layer of gruyere, seared to a near-blackened finish either in the oven or by blowtorch. The cheese had to be pierced to access the molten potage below, and to permit the superheated steam to escape. It was epic, and nearly a meal by itself.  Stupendous! \n\nAfter all this, the burger was a bit of a disappointment. True, it was a combination of ground beef, short rib and brisket, topped with onion, tomato, lettuce and melted provolone, in a brioche bun. But, flavor-wise it was a situation where more is less. I didn't get off on the mix of beef. It just didn't taste like a high end burger. I like short rib and brisket at BBQ joints, but prefer them separately, where each of their distinct attributes can be appreciated, and not muddled together. So, it was disappointing after the star quality of everything else. The fries were standard crispers. \n\nSo, Rocco gets a less than perfect five stars here. Despite the burger, the rest of the experience was top notch, and the bar/dining area stunning In an understated way. On a less precipitous evening, eating outside would have been a legitimate option, but despite the umbrellas, we would have had to endure wet shoulders from the tropical storm brewing outside. \n\nNo wonder Rocco's is booked solid every night. It is truly a first class night on the town.",

    "text": "Five Guys makes the best grease burgers! \n\nGrilled on steel that is seldom cleaned during hours of operation, the beef sizzles until well done, when it is lifted off the heat and placed on a bun already prepared with whatever accessories you want. Whatever else they do to the body, they are incredibly tasty and provide excellent lubrication to the alimentary canal. \n\nIn addition, 5 Guys make great fries that far outclass their better known brothers. Their signature move is to toss extra fries in the brown paper bag after putting in the primary load carried in a paper cup. Excessive, but nicely so. Same goes for their shakes, which are also superior to the beef pucks. They are creamy, sweet cool ice cream splurges. Pricey, but the super caloric craving supercedes the doubtful overall nutritional value. \n\nSo, it is an upside down meal if you think about it, but certainly a ton of fun on a bun. \n\nUnbeknownst to me, I had ordered online from the Five Guys on Lincoln Highway, but not the road running through Bucks County, A/K/A Route 1, but rather the one in Lancaster, PA., over 100 miles away. My bad. I wrongly assumed that their locations were in order of proximity to where I lived. Not so on their app, so the reference to Lincoln Highway led me astray. You know, I saw what I expected to see (Langhorne rather than the actual Lancaster) and impulsively jumped the gun. \n\nThis is where Five Guys superhero Tyler stepped in to save the day. When the shop didn't have my order, he asked to see my phone and immediately knew what had happened. Not for the first time, he explained. He immediately reordered everything on the register and comped the charges, knowing I had already paid their sister store. They could correct this internally. \n\nTyler's superpower - being supercool and knowing exactly what to do without making me feel like a bigger smacked ass than I already did. All this coolness made the enjoyment of my \"special meal\" almost a secondary consideration. \n\nAlmost, but not quite, as it was digestible proof that some classy teenagers are ready to rule the world.",

    "text": "If you enjoy classic Italian cuisine with a touch of something more modern, set in an beautifully renovated house, La Strada is calling your name. \n\nIts main dining room is a large round room that may have been a solarium in a past life, but has become a space large enough for a dozen or more tables amply spaced and fully windowed to permit the world outside to come in. As this is the older part of town, you can see 18rh and 19th Century buildings that remind of the pre and post revolutionary history of the area. \n\nThe menu has all the traditional dishes, some with a special flare away from what would be expected. For example, we ordered Calamari which came drizzled with a Thai Sweet Chili Sauce and Balsamic drip. All larger rings, it was a delicious surprise treat. Our Chicken Marsala and Francais were more classical, with two large breasts each atop Penne and wonderful reductions in Marsala Wine with fresh mushrooms and lightly dredged flour coat and  Lemon White Wine base, respectively. Tender enough to be cut with our forks. \n\nService was a bit slow, but not bad for a romantic Sunday night. We regretted not bringing our own bottle to this BYOB house. \n\nAside - All through the meal I had the feeling that this was a Roman room in the fine tradition of Trenton's Chambersburg neighborhood, which at one time had awesome Italian kitchens on every corner. They were classy and always full with locals manging to their hearts' content. Those days have turned to Spanish/Latino pleasures, but it's great to know that that Guilded Age can still be found if we look hard enough. In fact, the owners are from Trenton, and seemed pleasantly surprised to chat briefly about the old world, where I still have an office, and loads of memories.\n\nLa Strada is of that fine school.",

My Onion rounder with Veggie Cream Cheese spread, washed down with their House Blend coffee was satisfying and tasted of the love they put into it. \n\nService was attentive and friendly.

    "text": "Ota-Ya requires a bit of patience to find.  Sitting out back off Cambridge Lane in Newtown, it is easy to have never known that this place existed.  It is next door to Mamita's, the new Central American resto. If you don't know where that is, then you need to call ahead to speak with the very friendly owners who are accustomed to directing lost patrons.  \n\nIf you are familiar with the current state of Sushi/Japanese houses; this is not that.  It is an older space, without the front row knifemen flashing blades nor rice shapers. All that creative stuff is done in the back (kitchen).  What you see is the finished product brought to you by management or an on-the-ball server who knows everything about the menu, and will tell you what she/he thinks is de rigor for lunch or dinner.  The floor plan is rather small for a contemporary restaurant, reflecting that Ota-Ya has been slicing fish for a long time without the need for floorshows.  The aura is dark, the tables and chairs old, and the overall atmospherics close and subdued.  Whispering comes naturally.\n\nBut, in exchange for being the anti-Oishi in Ntown you get the best sushi.  Fresh, creative, aesthetic and self-assured.  If you love old Zato-Ichi movies, this is your place.  The blind swordsman sits quietly while the nasty Samurais' steel slice each other up defending their noble's honor. Finally, when the dominant villian and his henchman are about to kill the last innocent, Zato-Ichi excuses himself meekly, unsheathes his short sword, and dispatches the baddies while holding a baby in his free hand. \n\n \"...so sorry for the disturbance, young prince...\"\n\nHave whatever you want here.  It is all very good.  If raw fish is not for you, there is plenty of excellent Tempura, Teriyaki, Udon, Bentos, and Salads.  The owners are happy to chat with you if they have time, and if not crowded feel free to ask for a refill of the Green Tea and sit a while.",

    "text": "It is time to revisit my past reviews of House of Pho, and update my impressions and ranking for this ever improving Vietnamese restaurant.  \n\nReturning for the first time in a few months, the first thing I noticed was the presence of booths along the front windows.  We sat there, and the additional privacy was felt immediately.  Great touch!  They also had moved the drink menu onto a table card for immediate perusal and quick ordering.  Smart move to save the time of waiting for the arrival of the menu.  We selected the Mango Smoothy and Coconut Tuoi, and had them at the table within minutes, and before we ordered the victuals. The Smoothie was sweet and creamy, just as I remembered it, and the Tuoi was a mild coconut infused water with thin Coconut shavings in the glass.  Mildly sweet and instantly refreshing.  \n\nWe ordered the Spring Roll app, Grilled Shrimp with Lemongrass Sauce, and a small Pho Gai (Chicken).  The Spring Roll was cool, crisp and so fresh, with extra large Shrimp seen through the translucent skins.  The Peanut Sauce had a bit of a spicy kick and complemented the sweet crispness of the roll.  The Grilled Shrimp were smaller than in the Roll, but numerous, and arrived nestled in a lettuce leaf.  The Lemongrass Sauce was an interesting taste, less dominant that its Thai sibling, but well used with the shrimp.  It was subtle and I really appreciate the interplay with the light BBQness of the Shrimp. Finally, the soup was Pho-n-tastic; hot broth with large slivers of Chicken Breast and Noodles. The flavor was superb.  This is a clear broth as opposed to the sometimes tawny opaque smoky flavor offered by other pho joints.  Of course, it came with a side plate loaded with sprouts, basil leaves, jalapeno slices and wedge of lime. The bowl was so full when I finished preparing it I had to press down gently with my spoon to suppress the garnish and allow some soup into my spoon. A slightly bigger bowl with the same amount of ingredients might have been a good idea to avoid spillage. Totally satisfying.\n\nWe finished with VN Coffee and Green Tea, so we could sit for a while longer and talk while we continued to enjoy the evening created by House of Pho.\n\nThis establishment has become first class.  It need offer no apology to sister shops in nearby urban centers.  In fact, I recently returned from Garden Grove, California, the Vietnamese capital in the USA, where I sampled a few Vietnamese delights.  None were any better than House of Pho, and some were considerably worse. \n\n5 Stars to House of Pho.  Great work, Fred and Victor!\n\nOCTOBER 4, 2014 - The best places continue to evolve as they find their groove and have the courage to explore the outer limits.  House of Pho follows this tradition.  Their menu is broader as they are now offering special seafood dishes, no doubt putting a creative edge to a marketing survey to see where to go next. \n\n The house remains clean and coolly inviting.  The staff seems to finally feel comfortable with the kitchen genius, and Fred and Victor reign serenely over their domain. Today's Jackfruit Smoothie was so good ($1. off) and my Com Thit Nuong tasty and full of Pork, Noodles and Spouts.  While I went in for the Pho, the alternatives overcame me, and I went with something new for me.  \n\nStill a 5 Star experience.\n\nJANUARY 5, 2015 - Stopped in last night for a Pho dinner and decided to try the Spicy Hot Wings in their Signature Sauce.  They were hot, crisp, peppery, sweet, fat and delectable. A very good complement to the standard menu. \n\nKeep it up, guys!",

Teach skills that can be adapted in the community at large while serving the general public with a food experience that cannot be duplicated in the open market. Learning to be a chef, sou chef, and other professional kitchen worker, creates opportunities for employment not otherwise available to \"guests of the State.\" While they serve time, they also learn to serve customers and cook up some very tasty dishes.  \n\nThe Inn is on the campus of the DOC, in an old mansion converted into a restaurant on the first floor.  It is set up nicely, with plenty of tables in a large dining room.  Windows all around with views of the large facility.  Access is restricted, and everyone must show a photo ID in order to pass through the main gate.  \n\nOnce inside, parking is easy, and walking into the building from the parking lot takes a minute. The menu offers five or six entrees, a few sides, soups and salads.  It is fairly constant for a few weeks before it changes again.  We chose the chicken wing special, Cajun pasta and the Italian hot dog (mine).  The other plates looked good, and my companions expressed satisfaction with their meals.  My hot dog was in fact 2 wieners, with a light topping of saut\u00e9ed onions, green frying and sweet red peppers and roasted potatoes.  The bun was the only real disappointment, as it had no taste nor texture. They could use a better bread purveyor. The homemade carrot cake was highly touted, and was tasty with a nice cream cheese icing that could have been thicker, but had the right addictive flavor. \n\nOtherwise, the service by the men in white chef's garb was very good, and the overall experience enriched by the reality that we were eating well and helping society writ large.  We were told of a BBQ the next day.  That was very tempting, but schedules did not permit such a rapid return visit.  \n\nCertainly, next time!",

    "text": "Brought a dozen of these glamour babes to the office this week.  They were gone in under and hour.  \n\nEveryone wanted to know where they were from as they had not tasted such fresh, chewy, sweetly frosted doughnuts in an elephant's memory.  I only had a taste of two of them; the Blueberry and a Vanilla Frosted.  The former was mildly crisp on the outside, all fruit sweetness within.  The later had a fragile body, but a thickly poured sticky frosted coating.  Each was totally different than the other, as the frosted was soft with a delicious white coat, while the core was much like a well made glazed rounder that almost melts in your mouth.  The Blueberry was more cake-like, but totally infused with berryessence. \n\nMary's is located within the Bristol Amish Market on Green Lane, just off Rt. 13. This market is also worth a review, as it is large, bright and cleaner than the one I often visit in Newtown, Pa.  \n\nOnly open Thursday - Saturday with the rest of the vendors there.  On Thursday morning around 7:30 am, there were few people in the building, and almost no line at Mary's.  Go later in the day, and you risk them being out of one or more of your favorites.  The Saturday mayhem may not be worth the trip. \n\nI think I found its sweet spot.",

    "text": "River Cat is a smooth, soft footed feline. She prowls the rocky Delaware River shore by night, and sleeps in a sunny window ledge while the day is morning cool. She puts on an apron and works in her kitchen as humans arise and visit her for their early meal and cuppa java. An accommodating cat, she knows not to serve those mice captured during her dark hunt. She has learned amazing skills with people food, and shows them off daily at the whiskered cafe on the south end of Main Street in New Hope, PA. What once was a year round Christmas shop, is now a cool, exposed beam, clearstoried, glass walled mellow hangout for River Cat's friends and those wishing to become one. \n\nI took a corner table facing the front patio with its black metal tables and red umbrellas. River Cat approached, blond hair clipped atop her head and menu, small pad and pen in paw. Her purring question about coffee rolled over me like a magic spell, slightly altering perception. I was no longer in a rush, with nothing but the moment influencing me. I watched her move away like the sure-footed chat blanc she was. \n\nWith coffee secured, I ordered an egg and swiss on ciabatta sandwich, and settled deeper into the chair to watch the morning evolve. Folks wandered in. Most seemed to know her and the crew, and exchanged pleasantries before sitting. This meow was popular. \n\nMy plate arrived with a cat's eye smile. It looked wonderful. Fresh roll with fried egg and melted cheese neatly packaged within. White and sweet potato mixed in a hill of home fries. Slice of honeydew, twist of orange and a strawberry as colorful garnish. Not too big. Not too small. Just the right size. Tasted great with a combination of flavors and textures to wake up the still sleepy beast within. With strong coffee washdown, it was a very enjoyable breakfast, and certainly the best of my week. \n\nThis River Cat should do great with the New Hope summer crowds, and offer the locals a pleasant place to break fasts and socialize in the off season. Let's hope success doesn't go to her river washed head, and she maintains the silky coated demeanor she shows in her opening days. \n\nRiver Cat Cafe could be purr-fect.",

    "text": "While most American malls are slowly becoming dinosaurs of a past economic age, there are a very few defying the shift to a new urbanism that incorporates commercial centerism with residential and professional integration in close proximity, by going to the opposite extreme - supersizing the structure and filling it with ultra high end merchandise, and multiple choice cuisines, that create a sense of excessive exuberance that attracts the crowd with so much stimuli that it is irresistible.  Whether it will work long term is an unanswered question, but for now and the near future, it certainly seems to have traction that pulls on the senses as well as the wallet. \n\nThe new King of Prussia Mall, combining the old Court at King of Prussia and the KoP Mall of yesteryear, into one humongous bazaar, is really rather amazing. Its enormity dwarfs normal perception and invites you to visit a rather alien, yet very attractive, universe.  Hermes, Louis Vuitton, Bulgari, Cartier, meld with scores of other lesser known retailers (and some better known, as well), and a wide variety of food outlets that can please the most discriminating tongue and pallet. Bloomies, Macy's and Neiman Marcus are but three of the anchor department stores offering clothing and accessories right from designer showrooms and runways.  Henri Bendel, Jimmie Choo, Marmot, etc., are all there.  More than 450 shops in all. \n\nSo, go if you feeling like splurging. Go, if you just want to get out of the house and get a long walk done for the day. It is all rather overwhelming, like a giant circus wrapped in a vertical city, with enough to keep anyone occupied for as long as they feel the need to be so. \n\nIt will be interesting to see how long this concept works successfully, as it is a litmus test for the American commercial future.",

Whether a haircut at Artiva Salon, a subterranean grocery exploration, or a great meal at any of the scores of traditional regional kitchens, the gritty streets of C'town will find my footprints in the greasy dust. \n\nImmigrants from Fuzhou and the old Canton arrive first starting 175 years ago. A laundry, then a few rice shops, and then a business association attracted more small family startups contributing to what was once a larger neighborhood. The increased density of a five square block area actually adds to the impression of walking through hutongs in Beijing or other large Chinese city. The Friendship Gate on 10th Street is authentic and carries the magic spells for success and happiness. \n\nWhile true that the well to do residents have escaped west and north, leaving behind hourly workers, students and families that can't afford to move uptown, the community is still vibrant, evolving and exciting. \n\nFrom creative bars and clubs to traditional restaurants with roast ducks and pig snouts in the windows to rolled ice cream and excellent teas and coffees, there is something for everyone on these gristled lanes.",

    "text": "Trejo Restaurant on Swede Street, just down a bit from the Montgomery County Courthouse, is a very good casa Mexicana in the heart of Norristown. It has about ten tables and a small kitchen in the back corner. The menu has a full monte of breakfast, lunch and dinner options. The people working there appear to be family and are likely ownership. They are friendly, hospitable and seem proud of their establishment. \n\nIt was late lunchtime, so a small Torta (sandwich) of thin sliced breaded beef caught my attention. When it arrived I knew that the adjective \"small\" was not really operative. This was a mega-sliced opus at least three inches thick, layered with beans, lettuce, avocado, tomato and spicy mayo, all held in a fresh roll with extra long toothpicks. The crisp fries were nice, but totally over the top unnecessary. \n\nThe torta was great. Too wide for my jaws to clench, I partially deconstructed it by removing a couple of layers of the tasty res empanada, and rebooting it to a manageable dimension. From there, every bite was a delicious combination of all the ingredients exploding in my mouth. At $10 I felt bad that I couldn't finish it. Still, it was one of the better authentic Mexican plates I have enjoyed in long while. \n\nThe good news is that my Norristown office is right down the street, so Trejo can become a regular stop when I am here for office meetings.",

There is barely room to turn around inside, but it is so well organized that it probably has everything you want for a solid take away breakfast and lunch.  The folks there are friendly and willing to chat while they do your bidding or take your cash. \n\nI stopped in for a quick caffeine jolt.  I wasn't hungry, but the aroma from the grill, and the sweet temptations from the muffin/donut display sure had my attention. Immediate mental note to come back with some room in the belly. The java was tasty and fresh, and the small cup a buck and a quarter.  Hard to beat.  \n\nRoebling itself is a cool former company steel town that has had its own boom and bust cycle.

The families of those who perished in that horrific attack, along with some very talented and dedicated people, came together to create a one of a kind setting for the somber, yet uplifting, task of bringing us together to Reflect on and Remember what happened on that day. \n\n      We feel a shared emptiness in our hearts from the loss of loved ones many of us knew.  We appreciate the powerful yet gentle flow of the park-like design that guides us along its paths ever closer to its center, the twin fountains in a pool made of concrete, stone and reflections of trees and sky.  We count the trees planted around the low walls of concrete and glass with so many names...\n\n     This is a profoundly beautiful and haunting place. It echoes within, and calls out for love, peace, understanding, and never forget determination.\n\n9.11.2013 - The Memorial Ceremony held here today was poignant and sad.  Finding and giving comfort was the message of the day from all the spiritual leaders asked to speak, pray, play music, and stand silently.

    "text": "Good things can happen even in the middle of a snowstorm, and I survived to write about it. \n\nThe drive from Carlisle to Bucks was getting worse by the mile as snow and then sleet fell and made road conditions difficult.  With the speed limit reduced to 45 MPH, and my head beginning to pound, it was time for a break.  I was thinking comfort food, but when I drove into Malvern and my first choice (Pho) was closed on this Sunday, I found Dixie Picnic just around the corner, and seeing good Yelp reviews, I went in.  It might not be my normal comfy meal, but it certainly was someone's, and I was about to find out who's. \n\nThe space was bright and cheerful even on a dank dark afternoon.  I arrived around 1:30, and they were closing at 2.  No sweat.  The owner welcomed me and told me to sit and relax.  He handed me the menu after explaining the general lay of the land with breakfasts, sandwiches, BBQ, and Box Lunches.  Everything done in house and from scratch.  Home brewed Iced Tea, too.  \n\nI went with the Georgia BBQ Pork Sandwich on a fresh roll.  It came with a choice of a side dish - Pasta Pesto, thank you. While I waited, I listened to the oral history of this Southern family and the old photos on the walls took meaning and personality.  Lunch arrived.  \n\nA huge heaping load of heavily sauced shredded pork that required a fork to consume because to pick up the sandwich was to risk a major lap spill.  It was that BIG. The first bite had me sucking in my breath as the deeply sweet and tangy mix attacked my tongue and olfactory center.  WOW!  This was going to required time and patience as I adjusted to its wonderful flavor.  It had just the right amount of vinegar to provide a sharp retort to the molasses-like thick sweetness.  It was soft and tender and an easy chew.  I found myself enjoying it immensely.\n\nMeanwhile, the staff was beginning to close up, but I was assured that I could remain.  Good thing, because the other hot items were the Upcakes sitting seductively in the front display.  \n\nThese were upside down cupcakes covered on all sides in thick creamy icing.  The variety of flavors had their own menu and were seasonal.  Here, while the cake base was homemade and excellent, the real story was unabashedly the multicolored toppings.  I decided on the Blood Orange Icing on Devil's Food Cake.  \n\nThe icing was about a quarter inch think all around, save for the bottom (Actually, the top of this bottom's up creation). It was a soft cream, rather than a hard shell, and gave itself up freely.  While sweet, it was not overly so, and settled nicely on the tongue for a lasting taste sensation.  The chocolate cake was super moist and almost gooey.  I loved it. \n\nWhoever thought this one up deserves a place in the Cupcake Hall of Fame.  \n\nThanks to everyone associated with Dixie Picnic over the generations for your love of cooking and taking care of people.  \n\nYou all certainly took great care of me, and introduced me to new possibilities in comfort food. \n\nGratitude and respect.",

There are many small enclaves with their own identity and distinct character with residents fiercely proud of where they come from. One of the best aspects of this street by street, hood by hood, awareness, especially from a Yelp perspective, is the presence of wonderful local shops, bars, and restaurants that maintain that sense of community every day of the week.  \n\nTate's Good Food Restaurant on Torresdale Avenue, in this corner of the city that shares the name, is one such iconic luncheonette that serves both the gastronomic needs of the area, and supports the people with quality breakfasts and lunches and a place to gather and commune together (shoot the sh*t). It is replete with folks who have lived nearby for generations, and frequent this small institution regularly.  Yes. Everyone knows your name. \n\nWith this in mind, I stopped in for breakfast and took in the deep rooted atmosphere of this iconic establishment. I sat on a spinner along the counter, after checking out the tables on the opposite wall. A solo diner, I did not want to take up that much space, and after all, this was what a stool was for. Within seconds, I was called, \"Babe,\" by one of the servers working the counter and floor, and, \"Sweetie,\" by another, as she asked if I wanted coffee.  \n\nShe replied when I asked if she was talking to me - \"Whatever works, right, Babe?\" \n\"That's cool. I just didn't want the other guys at the counter to get jealous.\"  \nWith that, one of those old dudes looked over at me with a stern gaze, and retorted, \"She WAS talking to me, but, I don't mind if you thought it was you.\" \n\nWink\n\n I knew I was in the heart of Philly. \n\nThe menu was all about breakfast and lunch (they close around 2).  I went with the french toast, a side of corned beef hash and java. It arrived about 10 minutes later on an oval plate, with the hash on a second dish. I moved things around to get everything onto one before doctoring with butter and syrup.  \n\nThe meal was filling and satisfying. Six slices well egged and grilled. No real caramelization, but very tasty nonetheless. The hash was excellent. Deep savory flavor, a little crunchy. A great match for the sweeter fry bread.  The Bunn-O-Matic brewed a strong industrial joe which was replenished as often as requested. A small glass of real milk per my wish to avoid the heavier half & half. \n\nTate's is another of those classic kitchens from a bygone era that have survived and even flourished.  It is as authentic today as it was in the last century.  It feels dated, but that is one of the two main reasons to come to a joint like this - For the wholesome hearty grub and to experience a living cultural museum.",

I saw it plated and brought to me by the short order dude, with small cup of butter, and counter rocket of syrup.  \n\nWhen spread, melted and squirted, my breakfast looked great, and was caramelized on its edges, just the way I like.

The 534 bed facility at 8th & Pine, had the first surgical amphitheater in North America on the top floor of the Federalist style building; operating between 11 and 2 on sunny days, as when constructed there was still no electricity, and thus no lights bright enough for surgery. \nThe concept was that treatment was to be free of charge for all who sought medical care. Funding was accomplished by \"matching grants\" offered by the well to do members of Philadelphia society. First the land was donated, and then management volunteered their services. Collections were taken up to pay for the building of the structures. Franklin, Thomas Bond and the Stretch family, as leading citizens, were also the providers of most of the initial capital to get the project started. Ben's first contribution? 25 English pounds. Women were among the first students. \nThese days, it is nationally ranked in Adult Specialties of gynecology and orthopaedics, and also highly recognized for other specialties, including urology (the reason I was there). Its affiliation with the University of Pennsylvania Health System in 1997, added to its longevity and significance in the region. \nThe quality of care I received while there for day surgery was excellent. Everyone knew their roles, and clearly kept the patient's needs paramount. Every step was clearly explained, and I had conversations with everyone from the preparation team, to the anesthesiologist, nurses and my surgeon. There was plenty of attention in post op as well. I felt well cared for. \n\nI was pleased with the decision to come to Pennsylvania Hospital for this procedure. Somehow, the 270 years in existence gave assurance that I was in very good hands.",

Without a critical mass of Central Americans nor Mexicans in the area, the kitchen knows they are cooking primarily for gringos, and not their countrymen.

Delicious, with lettuce, onion and white cheese drizzled on top. The guava was cool and refreshing. Reminds me of apple juice, but more sweetness, and a hint of sour behind the bright sugar rush. \n\nService was friendly and personable.

The casa recently opened and is totally renovated from the former occupant.  It is new from top to bottom.  The space is light and airy with a north facing wall of windows onto Dayton Street, and comfortable furniture and excellent service.  \n\nI stopped in for breakfast after court today to check it out.  I was given a paper menu and invited to sit anywhere.  I took a table toward the rear where I could see everything that was going on.  I went with strong Columbian coffee, and the La Cabana Omelet, which arrived stuffed with chorizo, peppers, cheese, onion, potato and topped with fresh pico de gallo.  There was also a basket of fresh sesame seeded bread and butter provided.  \n\nThe meal was excellent.  Loved the egg dish.  It was steaming hot and melded together into a delectable hot mess.  Definitely a three egger. A few dashes of Tobasco and I was in business. The side of home fries were tender and nicely spiced, and really more than I could finish.  Nicholas stopped by several times to inquire as to my need for more coffee, and promptly took away the finished plates, while inviting me to remain as long as I wished.  Nice touch, as I was in no rush to leave this mellow, sunny place.  \n\nI was lucky enough to meet the new owner, who was in a business meeting at a nearby table.  As I prepared to leave, the gentleman with whom she spoke approached me to ask about my impressions of the operation.  He was there to develop a marketing plan for them.  I gave him my honest appraisal, and had a short chat with his lovely client. Clearly, she is serious about the success of this enterprise.  If she maintains this level of quality and professionalism, it is all but assured. \n\nPS. Just a hint - Consider turning down the volume on the TV if no one appears to be watching it. Better soft music than talk shows, even in Spanish.",

    "text": "If you love simple and delicious Polish food, Pierogi Factory is singing your song.  \n\nThis tiny four table restaurant is in the Shops at Red Lion on Bustleton Avenue, Northeast Philly.  The menu focuses on the staples: Pierogies, Stuffed Cabbage, Potato Pancakes, Kielbasa and a few other goodies.  Service is casual and sincere.  \n\nWe ordered their Combo Dinners in order to sample as many of their dishes as possible.  Combo # 1 had two potato pancakes, 3 pierogis of choice (traditional potato and farmer's cheese), and 1 Golabki (stuffed cabbage), with a little container of sour cream ($9.95).  Every element was excellently prepared with taste as good as my grandmother used to make.  The other combo swapped out the potato pancakes for a nice length of smoked (grilled) kielbasa ($10.95).  Also, fantastic.  \n\nI was full, but not stuffed, when we finished eating.  We shared a piece of apple cake ($3.00).  It was not as good as granny's, as it lacked the moisture, density and large apple slices she used to fatten up her grandchildren.  \n\nStill, a very pleasant surprise on Bustleton. Will definitely visit here again.",

    "text": "If you know New York cheesecake, then you've already heard of Junior's.  Their restaurant in Times Square is a \"must eat\" destination when visiting the Big Apple.  Why?  Because since the passing of the dearly departed Ratner's in Manhattan, Junior's is left to carry the cheesecake torch.  It is super rich, creamy, sweet, and succulent.  It comes in a variety of flavors and sizes.  The wait for a table in any of their locations is legendary.  \n\nBut, now, there is no wait at all if you come to their factory and outlet store in Burlington, NJ.  You can walk around and see what they have available, and walk out with a stack of sweet heaven.  The prices start at only $2 for a 6 inch plain cake.  That is sinfully glorious, because money ceases to be an object in the decision to buy.  There is no splurge at that price.  \n\nNothing this good comes without a small reservation.  It is irrelevant to many, but the cakes in the outlet are slightly \"irregular.\"  Some are lopsided; others have settlement cracks; a few have uneven swirls of strawberry or raspberry mixed in.  All these are rejected by quality control for the New York sites, but as a result, you can have a full cake here for less than the price of a single slice in the City.  \n\nTrue. Self control becomes an issue when something this decadent is available in large quantities, variations, and at impossibly cheap prices.  The addicts were lined up outside the door waiting for it to open.  They all made a beeline to the free samples and stuffed face until all the small paper cups were gone.  While they were buzzing there, I found the Raspberry Swirl 8 incher I was looking for, and made for the cashier.  That baby went for $11, and will feed my family for more than a week on rations.\n\nThe anticipation of that first smooth creamy bite sends shivers up my spine. \n\nWho's the addict?",

The front of the room has a shiny copper roaster where all their Ethiopian, Kenyan and Costa Rican beans are prepared for brewing or sale. \n\nI sat down for a cup of their Ethiopian Sidamo, a muscular strong coffee that is great both straight up and with a little milk.  It is definitely a wake up call to the senses. The alternatives this day were a Kenya AA milder bean, or a Costa Rican decaf.  They can also be blended if desired. \n\nService was friendly and informative.  Josh, the owner's son, worked the new digital register for my credit card purchase and seemed proud to be part of this enterprise.  Michelle, poured the Joe into a glass cup with room for milk, and offered to bring it to the table for me. Not handicapped, I did that myself, but appreciated the gesture. First sip alerted my tongue that a strong brew was on the way. By the time I was ready to depart, the caffeine had reached the brain, and I felt the welcome surge of focus and energy that only the freshest darker roast can provide. \n\nExactly what I needed. \n\nPrices are reasonable for a custom roast/brew operation, at $2.25 for a regular cup; slightly more for extra volume. There were a few folks working at the tables while I was there, thus no shortage of seats for those who wanted to sit and sip at this time of day. \n\nRichboro Coffee joins other recently opened coffee houses in the area.  The coffee competes quite well with that from Newtown's Coffee Room and Yardley's Pretty Bird Caf\u00e9.  Each contributes in their own way to the upgrade of caffeine alternatives in the region, with Richboro seemingly with the best coffee, Newtown with the most comfort, and Yardley with the most variety on the menu. Fond of all of them.\n\nRefills are a buck.",

    "text": "I just had one of the best cheesesteaks of my life!\n\nSteve's Prince of Steaks has a shop on Route 1 in Langhorne, and although not far from my home, I had never been there, always preferring my local pizza shop for my grease fix.  Friday night, while I waited to pick up my son at a Magic tournament at OVM, I had some hunger and time to kill.  Steve's came to mind. \n\nI arrived about 30 minutes before closing.  There were only a few customers, and the staff was beginning to clean up.  I read the ordering directions a safe distance from the window, decided what I wanted and walked up to the young guy in the Steve T shirt and ballcap. The Cheesesteak wit Onions, Provolone and Roasted Peppers came out on the thin sheet of Steve paper.  When I attempted to pick it up with one hand I felt the heft of the sandwich and quickly put my other hand underneath to keep it from sliding off onto the floor. It was that heavy.  It was a work of art.  The peppers, onion and cheese glistened under the lights.  A small pool of oil began to collect once I placed it on the small stainless steel counter than runs around the shop. \n\nI went back to the fixin's bar to get some Banana Peppers to add more heat.  I sat down on the bar stool and looked at this creation.  I took a photo to commemorate the moment.  I really thought there was no way I could eat the whole thing. Then I took the first bite...\n\nHeaven. I'm in Heaven...Yes, the song danced in my head.  The roll was lightly crusted and extremely fresh.  Great taste in its own right.  The blending of the ingredients on chewing was an intense explosive release of flavors, textures, spice and heat.  I lost all control.  I couldn't hold back.  I had an orgasm in my mouth before the second bite.  The sweetness of the onions soothed the heat from the peppers, but did not overcome them.  The provolone provided a subtle undertone that played well with the roll and sliced beef.  My eyes rolled into the back of my head and when they returned, the sandwich was completely ingested.  \n\nThe only thing I can say is, when can I go back for another? \n\nSuggestions:\n1. Cash only. There is an ATM inside the shop, but why pay the extra charge?\n2. To keep cost down, go with the Cheesesteak with American or Wiz, as the other cheeses are extra. \n3. Try the pepper fixin's bar before ordering extra peppers at the window.  There are plenty of choices there, and it is another buck or so to have them cooked with the steak.  \n4. The fries are very good. If you care at all about your heart, try them straight, w/o the extra cheese.  It looks great all melted over the fries, but when it cools it is just a coagulated yellow mess.  That is how your heart sees it. \n5. Don't wait another day to have one.",

With the obnoxious fees and taxes it is closer to $10. \n\nThe facility is south of the airport, so finding Smart on Yelp and using 'directions' is helpful to getting there, especially after dark.

Ten minutes later, you're at the terminal of choice. \n\nIt took about 15 minutes for the shuttle to arrive for pickup at 1 am. Not much conversation, but all of us were operating at half speed. Still, reached my car, loaded it and drove out quickly. I had to show my initial down payment email receipt to receive the right credit, and was given a sleeve of candy sours (perhaps to help me stay awake on the drive home). \n\nI will be a 'Smart' parker at least until a better deal comes along.",

Whether studying or being contemplative, such atmosphere tends to bring to best out in us. So it is with Shot Tower Coffee.\n\nSitting on the southeast corner of S. 5th & Christian, the large plate glass windows filter the afternoon light into a mellow golden glow that quickly transforms the small room into a spiritual center whose ambiance is palpable. No wonder people come and hope to stay as long as possible; sometimes on their laptops, and often is simple chats or just meditating as they mindlessly stare out the windows to the street life on the other side of this gossamer screen. \n\nNot to mention that the bean life is also excellent, with friendly service folk who engage so well with customers. \n\nMy chai latte was a large glass mug of well designed and prepared tea and milk that had great mellow taste and aroma. Likewise, the vanilla latte was bright with subtle vanilla flavor, and only needed a short shake of brownulated sugar to climb to the proper sweetness.  A sucker for lemon bars, theirs was wonderfully tart with crunchy base.  Loved it! \n\nWhy is it called, \"Shot Tower?\"  Damned if I know, with its double meaning.  I'll leave that to the coffee historians.  All I know is that I'm glad to have finally stopped in and realized the pleasure of its charismatic grace.",

She was friendly, and easily answered my questions about this new caf\u00e9 in Newtown (there are shops in Princeton and Plainsboro, NJ, too). \n\nBreakfast offerings are limited, but I jumped at the bacon, egg and cheese (gruyere) on croissant sandwich.

I knew Mavis existed, but had no clue whether they were reputable or rip off like some other rubber joints that hold customers up in services performed. No need to worry. These guys were not only straight ahead honorable, but had very competitive prices and were open on Sunday. A phone call led to a discussion of available options, set the price and secured an appointment with the tires put aside for me. \n\nI arrived Sunday morning and was greeted professionally, yet personably. The manager went over the agreement, and had my car up on a lift within 10 minutes of arrival. I was allowed into the garage to oversee the removal and replacement of the four bad boys. They discovered something loose in the wheel, pointed it out to me, and repaired it easily without extra charge. They bagged two of the old tires for me in case I needed a spare in the future. \n\nI learned that Kelly Tire was part of Goodyear, and carried a solid 55,000 mile warranty for their all weather version. On an AWD wagon that was important for all the things we used it for. I was also told to return soon for a final check on how the tires and wheels were acclimating. Will take care of that tomorrow. \n\nI was impressed with how smooth the operation ran, as much as I was with the very reasonable price given without the need to hondle. Mavis was as good as my regular tire folks, if not a bit better with follow up. \n\nLiterally, one door closes early, and another opens to accept a happy new customer.",

At one time, Rossi's was considered to grill the best burgers in the city. When they moved out to Quakerbridge Road in Hamilton, there was a big void left behind.  \n\nThat emptiness has now been replaced with this well appointed  casa Guatemalteca. I stopped by for lunch recently and was impressed with the quality of the finished space.  The old square bar had been replaced with a wall unit with attractive wooden back bar.  There was new furniture in the barroom as well as the rear dining room.  New windows on the world were stenciled with the new name and its Mayan pyramid logo. Tikal is a famous historic site in northern Guatemala where the Mayan Civilization build a large city and temple complex before the arrival of Europeans, or even the Chinese before them.  \n\nThe menu is a bit of a fusion exercise, with a large national delicacies list, and a few Americano dishes like hamburgers and cheesesteaks with a definite Central American flair.  They also blend up excellent shakes and fresh fruit bedidas, using your choice of water or milk base.  I took a stool on a hightop in the barroom, and was served by bartender, Ana.  She had the right temperament for the job, and was friendly and prompt with menu, order taking and food delivery.  She was also patient as I worked my way through the menu looking for the right combination for lunch. She finally recommended the Tikal Wrap, with came with papas fritas.  I also ordered a mango smoothie as a washdown.  \n\nThe drink arrived in a tall frosted glass.  The mango mix with water was cool, semi-sweet, tasty and very refreshing.  The wrap was a monster, full of grilled chicken, lettuce, black beans, avocado, tomato and an interesting piquant sauce. I ate as much as I could, knowing that I would be skipping dinner that night.  It was excellent. The ample pile of fries was more than I could handle, but they tasted great with the spicy mayo that came in a bottle rocket on request. The app chips and homemade salsa were overkill, but I did dip a couple of the triangular chips, and thought the salsa nicely spiced. \n\nTikal is one of the higher end Guatemalan houses in the Trenton area, and definitely worth a visit for lunch or dinner.  Prices are very reasonable.  I am particularly curious about their burgers, given the gloried history of the joint.  As I am not a fan of the new Rossi's, it would be ironic and poetic justice if the new Latin take on this American classic was better than the \"new\" original.  \n\nSometimes the city is the secret sauce that make for magical dishes.",

Each is a marvel of contemporary cutting techniques that capture the inner light and project it directly to the brain, where it explodes with intense pure color.

There are many other stones there, each carefully selected for their intrinsic value.  If they don't love the stones they see, they don't buy them. It is simple. Only work with what your feel an emotional connection. \n\nI recently brought in a beautiful peach tourmaline and asked Vincent to design a ring around it.  We discussed my ideas, and he offered his with a few simple sketches.  \nI was excited by the opportunity to work with him.  He had a rough setting in his workshop that he brought up to show me.  He described how he could do something like that in any metal.  It would be one of a kind, and would be ample enough to house the stone without detracting from its inner light.  I had to use my imagination to see the finished product, but I liked what he was saying.  The suggested price range seemed reasonable, and I told him to go ahead.\n\nThe final result was a silver shaft four prong base gently gripping the tourmaline in its four fingered embrace with small diamonds at the end of each prong like a period at the end of a poetic verse. It was beautiful. \n\nGive yourself the chance to visit Diana Vincent and fall in love with their work.",

Service was spotless.  We had the side room to ourselves.  So, while Soho may be SRO by night, if you want the great food without all the hustle, hassle and wait, try earlier in the day. \n\nFrom the look of most reviews, everyone already knows how awesome the Korean Fried Chicken (KFC) wings are. Double fried, and heavily dipped and basted, they arrive plump, crisp, loaded with flavor and plenty of juicy meat.  At a buck a wing, you are paying more than in the standard Buffalo wing joints, but there is really no comparison to the quality of the experience.

It is not the most convenient place to transport to, except for the locals who discovered it years ago.  It is 30 minutes from mi casa in Bucks County, and likely even farther from Center City, Philly.  The travel adds to the excitement, so when it is finally seen on the near horizon, the heart quickens, and the saliva flows, in anticipation.  Walking in is entry to an alternate Korean universe.  Don't worry. Everyone is bilingual and very friendly.  The music is cool and hot (like the wings), but loud enough to interfere at times with conversation and appetite. \n\nDon't let that stop you.  The Wings are the Thing!",

It all looks fantastic, and the samples at the counter make certain you try enough to bring you back for more. \n\nThe one downside is the expense of self indulgence. The bonbons are $2.50 apiece, so a medium size box assortment hits $30 before you can take a breath. You really have to love someone (or yourself) to make that commitment. Well, I did and I do, so I won't be too disappointed in myself. \n\nYes, my friends were duly impressed. The little balls of intense flavor wrapped in excessive opulent cacao were all that. With a good red wine chaser it was a near orgasmic experience. I watched as they bit their first bonbon and began to chew. Their eyes rolled to the back of their heads and a involuntary gasp escaped their lips. \n\nNo doubt the best way to enjoy these delights from Naked Chocolate is to be naked yourself with someone you love. \n\nSoon.",

Admittedly, the aggressive nature of the cart ladies hawking their delicacies takes some getting used to. You have to be able to say \"no\" when you feel overwhelmed by the surrounding din. But, know that slowing down the onslaught is proper, and multiple opportunities will present themselves. Just take what you want in the moment and let the trolley women return when you are ready for more. \n\nThe most important thing at China Gourmet is that they know from dim sum. There are dozens of choices and most of them are good to great. Shrimp and pork shumai, shrimp hargow, beef rice rolls w vinegar, fried stuffed buns, various dumplings, fish filled chili peppers, egg tarts and many others are well prepared and served hot or cold as appropriate. My bowl of congee was also decent with plenty of ground pork and fresh cut scallion on top. There is plenty more, but you get the picture. \n\nWhat's even better is the availability of FREE PARKING right in front of the restaurant, and the large Asian supermarket and Vietnamese kitchen right next door. The money saved is like getting a 25% discount off your check! Hard to beat! \n\nNow that we've experienced the fun and convenience of a strong dim sum morning with grocery shopping for dessert, Chinatown has lost some of its cultural luster for us (not completely). \n\nGotta love it!",

First, I walked into Levittown Lanes, the near-historic bowling alley at the east end.  I didn't want to bowl, but in my mind, the bar and bowling were in the same space, making for a lot of potential fun.  But, the man at the shoe counter, perhaps not understanding what I was looking for, sent me outside and to the last door on the right.  What did I know? \n\nI went into this plain wooden door without much of a sign, and found myself in a tiny dining area full of restaurant supplies and no customers.  To the right was the small takeout area with high half wall protecting the cashier and pizza ovens.  Ok. I ordered a Chicken Cheesesteak and inquired where the BAR was.  I was again sent outside and advised to take a left and enter the next door I came to.  Would my sandwich find me?  Sure. No problem.  \n\nI followed directions, and finally entered the actual barroom.  It was of the dive bar genre.  Dim, smoky, rock & rolly, and full of fatigued workers who where here for a few brews on their way home after another tough day.  Def my kind of place.  I bellied up to see what the back bar looked like, and met Angela, the mistress of ceremonies and bartender fatale.  I explained the strange circumstance that brought me to her lair.  She laughed and said that I must really need a cold one.  The Pabst Blue Ribbon pint was $2 all night.  Solid unpretentious American suds, just like the Band Box.  \n\nIt went down so smooth and cool and tasted so comforting.  The guys around the bar accepted me as they saw the pint pour down my gullet without more than a swallow.  Thank you, Milwaukee.  They confirmed that I had found the best bar in Levittown - best food; best drinks; best prices. The Steak Sandy found me a few minutes later.  \n\nIt was large, with a cut transecting the midline.  The bread was nicely toasted and crisp.  It had a good yeasty flavor all by itself.  The shredded and grilled Chicken was mixed with Onion and Mushrooms, with American Cheese holding the innards together.  It was hot, steamy and delicious.  A squirt of Ketchup and I was in business.  Maybe it was the combination of Pabst, people and the deft touch of the kitchen hands, but that was the most enjoyable cheesesteak I had eaten in a long time (at least since my last visit to Steve's).  \n\nAngela and I exchanged a few bar stories before I left.  Seemed we might know some of the same people in the biz.  I drove away thinking that of all the cool and curious old taverns in this part of the world, Band Box might be the best of breed.  \n\nNext week. Same time. Same stool.",

What we take for granted now, was once only an abstract ideal, written in books, and discussed in taverns and around wood burning fires.  \n\nThe new Washington Crossing National Cemetery rests on hallowed ground. All who visit there, either out of respect for a loved one for whom this earth is their final resting place, or for those of us who honor our warriors and the history they have forged with their blood, it is impossible not to dwell on the road we have taken to arrive in this place.

But, even with waiting a long time past the original window promised by the scheduler, ultimately, it was the quality of the work that counted most in the service industry.  Lucas had arranged with me to have someone at the house to fix a broken toilet between 8 and 10.  There was no way to know in advance that a one hour job would become a four hour slog.  They were courteous enough to call me twice to alert me to the circumstances, and offer to reschedule for next week.  The thought of going through the long weekend down a flusher with guests in the house was an unpleasant image.  I opted to wait it out.  \n\nBrandon arrived with apologies and explanations, and a positive demeanor.  He got right to work diagnosing the problem and prescribing the cure.  He had the necessary parts, and even had to change one when the first did not satisfy him.  Soup to nuts, he was finished in just under an hour.  He had to replace all the parts inside the tank to make the system work properly.  \n\nPlumbers aren't cheap.  This job came in just under two bills.

The atmosphere is urban casual, with wood upholstered furniture, step up side dining room, and lots of local artwork for sale on the walls. The menu is fairly traditional American fare. Breakfast and lunch are the focus. \n\nDuring the week there is ample street parking, although it may be necessary to walk a block or two. There is a small storm room entry at the corner front door, but once inside the full effect of this turn of the twentieth century retail space takes effect. It could just as easily be 1930 and 2018. I love that kind of time warping. \n\nService is offered by friendly neighborhood women, who move efficiently through the shop loaded with coffee mugs, and large breakfast plates. The java was strong and refilled as needed. My request for milk rather than creamer was met with a small stainless pitcher of cow juice. My short stack french toast was well saturated with egg, vanilla and cinnamon mix and grilled up with a good caramelized surface. Tasted so good with melted butter and lots of syrup. \n\nThe combination of old city streets, repurposed space and quality food made for a strong morning impression. Could have hung out a while longer with another mugga joe, but an appointment back in the 21st century beckoned.

Its 990 feet was only ten feet shorter than the Queen Mary that was its main competition for bragging rights in the maritime world. \n\nThat rusting bucket at Pier 70 on the Delaware River in Philadelphia, was once the pride of our country, with people willingly paying a premium to book passage for the experience of a lifetime. One of its largest investors, the Department of Defense, saw it as a troop transport as it game planned World War III, although it was never used for that. \n\nSadly, where the Queen has found a successful retirement in the Port of Long Beach, California, as a major tourist attraction with hotel, restaurants, boutiques and bicycle rental out front, the SSUS has bottomed out in its latest home for two decades unable to find the right combination of capital and brilliance to attain metamorphosis as an attractive destination.\n\nSeveral developers have tried and failed to move the project forward. One was sallow enough to sell off all the fixtures and furnishings just to pay the dockage fees.

Although this Denny's was busy this Saturday morning, I was the only customer by myself, so when the cashier asked if I would mind sitting at the empty 5 stool lunch counter, I jumped at the chance. He took a few seconds clearing space for me, and nodded toward it directing me to take a seat. A mug of fresh bracing coffee was placed before me a minute later.\n\nI drove to this old school grubhouse for one thing - the need to satisfy an urge for Chicken Fried Steak. Where it came from I didn't know, as I hadn't had this dish very often in life, but I saw no point in denying myself even if I couldn't explain its etiology. \n\nWhile waiting for my meal to be prepared and served I struck up a conversation with that cashier. He was all Jersey, growing up down the road from this place. Still, he had been around, and knew quite a bit about hunting, fishing and outdoor life. Covid also came up, and he was an early adapter to the vaccines, so early that he was observed in hospital. Impressive and brave on all counts. It was a good exchange in several pieces during my stool time.\n\nYup. The CFS was just what the doctor ordered - crunchy on the outside, tender ground steak within, and a white gravy over top that added a slightly sweet and peppery flavor. Sides of Red Potato Mashed and Sauteed Green and Yellow Zucchini completed the ensemble. Each was very good separately, and terrific together. It was a simple meal, and perhaps not the healthiest, but it rang every note of my expectations, and left a contented smile on my face. \n\nDenny's is not a regular stop for me, but sure delivered for me this day. From good talk through al dente seasoned squash and brown gravy tinted mashed, it was better than imagined. \n\nHow often does that happen?",

Those of you familiar, already know that it is a high volume higher quality Italian hoagie gold mine that creates stuffed sandwiches loaded with Dietz & Watson meats and cheeses, and a few signature pieces. Those of us who haven't been there before yesterday now know that this place is a legendary Philly landmark (30 years in this location) that turns out among the best Sammies in the city. \n\nI stopped in after a heavy afternoon of food shopping next door, and ordered two \"small\" 12\" torpedos with Rare Roast Beef & Provolone and Roast Turkey & Swiss, both dressed with lettuce, tomato, mayo, oregano, hot & sweet peppers. Both To Go. \n\nWeighing in at about one pound each, we tore into the roast beef on the drive home. It was spectacular! The meat was fresh and tender, the provolone mildly tart and dry, that combined with all the accessories for a dynamic and delicious bite and chew. The best way to attack this zoftig big boy was with two hands and aggressive squeeze and stuff into the mouth, just like with a cheesesteak. We tag teamed it, my partner holding it in front of my face, while I grabbed with one hand and directed it into my mouth. It only worked at stoplights, but a couple of large bites did the trick. No fuss, no muss. Only a sesame seed from the roll jumping off the bread onto my lap before slipping to the floor. \n\nThe Turkey & Swiss was just as good. Top flight ingredients and delightful eye opening taste. Both were good for two meals apiece, so we finished them later that evening with good brew and jalape\u00f1o chips. \n\nMarinucci's is one of those Philly joints that leave a lasting impression and a strong desire to return whenever in the neighborhood, which fortunately is about once a month. \n\nThe corner of Brous and St. Vincent is a true destination for everyone seeking variety in their low budget culinary exploits. Vietnamese, Chinese, Boba and Marinucci's all in one square of Mayfair is a foodie's dream come true.",

With Bonanza playing on the TV, Rick introduced me to his shop and menu; recommending one of his newer items, the Grilled Cheese Dawg.

To make it easier, Rick gave me a $5 off coupon for ordering my next meal online in advance of arrival, and made a last recommendation of his new Bacon Buttercup.  What's that?  Close your eyes...Imagine the best homemade Peanut Butter Cup - way better than Reece's...then add bacon.  Peanut Butter, Chocolate and Bacon.  \n\nStop drooling!\n\nIf that alone does not get you into your car and driving toward Bustleton, then go for the Dawgs and Grilled Cheese.

It went perfectly with my Fire Burger (medium), which had a few grilled Longhot Peppers and Aoili Mayo on top of the juicy and tasty ground beef to give the entire sandwich a spicy lift.  \n\nThis was one of the better burgers I had eaten in the past six months, and after having tried the Rossi Burger just the week before I was surprised how much better this one was - and at a lower price.  The Fries were ample and decent.  \n\nJester's Caf\u00e9 is the best place I have lunched at in Bordentown so far on my rediscovery tour of this historic river town.  While I have enjoyed all my meals there, this one combines ambiance, personality and taste in ways that most please me.  \n\nIt took me by surprise.  I became its happy captive, and will return.",

    "text": "A+ for this authentic \"Hole In The Wall\" Mexican caf\u00e9, The Tropical Rooster.  \n\nRight off South Broad Street at the corner of Park Avenue, El Gallo is a clean shop with about a dozen tables.  Sombreros line the walls, and Mexican soap operas play non-stop on the TV hanging from the ceiling.  The family owners are very friendly and bilingual, although I was the only Gringo having lunch.  I practiced my rusty Spanish, and received a few extra smiles for the effort.  \n\nThe menu offers a broad range of lunch and dinner options, and the kitchen is sufficiently visible to be able to see and hear the meals being made complete with the banter and laughter of the gifted husband and wife team.  \n\nThe Torta Al Pastor is a fat sandwich full of Grilled Pork, Onion, Pineapple, Cheese, Lettuce and a touch of Mayo, all stuffed into a oversized round roll.  It tasted great!  The Pork was lean with a touch of BBQ flavor, and the Pineapple added a distinct juicy undertone that really set off my taste buds. The mild Cheese hid beneath the two stars of the show, but provided a subtle ending to each bite.  This was large enough to be my dinner. I was not hungry again until morning. \n\nJarritos Mandarin, a favorite carbonated beverage, accompanied the feast, and a side of well tanned Fries completed the ensemble.  Apparently, they also concoct some tropical smoothies. I noticed them too late, but next time I will unlock that secret. \n\nEl Gallo Tropical is now on my short list for lunch, and will be a regular stop as one my favorite lunch spots now that I am working in the area.",

Plenty of cheese wheels, dried sausage, breads, sweets and takeout meals for the asking; all in a small shop that smells as great as it looks. \n\nI was there to grab a sandwich for lunch. They have a long list of choices that can be wrapped, rolled or sliced-breaded. I went with their turkey BLT on a 12\" crusty roll. It was huge. Stuffed with enough ingredients for two meals and smeared with aoili mayo that pulled the various tastes and textures together. The roll was excellent, with hard crusty exterior and well aerated sourdough flavor within. Definitely, best of breed master baker. Chomp and chew required strong jaw and teeth, and boy was it a worthwhile challenge. \n\nIt was a great sandwich experience. \n\nAte half, and rewrapped the remainder for later consumption (son devoured it as soon as I got home). $10 for two meals makes the price very reasonable. \n\nIn a land full of mediocre pizza shops, it is so nice to have another vision of Italian cuisine so well represented.",

    "text": "Caf\u00e9 Diem on South 8th Street, just north of Washington, may as well be located in Hue, the former royal capital of Vietnam.  Its version of Bun Bo would certainly satisfy the tastebuds of the Emperor and his retinue.  \n\nI admit to limited exposure to this Rice Vermicelli Beef Noodle Soup, but now that I have had it a couple of times, how will I ever go back to regular noodle soup?  It is so vastly superior to American slurp, that it is something of a cultural misnomer to label it \"soup\" at all.  It is much, much better.  \n\nThe Caf\u00e9 is a small 8 table house that closes at 7 pm daily.  My first attempt to enter was time barred because I arrived too late.  This time I planned around closing, and arrived at 6:30 to an almost empty room.  As I was solo, the hostess pointed to a deuce in the corner, which was perfect for a full view of the proceedings.  I ordered the small bowl of BBH and a Salty Lemonade to offset the 102F broil on the street.  That was gone in a flash.  The soup arrived two minutes later, so overfull with Thin Sliced Beef, Rice Noodles, Cilantro, Mint and a chunk of Oxtail, that it was difficult to add the fresh Thai Basil, Coriander, Sprouts and Squeeze of Lime.  I snapped off the smaller leaves, a handful of sprouts, and a full lime wedge, and managed to push everything into the hot broth with spoon and chopsticks. I think there was even a Banana Blossom on the plate that I tossed in.  With the room created on the side plate, I extruded copious amounts of Hoisin and Sriracha for dipping the beef.  \n\nThe final product was about the best \"soup\" I had ever eaten.  Its Lemongrass base was dominant and strident.  The undertone of Fermented Shrimp Sauce added a sour note to the spiciness that really played well together.  Although I asked for \"mild,\" that only applied to how much Hot Chili Oil they put in at the end, because the other condiments were already in the pot.  Finally, as I slowed down and reached the bottom of the bowl, the hint of sweetness came through.  Definitely a spoonful of sugar to make this medicine go down.  \n\nThis was a great liquid celebration.  It cleared my sinuses and had me envisioning exotic nights in Hoi An and Da Nang. \n\nI love Pho, but a well crafted Bun Bo is superior to that due to the many more ingredients, and the interplay of the four spice groups.  It is easy to see why this was the sup of the royals.",

    "text": "If you can't get to DiBruno's in South Philly, you should give La Stalla Italian Market a visit for your Italian delicatessen and specialty requirements.  While not packing the huge inventory of cheeses, smoked meats, salads, and bakery goods of its distant cousin to the south, the Newtown store sure is a reasonable facsimile.  This new place looks and smells like 9th Street, and goes overboard when asked to create a sandwich or other takeaway meal.  \n\nTheir loaves are about the best Italian bread you can find anywhere in the area.  Certainly as good as Italian Peoples' Bakery and the dearly departed Barbero's in Chambersburg, Trenton, NJ.  It is so excellent that it can easily be enjoyed without anything more, or a little olive oil with black pepper, or a smear of butter.  But, if an incredible lunch is what you desire, just pick a few of your favorite sandwich ingredients, the size roll your want, and let the deli folk go to work.  You will receive an immense tower of wonderful meats, cheeses and accessories that will last at least two meals. If you prefer not to create your own combo, just select one of their house sammies.  You won't be disappointed. \n\nNewtown has been undergoing a renaissance for the past several years, with improved restaurants and boutiques merchandising everything from designer clothing, great smoothies, to tasty tidbits. La Stalla Italian Market joins the fun and is built to scratch that impossible culinary itch. \n\nParking in the rear and on the street nearby.",

    "text": "This will be as much a testimonial as a review.  \n\nDriving out of Bordentown the other morning I heard my tire sensor start to beep.  Checking my maintenance screen I saw that one of my tires had a sudden and severe pressure drop.  Damn!  I had picked up a nail.  \n\nUnfamiliar with the auto shops and gas stations in the area, I was at a loss where to go to do the repair.  A minute later I was passing RW Tire on Rt. 206 northbound.  Serendipity? \n\nI made it into the crowded parking lot and went inside with my lug lock in hand.  The man behind the counter finished with a customer and turned to me.  I explained the situation.  No sweat.  They'd get to it in a few minutes.  He took down my particulars and I handed over my keys and lug lock.  \n\nAbout 15 minutes later I watched as one of their mechanics went out to find my wheels and drive it into the shop.  I walked over to watch him work and see what he found.  The guy was fast getting the car up, and even faster getting the offending tire off the car.  He rolled the tire looking closely for the cause of the flat.  He found it in a minute, got his nail extractor, yanked a cotter pin out of the tread and had the hole plugged, sealed and snipped in under 5 minutes.  This dude knew his tire repair!\n\nTwenty five minutes from pulling in, I was pulling out.  Impressive!  And, the cost for this service was under $20.  \n\nI complimented the tire jockey for his excellent work, and after paying the bill, asked the cashier what other work they did.  \n\nThey were so unexpectedly good at fixing my flat tire, they had made me a loyal customer in mere minutes.  I was pleased as punch!",

    "text": "Lakernick Health & Wellness is a chiropractic office that also offers massage and other related services in a compact facility in Feasterville, PA. It can be found on East Mrytle Avenue, a side street off Brownsville Road. A converted private residence it has a small parking lot in front, large enough for four cars. \n\nWalking in, the first impression is that the office is well worn with small treatment rooms to both sides down a central carpeted hall. Front desk staff is friendly and efficient, asking first time patients to fill out a two page questionnaire before seeing the doctor or masseuse. Prices are very reasonable. \n\nI was there primarily for a deep tissue/sports massage from Marla Solarski, who sees customers at several places around lower Bucks County. I was also curious about Stuart Lakernick, the owner of the business and bone cracker in residence. I had used a few chiros in the past and wanted to see how he worked on my back and neck. Stu is a very communicative guy, who nicely explains what he sees in examination (diagnosis), as well as what he intends to do for treatment. His equipment is excellent, with an adjustment table that allows you to stand up on the vertical inclined padded board, before it is slowly lowered into horizontal position via motorized swivel.  A first time for me. \nHis adjustment of my lumbar/sciatic spine was a traditional heavy torque as I lay on my side with legs bent and overlapping my knee, as he both pushed on my upper hip/pelvis and pulled on my upper torso with his body weight. My left hip was \"frozen,\" so that required a double move to get it done. But, done they were, and when finished, both back and neck felt looser and mobilized. \nThereafter, Marla's massage was great with her excellent stretching and probing style. I could see that doing both an adjustment and massage enhanced the effect of each on my body. They were symbiotic. I always felt wonderful, if a little lightheaded, after her handiwork, but this time it was more intense and the after effects lasted longer than usual. I took a short walk once outside to feel more grounded before driving home. \n\nSuggestion - The purpose of chiropractic and massage is to lessen a stressed body and mind. I was a little put off seeing a political sign in front of the office, and it actually resulted in a shift in attitude going in. Regardless of affiliation, I prefer a health and wellness center to be apolitical, as I get enough of that everywhere else, all day long. I want to be able to relax in a sanctuary setting, not be reminded of harsh realities.  It is counterproductive to the goal I seek. Maybe others feel similarly.",

He inquired about other possible health issues that his products could address, and made intelligent suggestions.  Much appreciated.  \n\nI am not vegan, nor gluten averse, so I did not spend any time looking in their deli cases, fresh produce, nor bakery sections.  Still, good to know they cover those concerns.  \n\nVery glad they carry top quality merchandise, are knowledgeable and take time with their customers to listen and inform.  \n\nThis is how Big Bear separates itself from most of the competition.",

    "text": "Past time for an updated review to reflect all the positive changes that this bagel emporium has gone through over the last few years. \n\nBiggest visible change was the expansion of their footprint and reorientation of the shop to permit side of building access which greatly enhances the size and feel of the space. Now Keystone is a for real cafe, with table and wall seating all around which gives a spaciousness to the operation.\n\nMost important, they have built a bagel bakery right into the shop, with windows allowing customers to see the bagelmeisters at work. Not having to transport them from a more distant location means that the bagels are apex quality right from the oven to the bins. Nothing is lost in taste nor texture when the overall distance is about 20 feet. The difference in chewability is immediately apparent. Crisp firm outer skin and soft tender inner bagel, and full load of toppings (onion flakes for me), that stay affixed to the rounder, and don't fall off with normal handling. \n\nService was excellent all around, with ordering at the counter and delivery to the table when done. Take out seemed just as smooth as I watched people come and go quickly. \n\nKeystone is planning an expansion into other shops and considering franchising the business. From what I saw and experienced on my last visit, they have a thoughtful plan and the means to execute. They listen to customers and are flexible enough to adapt to changing conditions. Personally, I would love to see them open up a little farther north in Bucks, and look into cross marketing with local coffee roasters where the best local Java and rounders were available in the same places and advertised together. \n\nThe current situation is impressive, I suspect it will only get better from here! \n\nMy candidate for Bucks Bagels of the Year!",

Even with the diaphanous shades drawn to reduce the glare, the room was bright, white, and clearstory cheery. The dining area walls were all glass, letting in the beautiful bucolic 360 degree panoramas. I was warmly greeted and had hot strong Ellis Coffee on my table when I return from the WC.  \n\nThe menu had creative breakfasts on one side, and lunches on the other.  They change their signature quiche and frittata daily as described by my lovely server.  In addition, they offer pancakes, french toast, omelets and Caleb's Breakfast Sandwiches; with each coming in tempting varieties, like French Toast Bananas Foster, and seasonal specialties. I could have gone in any direction with all the sweet temptation, but chose their take on a sandwich made of chicken sage sausage, cheddar and two fried eggs on a soft fresh brioche roll.  It came with home fried potatoes on the side. \n\nEverything was great!\n\nThe sandwich arrived leaking melted cheddar onto the plate that ran into the taters. It was overloaded, and could not be contained in my hands. With each bite one of the split sausage links fell out and had to be replaced.  Ultimately, I gave up on that and used knife and fork to handle what the challenged roll could not.  No problem.  It allowed each element to be savored separately and in combination.  Although the brioche could have been stronger, I have no complaints when the result is a veritable cornucopia of delicious pieces falling to the plate and being forked up in harmony with the home fries.  Those chunky tubers were excellent, too.  Just enough big pieces to hold the spices tossed onto them on the grill, and small enough for well done nibs to provide a tasty crunch. They were super fine, deserving recognition via their own photo. Let's not forget the Ellis brew that was free flowing and a strong wake up/washdown for this superlative breaking of the fast. \n\nCan't speak for the other meals, but Caleb's does a might fine midweek morning repast.  Maybe a few bucks more cher than non-Lahaska cafes, but so very worth the experience.",

She made me feel appreciated for giving them my business. \n\nWhen I returned home, I found nice sized portions of everything, including bags/containers of chips & salsa, red rice, silky refried beans and crema fresca. The three Flautas were six inches long and overstuffed with chunky semi- ground roast chicken and white cheese wrapped in a large wheat tortilla and fried to a pleasant crisp. I topped that with their gaucamole, lettuce and tomato. A final drizzle of queso fresca over everything, and I was a contented man. \n\nMy beautiful opposite number went after the Al Pastor with the same gusto, and described succulent roast pork surrounded by pieces of grilled pineapple, lettuce, tomato, guac and cheese; crammed into 3 smaller tortillas she could barely pinch and roll closed to get into her boca pequena bonita. She was hungry and didn't give me a chance to take photos before she demolished them. They sure had great aroma. \n\nEven the rice and beans were exceptional and worthy of mention. The grains were freshly made and not clumpy nor tasting of reheating, and the refried mashed kidney beans surprisingly smooth and delicious. All without the heartburn normally associated with heavy application of lard. No Tums necessary. \n\nDon Chile isn't in or near my neighborhood, but certainly is worth a drive in the country when the Mexican mood strikes. \n\nMucho gusto!",

    "text": "This 230 acre park was given to the people of Montgomery County by the estate of George Horace Lorimer, the editor of the Saturday Evening Post and president of Curtis Publishing Co., both headquartered in Philadelphia from the late 19th Century to the present. His mausoleum is in Laurel Hill Cemetery, so although originally from North Carolina, his true impact was on the cultural life of our city. \n\nFairly small, it feels considerably larger due to its connection to Pennypack Park covering a large area in Northeast Philadelphia to the border with Montco. The creek by the same name flows through both parks, tying them together geologically. The watercourse meanders through Lorimer where it has cut a deep ravine over the millennia. There are multiple scenic overlooks worth exploring, even in winter when the absence of foliage allows you to see through the trees to the actual contours of the steep rocky hills across the creek. \n\nIf power walking or family bike riding is your jam, Pennypack Trail runs along the northern boundary of the park and beyond for several miles, and it is flat, wide and dirt/gravel packed for smooth ambulation or cross country biking, allowing excellent views of the topography and creek vale. \n\nPlenty of parking in a big lot across the road from the main entrance.",

There are so many Mexican or Guatemalan restos in the area now, that it took me 12 months to return with trying a new place several times a month. \n\nThe space is basically as before, although the tables have been moved around and the sombreros have been taken down.  South of the Border music playing a touch too loud, and the Mexican soaps on the HDTV muted, leaving a lot of facial expression without voices. \n\nMy Torta Carnitas (Grilled Pork Sandwich) was stuffed with shredded pork, lettuce, tomato, queso fresca and mayo.  The Roll was for this \"small\" sandy was larger than a typical Kaiser, with smooth skin and soft, fresh textured body.  It held together well, although it required considerable squeezing to compress it sufficiently to fit in mi boca grande. \nI also saw a fruit drink at another table that looked very tempting.  I inquired about it and discovered that they make fresh fruit smoothies and shakes for a few bucks.  I got the strawberry shake and it was cool smooth sweet berry addicting succulence. \n\nI skipped dinner tonight because this meal was so satisfying. \n\nSo good to be back.  Turns out the first place visited when I arrived in Hamilton was perhaps the best.",

But, let's get back to their house goodies for a second. I was tempted by their lemon tart in the display case. I love lemon bars, so I figured, why not? It was awesome! Creamy tart/sweet lemon filling, thin, flakey crust, plump, cool blueberries sitting on top. An orgy in my mouth. \n\nThere are a lot of good bakeries and coffee houses these days; not as many in combination. Be Well is certainly one of the best of the genre in the region. \n\nAll this in a beautiful part of Montgomery County, just down the road from Bryn Athyn Cathedral and Historic District.

Plenty of parking alongside the stand alone building, with a long ramp up to the main door, you walk into a small deli/cashier area. There you can scan some of the home cooked meals offered by Proprietress Tina and her crew, as well as a sampling of her tasty baked goods. \n\nThe dining room is to the left, and bathed in bright sunlight on this Saturday morn. Only one table was occupied by a grandfather/granddaughter team, so I gamboled to the other side near the bar for my seat. Orders are taken at the register, so I returned there after perusing the two sided laminate menu. \n\nLots of healthy choices, and I selected the Hungry Person Breakfast Sandwich (3 eggs, 3 small homemade sausages, American cheese, tomato, greens on toasted thick sliced brioche). It was so large upon delivery to me that I asked that it be cut in half so I would have a chance to pick it up and take a bite without it falling apart in my hands. \n\nWell, it sort of fell to pieces under pressure from the kitchen knife anyway, but it still looked great when it came back to me. It still wasn't possible to secure it by hand with all the slippery ingredients, so I went after it with knife and fork. I combined different elements on the tines of my fork and jammed each into my mouth, my jaws as wide open as possible. \n\nIt was totally worth the effort.\n\nThe parts were as good as the whole. \n\nI took home a square of Tina's Key Lime Strawberry bar for later enjoyment. Just devoured that four hours later. Loved it! From moist graham cracker crust through tart creamy lime/cheese body, and hint of sweet strawberry, it was a pleasure all the way down.

    "text": "This official arboretum of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and an extension of the University, began as the summer residence of John and Lydia Morris, the children of I. P. Morris, a wealthy Quaker who made his riches in the iron business. It was originally called Compton, a mansion built on the promontory of the 92 areas above Wissahiken Creek. \n\nThe soil was poor when they arrived, but over the years, they improved it until it supported the beautiful landscaping and exemplar botanicals found today. Sadly, the mansion was torn down about 100 years ago upon the death of Lydia, and it was bequeathed to the University in 1932. It is now an integral part of its sustainability efforts for the 21st Century. \n\nThere are 12,000 labeled specimens in the preserve, as well as a Fernery (currently closed due to Covid), Rose Garden, and Horticultural Center within the expanded 167 acres. The walkabout for healthy outdoor folks is about 2 hours, although it can take considerably longer with a slow pace and lots of bench sitting to enjoy the surroundings. The Visitor's Center is closed temporarily, but restrooms are well maintained beneath the building. \n\nThere are courses available throughout the year for all ages and skill levels. It is also a great place for a wedding or other occasion. \n\nWear decent walking shoes as there are several miles of trails and significant elevation change from the top near the parking lot, down to the creek and back again. Water for a hot summer day and a hat are also recommended.",

    "text": "Pho Le Lai is a Vietnamese restaurant located on St. Vincent Street in the Mayfair neighborhood of Northeast Philadelphia. It is found in the same building as 1st Asian Supermarket, making it convenient to eat and shop for our Southeast Asian grocery needs. Both are closer to our Bucks County home, saving time compared to either Chinatown (traffic & parking) or Washington Avenue (traffic). \n\nI was the sole customer when I walked in around 3 P.M. The cordial manager got up from reading the newspaper and seated me at the table next to her and handed me their multi page menu. Another friendly woman came out of the kitchen with a pitcher of cold water, to answer questions and take my order. That was simple - Pho Tai and Roast Pork Banh Mi (This is a pho house, after all.) \n\nTen minutes later she was back with the \"Small\" bowl of steaming beef noodle soup requested, and a side plate of exceptionally fresh standard accoutrement (sprouts, sliced jalapeno, Thai basil sprigs and lime wedge). I took a pair of new wood chopsticks and flat bottomed spoon from the table holder and doctored the pho to my taste, paying attention to pull apart the nest of noodles lying beneath the surface of the dark broth (Northern Vietnamese style). \n\nThe flavor profile displayed some depth and had been simmering in a large pot for a long time. It wasn't quite as rich as Pho 75 or Pho Ha, but it was very good and didn't require help from the Sriracha bottle rocket on the table. It was plenty spicy with the addition of the jalapeno. \n\nI was content to slurp away and patiently lift noodles out of the caldron and fold them onto the spoon before shoveling them into my mouth. \n\nThe Banh Mi arrived minutes later. It was a full sized sandwich on decent French baguette, cut in half. Like the pho, it was larger than anticipated, especially for $6!  It was loaded with dark roast pork, daikon radish, carrot, aioli and cilantro. I added a long squirt of Hoisin to bring up the savoriness of that combo, and took a bite. From crusty roll through crisp daikon and ultimately tender pork, it was delicious and captivating. It was a complete oral and tactile experience. One of the best sammys I've enjoyed since Ocean Grove, California, the capital of Vietnamese America. \n\nAlong with China Gourmet, the excellent dim sum emporium also in that building, the presence of Pho Le Lai make St. Vincent Street a strong destination for your Asian taste buds and culinary needs.",

I was there recently for lunch. \n\nIt was renovated beautifully with new furniture and large fabric wall hangings that remind of Indian rugs. I was the sole customer when I arrived about 1:45 p.m. I was led to a table along a wall by the man working the floor. He handed me a menu and brought me a glass of water when I declined the bottle of Pellegrino sitting there. He promptly removed it. The afternoon menu offered quite a bit from thali combo metal containers/trays, to individual dishes, all of which came with fresh tandoori baked naan and bowl of basmati rice. \n\nChicken Cashmere was my choice. It is a milk based curry dish, fairly mild, with almonds and raisins adding  a touch of sweetness. It was excellent. The four quartered naan was hot with oil sheen and the perfect scoop for carrying the extra sauce from bowl to mouth. It was thin and crisp, and baked expertly. The very long grain basmati was a great bed to lay the creamy chicken upon. \n\nYes. I really enjoyed my Indian lunch at Cross Culture. Gotta hope that they have a lot more business for dinner, because they certainly deserve to attract a wide audience given the quality of their kitchen.",

His Nudy's Cafes have been open and expanding in southeastern PA since 1979. Almost embarrassed to admit that yesterday was my first visit to any of them. I stopped in their Conshohocken Lafayette Street kitchen for a late breakfast. \n\nThey operate in a large high ceiling room with half wall divided spaces for tables, and booths against one outer wall, if that is your preference. The menu has most of the usual suspects, with particular attention to several varieties of french toast. That's where I was heading, and went with their traditional three slice offering, with maple syrup upgrade and fresh brewed coffee. \n\nIt was excellent. It arrived with plenty of caramelization for crisp edges, and a delicious mix of egg, sugar and vanilla extract that enhanced the flavor and texture, and a dusting of powdered sugar/cinnamon. A mini bottle of pure light amber maple syrup accompanied the large white ceramic plate. After spreading the melting butter, followed by the pouring of rich brown syrup, it was ready for sampling.\n\nIt was the best french toast I have had in a long time. \n\nService was also above expectations. Friendly, interactive and professional, with prompt coffee refills and timely bussing. \n\nToo bad Nudy's isn't in Bucks County yet, because all locations are worth exploring. Given the quality of their product, it shouldn't be long before they secure kitchens closer to home.",

In fact, if you love rock music, you could come just for the strings and call this place a museum or guitar gallery. \n\nThe owner, an Australian rocker who can no longer finger the frets, ended up in New Hope and has the entire collection for sale.

My latte was decent, but I am not a big fan of Rojo's as a bean outfitter.  Better choices are available locally.  Still, the drink was hot, strong, and warmed my hands on this cooler morn.  \n\nEverything here is made \"to go.\"  The prices are very reasonable given the address.  So, overall, there is no reason not to stop by to service your caffeinated needs. It is a bit north of the center of New Hope, but there is plenty of street parking and a lot around the corner and behind Main Street.  Given the alternatives are the green mermaid and Dunkin, The Four Crows should be your first choice for coffee and comfort.",

Java refills as needed. \n\nThis was a three ring, holy roller circus.

They bake their own muffins and coffee cakes, and even their milk and burgers pump and grind from nearby cows. Taste and texture are from the hands of neighbors. \n\nThey have a fair wage policy for all employees. That means everyone earns a reasonable living income ($14./hr now). This encourages long term commitment from workers and ownership, and shows great respect for people. As a result a 20 % tip is included in every check. Nothing more required unless you feel it warranted. Yes, this makes it difficult to express dissatisfaction with service or food quality through tipping, but on balance there is far more good from this approach, than negative. \n\nTheir Elixr Coffee is hot and strong. Cold brew is also available at a small premium. In exchange for their smallish cups, refills are attentively prompt. In truth, the tables are smallish, too, so saving space makes sense. \n\nThe room itself is tight, but brightly yellow. An odd angled ceiling helps with acoustics and gives a slight unreality to the space. Big windows overlook Fishtown, a corner of Philly undergoing a distinct renaissance. \n\nFinally, our breakfast ( I don't do brunch ) was excellent. The Breakfast Burger was a double patty, thick bacon and sunnyside up egg on brioche bun that was juicy and fun. The side of fries was crisp and plentiful. Their homemade hot sauce, a kick in the pants when poured on generously. We shared a square of their peach/basil coffee cake. Both ingredients were easily palatable, and to our delight, it was not overly sweet, but allowed to make it's own quiet statement.

As a newbie, I ordered the aptly named \"Lovebird Sandwich,\" which came with a perfectly deep fried battered breast, cole slaw, pickles, lettuce and special sauce mayo, on a freshly baked local bakery brioche roll. \n\nIt was one of those meals where the enjoyment began with the first bite through the thick layers of crisp crusty bird, through the tender sweet roll. It was as textural as it was flavorful. It was delicious and fun to eat. And, if you prefer roasted chicken over fried, go for it! They have that, too, and although I didn't taste it, it looked awesome.\n\nTasted a few fries, and they were quite good, but I'm trying to be good to myself by some modification of diet, so I passed on getting my own. The Lovebird was so great on its own that I really didn't miss them. Also, begged off the Boylan Soda, one of my past faves. \n\nNow for the News Extra! Lovebird is coming to Newtown soon, across Sycamore Street from its sibling, Jules. That is something to get excited about! Not just another knock off franchise, but a true original.",

Housed in a former bank from the Golden Age, the high ceiling and neo-classical architecture are a fitting backdrop for the high quality and superior platters conceived and executed in the kitchen woks. \n\nWe had a 15 minute wait for our table to be ready, but the time was well spent at the bar sipping an excellent Malbec and adjusting to the bustle of a busy Friday night. Really liked our table in the back under the dramatic staircase. More private and romantic.\n\n We ordered four dishes prepared in different styles, and moderately to seriously spiced. Cumin lamb, dry fry beef, dry pepper fish and string beans with minced pork, arrived seven minutes after our excellent server accepted our requests. The quickness surprised us. Yet, each dish was perfectly plated and at their peak flavor. None were overly oily, and each distinct in their texture and taste, despite the use of similar Szechuan red and black peppers. Everything was delicious, and we were glad for over-ordering so we had plenty to bring home. \n\nThe size of the room was unusual for an American Chinese restaurant, and reminded us of the large banquet showrooms popular in China. It added to the authenticity of the overall experience. \n\nI didn't remember Han D. being such a complete and satisfying night when across the street. Whatever it is, they have it going on now. In spades! \n\nFive Stars!",

    "text": "Makhani (\"Buttery\") is a small, dark, North Indian house on historic S. 3rd Street, Philadelphia, PA. Service is individually prepared, so you receive a large plate with your order and a side of Basmati rice, rather than the bowl approach used by most Indian shops. It is still easy to share with a companion, so it is really no big deal. \n\nWhat they do very well, is make sauces/gravies for their dishes that are better than most. Uber creamy (perhaps from all the butter from which it takes its name), such that regardless of the solid part of the meal, the succulent sauce completely overwhelms it. Our paneer and lamb bases were very good, but the Tikka Masala and Muglai suspensions in which they swam were simply stupendous. With a little heat from the curries, and a spoon, not a drop was wasted. The garlic naan made the perfect tool for dipping/scooping as much rich gravy as possible. \n\nThis was really one of the best Indian sups I had enjoyed for a while. Even the Samosa Chaat appetizer was distinct enough with its ground potato/chickpea samosa and smaller crunchies and excellent tamarind flavoring to make us slow down and enjoy every morsel. \n\nThe only disappointment was the supposedly extravagant mango cheesecake. When it arrived, it was far smaller than expected, both in terms of length, width, volume, as well as taste. It was underwhelming to say the least. Maybe our expectations were too New York, but this job was not worth the $10 by half. Makhani does itself no favor by accentuating it as a popular delicious treat. It is not. Save your money for the real deal at better known cheesecake outlets.",

Now, teamed with the Sellersville Theater next door, it offers a great destination in northern Bucks County to eat, drink, sleep and be entertained. \n\nWe drove up late Friday afternoon to buy tickets for the upcoming Indigenous rock/blues concert. It was a beautiful drive. Parking was right across the street, and the box office was open for business. This will be covered in more detail in a subsequent review. \n\nThe Washington House beckoned next door, so we walked down the street and entered through the bar. It was dim with long bar to the left and dining room to the right. We arrived at the right moment as there were several stools open. We grabbed two and we're immediately greeted by a tender who informed us that they were doing an Octoberfest Beer Tasting event, and we were just in time to join in. \n\nYes, we will. Thank you.\n\nWe chose Flight One, consisting of three 6 ounce pours of Paulaner Hefe Weissbier, Hardwood Park Pills and River Horse Cherry Berliner Weisse. They all came from freshly opened bottles. They were each distinct and very good. The Hefe was mildly bitter and peppery with a hint of clove and a surprising ripe banana-like end note. The Park Pils tasted of grass and grains and was cloudy like cider. The Cherry Berliner was sour and tart with a soft ruddy red tint. If we had more time we definitely would have saddled up for dinner and a second and third flight. Others had joined us at the bar and the dishes they were served were mighty appealing. \n\nOur impressions were so positive of Washington House that we decided we would come back for a full night of revelry with music, food, drink and room upstairs so as to extend the celebration to breakfast the next morning. \n\nIf only the theater next door had bruncheon concerts!",

    "text": "Those of us who remember and enjoyed the heyday of the Chambersburg section of Trenton, NJ, with Italian restaurants on practically every corner, felt a special sadness as one after another they began to close or move out of town to the suburbs. Over the last two decades as the neighborhood changed and the original families moved to greener lawns and better schools, they took most of their traditions and cultural institutions with them. When Amici's closed it's doors recently, the Italian era of this capital city was officially over. \n\nYet, there is another casa Siciliana still going strong after 30 years at the same location. It might not be in the \"Burg,\" but sure feels like it once you step inside. Enzo's sits almost invisibly on the northern end of Princeton Avenue in Lawrenceville, west of the Brunswick Circle. It is a small, cozy, darkly lit, romantic hideaway, where the Scozzari family has been running a pure Italian kitchen for two generations. I sure hope there is a third.\n\nPark in back and walk past the outdoor dining area, through the front door and then a second one on the right. Step down into the small dining room and be greeted by Anna, daughter of the namesake Enzo, who will seat you at one of only dozen or so tables, and hand you the menu. Moments later, the head waiter approaches with water and description of the available specials. There is a small lunch menu with soups, sandwiches, and pasta plates. \n\nThey didn't have the Italian Hot Dog I desired (being removed from the menu), but the suggested alternative, their \"World Famous Meatball Sandwich,\" sounded about right. \n\nAnd, it was. Excellently garlicked, crusty toasty Italian loaf, stuffed with hand-rolled meatballs,  sauteed broccoli rabe, spinach and roasted red peppers, with a side a sweet tater fries, all on a large white round plate. Delicious! I like to deconstruction a sandwich and eat its elements separately to savor each ingredient. I did that for half and had a mouthful of flavor with each bite. It was unforgettable. The second half I attacked\u200b en masse. Cleaving through it and enjoying the texture and taste of each bite as they melded in my mouth. No red gravy here. Just each part doing its job to make me happy. Quite a total experience for a lunch. \n\nGot to go back for a romantic dinner soon with the woman of my dreams and a couple bottles of Chianti.\n\nEnzo's is the real thing.",

These days you can detour to Bristol, PA, and stop in to Cindy's Caf\u00e9 on old Mill Street, and have breakfast or lunch within its sunny clime. The local family running the show loves both Bristol and Key West, and lives in both.

The walls are covered with their personal artifacts, from post cards to family photos to clothing worn to protect them from the Tropic of Cancer sun. Steve, Patty and Kelly are excited and proud of what they have created out of personal tragedy, and they all work with heart, soul and mind fully invested. \n\nMy sausage, egg and cheddar breakfast sandwich was one of the better renditions I have had the pleasure to devour.  There is a real chef in the kitchen who knows that runny fried eggs are much better than a hard finish, and the use of a fresh, quality roll or bun is the best way to contain the dynamic ingredients, and absorb the drippage for delectable texture and flavor. The side of home fries was a nice extra touch, although I am partial to skin-on red bliss potatoes for my morning fries. The java was hot and strong, too. \n\nMill Street is really coming on with many new restaurants and shops. What was once a main drag to avoid, has become a place of entertaining choices, with international cuisine and loads of local talent. Cindy's Caf\u00e9 also does its own Key Lime Pie @ $3.50 a slice.

Even we peons in Row O were just above the heads of the band and had perfect location for the sound and fury. Comfortable seats and room enough to stand and boogie when the proper riffs blew us out of our chairs. \n\nIndigenous was fantastic!

This Native American group from North Dakota has been rocking since the late 1990s. The members have changed, but the raw talent and energy has not. Mato is a complete original heavy guitarist. He sounds like a cross between Stevie Ray Vaughn, Jimi Hendrix and Carlos Santana with Warren Haynes thrown in. His own songs are very good, and when he segues into Voodoo Child, Little Wing and I'm a Man instrumental, he amplifies and projects a towering presence that just sends the house into orbit. \n\nAnd, when all is sung and done, and they have played their last encore, they come to the lobby for a meet & greet. No rush. Just hanging with their fans, signing autographs and selling their latest CD. Friendly, grateful and totally engaged. \n\nSellersville Theater is a gift from the rock and blues gods.

    "text": "You can tell that folks in the Newtown, Bucks County, PA, area were hungry for great pizza, because Vince's Pizzeria and Taproom was absolutely jammed at 4:30 on the weekday afternoon I stopped in to check it out. There was hardly an empty parking space to be found. \n\nAnd, I understand why. Our region has a load of pizza shops, but extremely few that really know the pizza business (read, none). The people behind Vince's have several generations invested in making superlative dough and sauce, and using quality cheeses to create exceptional pies. Only the sainted DeLorenzo's transplanted from Jersey compares. \n\nLuckily for me, there was room at one of the large community tables in the back of the house. Everyone was friendly and welcoming. We ended up in extended conversations as we chowed down. There was a couple from Yardley, and another from Trenton, NJ. We were all there to sample the wares, and drink from the fountain of beers along the rear wall. It worked fairly well, although it was obvious that they were still on their shakedown cruise, this being their first week in operation. \n\nThe taproom concept is still new and not readily available. It requires the purchase of a RFID chipped card that attaches above the tap to the beer selected, releasing the brew into 12 oz. glasses which are filled by the customer. The available inventory is pictured above each tap, with brief description to help you choose. The beer card is good for 32 oz., after which you must pay for a reinfusion of funds. It all gets a bit complicated, as it seemed that the staff was repeated asking for a credit card for that, and again at check out. I handed mine over three times - there should be a better system in place. \n\nYet, all is forgiven because the tomato pie/pizza is so damn good! The crust is thin, but stays firm from first munch to last. No drooping points here. The taste is like a first rate cracker, with a little saltiness that offsets the mild sweetness of the sauce above. There is just the right ratio of red to white, so there is no excess run off from cheese oils, nor watery tomatoes. From first steaming bite to last cool belly filler, the consistency is constant with crunchy crust and easily distinguishable ingredients. These are high quality pies. \n\nAll  I can say is that the other pizza joints in and around Newtown are in trouble now. The competition just jumped up a few notches. Once word gets out that Vince's is the new sheriff in town, the old boys will find themselves out of luck, and will have to improve their game if they want to stay in business. \n\nIt's about time!  Thank you, Vince's!",

Walking in, I was greeted warmly by a lovely woman, who exclaimed, \"Welcome Home.\" She immediately warmed my heart with her salutation. I sat in the back of the dining room, right in front of the glass partition with the kitchen. I was handed their small menu, followed quickly by a mugga joe. It was hot and brisk. I inquired about the French Toast Casserole. Learning that it was very sweet, and asked that it be less so. She said that could be done, and a few moments later, I had a three inch high stack of Texas Toast that had been well dipped in a egg/sugar/cinnamon/vanilla slurry and pan fried/assembled into one united structure. Strawberries and cream on top. \n\nYes. It was delicious from top to bottom, and even the accompanying sausage links played their second fiddle role well. I came in joneszing for sweet fried bread, and was completely satisfied. \n\nWelcome Home is Black Woman owned and operated by Stephanie, who is the guiding light and creative force. Her personality dominates the proceedings in a great way. The combination of character and kitchen magic makes this place a keeper and highly worthy of your exploration. Be sure to bring hungry taste buds.\n\nBut for living in Bucks County, I would make Welcome Home a true and regular stop on my breakfast trail. It is that unique and appealing.",

Upon entry I quickly realized that I had entered an unexpected time machine that would carry me back to childhood adventures with my parents and grandparents shopping the small ethnic stores in the Upper West Side of Manhattan, where Jewish and Italian delis, butchers, fish mongers and fruit stalls kept us fed and connected to our heritage. \n\nNonno's display cases were full of beautiful cakes and the like that required time to explore and difficult choices to be made among the incredible bounty of colorful, luxuriously tempting items. There is a health limit to the quantity of sugar anyone should consume, and this bakery would push that to the max. So, I let my camera do the tempting while I selected only a few things that were turning me on. A slice of carrot cake to cover the pastries, two donut twists to sample their coffee companions, and a marzipan banana to tease on the fruit bowl of choices created by the creative hand of their talented almond paste sculptors. Sure, it wasn't enough, but now I know where these artists are, and can return at will.\n\nThe carrot cake was not what I imagined would be a heavy cake base with uber sweet cream cheese icing; but instead a light gingery cake and a mildly sweet layer of butternut-like topping. It was excellent in this format. More subtle taste than the diner version. The donuts were a yeasty twist, still moist and chewy, with a delicious thin layer of icing that was a slow pleasure to eat. Better than anticipated. The marzipan banana (as were all the trayed fruit) was a softly firm almond paste that was best taken in small bites and masticated with attention to the release of that unique and seductive almond flavor that expanded as chewed. Ummm...\n\nIt wasn't a complete Roman heaven. I skipped the cookies covered with jimmies, and the cannoli prefilled with vanilla sweet ricotta (I'm not a jimmies guy, and prefer my cannoli filled when ordered). Nonetheless, Nonno's Bakery is a worthy destination to satisfy that part of your sweet tooth that can only be satisfied by high quality old world goodies.",

Give them three unusual objects, moments in history or dialogue from Neil Simon plays, and they return with an hilarious sketch called out if their interactive imagination. It was all great! \n\nAlthough the evening began as a fundraiser for local candidates a week before the election, it quickly became an exercise in team building and support for the final get out the vote push, while it also showed another side of all of us who were ready for some fun after so many month of all too serious campaigning. Didn't know how funny those guys were! \n\nSo, we raised some money, ate some good food provided by local restaurants and delis, and enjoyed an unexpectedly wonderful evening. \n\nThanks so much Unscripted Productions. \n\nCreative Improv = Creative Improve",

    "text": "Birthday Flowers in the Age of COVID-19 - \n\nSomethings in life must be celebrated on time regardless of surrounding risks. So it was that a bouquet of fresh cut flowers were required to honor my wife's birthday in the middle of a quarantine stay at home order. Roses didn't feel spontaneous enough, nor as crazy ebullient as the moment needed. No, the creative hand of a true florist and flora lover was the way to go. \n\nI used the third party online vendor I had worked with before, but to my good fortune they subbed out to Penny's in Glenside for execution. They were on time and on my wavelength. We left the package on the porch for a day out of an abundance of caution to allow any Covid cooties to be rendered inert. When we brought it inside to the kitchen, and unbound its wrapping, we beheld a riot of daisies, sunflowers, zinnias, red carnations, a few gorgeous coral roses and dried sinuatum. They were soft to touch and scented like the dawn of Spring. \n\nMost importantly, they generated the emotional response I was hoping for from the object of my affections. She kvelled like a purring kitten, and treated me like I was the celebrant, not her. \n\nJust as it should be. Penny's had it exactly right. I now have a new florist.",

    "text": "Aside from the high price found across the board at Trenton Farmers Market, the baby back ribs offered by Smoke Chef Jeff of Hambone Opera are terrific. Meaty, tender, pull off the bone and barky, this hole in the wall is considered the best Q in New Jersey by those who know. \n\nThe main man himself learned the wood science while in Texas and brought his experience and original notions with him when he came here. The sauce is Kansas City red tart, but the secret lies in the wild cherry wood logs with which the meats are smoked for 12-13 hours in the huge closed steel smoker out back of the market. \n\nThe wood is the thing in the hands of a well trained smoke chef, and Jeff has developed it to the height of culinary arts it was meant to be. You can taste it in the mild sweetness in the heart of each rib before it is overcome by the spicy Kansas City rub and sauce, and yet again by the more tangy squirt squeezed on as the final step before eating. \n\nThis was great BBQ. At $14/lb, it was not cheap, but what you would pay for eat in platters, not takeout. Nonetheless, sometimes the splurge is worthwhile. It certainly was this time. The brisket looked just as good, as did their smoked beans. \n\nNext time for those.",

But, today with a sudden opening in my schedule and finding myself already in Philly, I decided on a return stop to get my tootsies, neck, shoulders and back some quality attention. \n\nThe place hasn't changed much. Maybe some new neon out front and new hands on deck, but it looked and felt as remembered. I opted for the 90 minute combo foot and body Chinese style massage. Judy was cleaning up the shop when I arrived and immediately directed me to one of the large recliner chairs and foot rests while she went to fill the wooden bucket with very hot water and herbal bags. \n\nShe dug and squeezed for half an hour, putting me immediately to sleep.  Felt great waking up and walking on air to the massage table in one of the back rooms. She found the knots in my back and shoulders and applied strong pressure to make them relax and allow blood and Qi to flow freely. Nice release and relief. \n\nWhen she finished she cleaned the room and brought me a glass of cool water. She was friendly, but quiet as she worked. Very satisfying session. \n\nPro Tip - Although the sign says \"Cash Only,\" in fact they do accept some credit cards, but prefer their tips in cash. Makes sense to me and I was happy with that arrangement. \n\nIt was nice to be back @ V&V.",

But, plan to stop at Kalman's for a sweet treat on your way out of town. This family operation bakes up very good cookies, cakes and donuts at low budget prices to meet the needs of the community.

The traditional Old Fashioned donut looked like a blooming flower, while the Glazed was a pillow of sweetness and light. So good with the java washdown. \n\nNow that I know where it is hidden, I will be back to Kalman's as time and sweet tooth allow.",

    "text": "From the look of the dog eared, battered menus of the \"Legendary\" Dew Inn Diner @ the corner of 5th & Girard Avenue, Northern Liberties, they had been in use for the more than 50 years this awesome joint had been in business. The low 20th century prices didn't lead me to think differently. Sure, the furnishings were likewise dated, but it all came together to create the perfect environment for a traditional Philadelphia brekkie, sans all the hoopla of the nouveau brunch scene. \n\nFrom our perch on two spinners at the counter, we sipped the Bunn java and watched the full house deep in convos and good winter Saturday morning feast-ivities. When our Spanish Omelet and A Hot Mess 'kitchen sink' omelet arrived, we were very ready to chow down with gusto. \n\nAnd gusto was what we got. Each was a 3 egger, so full of ingredients that it was surprising that everything got tucked in. The ham, peppers, onions, cheese and salsa in the Spanish melded wonderfully and the taste/texture was great. The home fries were crisp, yet buttery, and all we needed were splashes of Crystal Hot Sauce to complete the excellent profile. The Hot Mess threw everything in the kitchen including the potatoes into the egg shell. How they zipped it up without leakage remained a secret. It was filling and delicious, and the rye toast added a touch of subtle sour savoriness that was good to the last bite. \n\nDew Inn is another awesome corner breakfast joint that the City of Brotherly Love is so rightly famous for. Loved every forkful.",

    "text": "As soon as we walked in to Greystone it was obvious the new owners put alot of money into renovating the old Lavender Hall. Although mostly black and grey, the front bar/ lounge was beautifully sedate, and the dining room spacious with room between tables and large windows bringing in late afternoon light before the coming of dusk. It was impressive, and on this Tuesday evening, not crowded at all, which enhanced the sense that we had chosen well. \n\nWe were seated at a table mid floor, but asked to be moved near an electric outlet in order to charge a cell phone. They graciously obliged. Our server quickly introduced himself and brought drink and food menus. The wine and beer lists were broad enough without necessitating a trip to the wine cellar. My old friend selected a glass of zinfandel, while my beautiful date picked a light small brewery pilsner, and I a pineapple cider (delicious). We settled in with the drinks and caught up while perusing the menu. \n\nWe kept dinner on the lighter side, with a Chopped Greek Salad, Mushroom Burger and Fig Jam Burger for yours truly. At $15 per slider, the price was high, but still much more in line with our appetites than the entrees which were double the cost. So, we felt that management was smart to offer smaller options that allowed for drinks and/apps and a reasonable bottom line. Besides, we thoroughly enjoyed our meals. The burgers were half pounders with brioche rolls and homemade potato chips or fries. The fig jam added a nice sweet dimension to my burger. My friend asked for grilled scallops added to the salad, but when the kitchen lacked them, they inquired if he would be satisfied with shrimp instead. He was. \n\nWe were happy with our experience at Greystone. It was qualitatively superior to the previous tenants who tried to make a go of it in the old mansion on the road between Newtown and Washington Crossing. The outdoor patio looked appealing, but with the steam heat unrelenting even into the evening, now was not the time to try it out. \n\nThis was an interlude even George himself would enjoy.",

    "text": "Sun Yu Si Kao is now my favorite Szechuan restaurant in Philadelphia Chinatown. Not only is the food superlative, but the house is beautifully designed with high ceilings, stone accented walls, unusual rope lighting and attractive serving dishes. It's great to see Ctown dress up and show its more sophisticated side in the hot, spicy and numbing world of Chengdu cuisine. \n\nWe ordered seven dishes for the two of us, with enough to take home for the rest of the family. Allow me to enumerate:\n\n* Sliced Beef & Tripe w Chili Sauce - Served cold but loaded with high temperature chilis, it was a great starting point. The textures of thin firm beef and loose tripe and the prickly feel of chili beginning the night of hotter and hotter choices;\n\n* Takoyaki - Try to imagine whipped squid shaped into large marble sized balls. Creamy, yet definitely crustacean; slightly sweet, but also mildly fishy and sticky on the teeth. Very unusual, but surprisingly tasty;\n\n* Spicy Shredded Beef - Tender mixed with pepper, onion, sprout,  Szechuan reds and a smattering of black  peppercorn and light film of chili oil, all of which continued to raise the Celsius in our mouths;\n\n* Cumin Lamb Chops - The star of the show. Eight baby chops grilled and covered in more hot peppers, with bone wrapped in foil for ease of handling. Absolutely delicious enough to allow us to ignore the growing conflagration in the quest to strip every morsel of lamb from the finger width bone. Simply amazing; \n\n* Pan Seared Green Shishito Pepper - Beautiful rich shiny green. An explosive pleasure to consume. These boys appeared to have an inner glow, and were as burning hot as they were gorgeous to behold. They may be an acquired taste, but thankfully I have acquired it;\n\n* Spicy Sliced Fish - White fish fillets is a large sculpted iron cauldron full of multiple peppers, including black peppercorns for numbing anesthetic effect on the tongue and gums, black fungus and sprouts in a deeply fired near molten liquid that both punished and delighted. \n\nSure, there is a degree of masochism to loving Szechuanese food, but once the burn subsides as it always does, the full capsaicin rush can be fully appreciated as a successful challenge to the senses that grows on you. \n\nOvercome and carry on.",

So, expectations rise and you prepare for more magic moments. \n\nI chose Tacos Cancun because I desired good Mexican cuisine in a safe space respecting Covid Protocol. Just so happened that the back patio had been recently renovated - replacing beach umbrellas with a large lime green tarpaulin over all the tables and a 6' bamboo screen all around. It made the backyard feel private and someplace more tropical than New Jersey. That I was the only paying customer late Sunday afternoon, certainly helped with the vibe. I took a table along the southern wall about halfway back and had all the attention I could ever want. \n\nThe menu had most of the usual suspects, plus a few house specialties. Although I was considering Flautas, Chili Rellenos, or Torta Milanese, when I arrived, I changed my mind for a walk on the wild side and ordered La Gringa, one of their specials that seemed to cover a lot of bases (sauteed veggies, ham, chorizo, melted cheese and crema drizzle). It was well reviewed, so I rolled with the optimistic sense I came in with. \n\nWithin 10 minutes a large white ceramic plate arrived, with Red Rice & Black Beans and hot Tortillas. It was all delicious, even though I didn't understand why the dish was called \"Gringa,\" (North American Girl). No doubt there was a story there, but the servers didn't seem to know it. Even without the additional local color, it was a fine filling meal. It wasn't overly spicy, but not everything has to be a conflagration for me to be happy. \n\nWhile not as intensely authentic as the kitchens found in the Hispanic neighborhoods of Trenton or Norristown, it was plenty good enough for me. No hesitation coming again.",

Capturing an image of pirate treasure and devious scalliwags as part of your business image has gotta be a strong beginning for this new enterprise on Oxford Valley Road in Fairless Hills, PA. \n\nThat they also turn out fantastic sandwiches, steaks and the like, means they can back up the talk (advertising) with action. My Italian Hot Dog was amazing. Three quality frankfurters in a sesame torpedo roll topped with a load of roast potato, Italian frying pepper, sauteed sweet onion, mustard and ketchup, and doctored with hot banana peppers from the fixings bar, makes for a memorable chomp down. It was the best I've enjoyed in many years. \n\nAt nearly $9 it wasn't cheap, but when you realize there is really enough there for two people or to take home half for later consumption, the value proposition comes into focus. Come with your favorite +1, or pack and carry for your later pleasure. \n\nJohnny Longhots is good for eat in or carry out, or both, as I just discovered. \n\nTotally impressive.

Living in central Bucks County for decades, someone should have alerted me to how good it was; and after joining Yelp I should have scouted it out myself long before. Mea Culpa! \n\nNow that the boys and I have have broken the ice, we are in accord that we just had one of the best Bucks sups we can remember.  We mixed and matched the Whole Chicken Wings with Reaper (extremely hot) Sauce, Red Buds, Half Rack of Baby Backs, and the Maple-Bacon BBQ Grilled Salmon. \n\nThe wings were about the biggest I'd ever seen; plump, juicy and scalding to near numbness. Big hit!  The Red Buds were an app, but enough for a meal, with a mix of braised bacon, pulled pork and melted cheddar. Nice take on traditional twice baked potatoes.  The salmon wasn't a large steak, but with the maple bacon thickened to a fire glaze, it was great. The mashed sweets were a mellow counterpoint.  The star of the show were the ribs. Meaty, tangy and suck off the bone awesome. There was no choice of finishes, but no one complained.  They were a great gnaw. We had no though of dessert.  \n\nThe inn facility is large and country comfortable, with downstairs and upstairs dining rooms and upside bar. No doubt we will have many happy returns.",

    "text": "Just so happens that Momma D's Soul Food 2 is down Broad Street from my Trenton office. I don't know why I hadn't tried it before now, but the good news is that I'm off the schnied. \n\nI ordered through the Yelp GrubHub connection, which was easy to do, and when I received the message that my Meatloaf, Yams, Fried Cabbage and Corn Bread meal was ready, I walked over to get it. The chef/manager/owner mistook me for the GrubHub delivery guy and addressed me as such a bit dismissively. An understandable mistake that we cleared up when we both realized that while I used that service, I was not of that agency. I was just the neighbor down the street come to pick up my food. Introductions completed, we parted on a first name basis. \n\nI want to remain on good terms with Momma D, because that first meal made a lasting first impression. It was fantastic. The meatloaf was loose, rather than dense, just the way my mother used to make from the recipe she found on an old Quaker Oats round box. Mixed with the rich dark brown gravy, it was a glorious romp down memory lane, complete with all the excess calories. The yams were soft and sweet, and the cabbage tender and nicely spiced. The cornbread was as good as a fresh squared corn muffin. There was more than enough in the carry out styro for at least two filling meals. Given that quantity, the value proposition was outstanding.\n\nThis kitchen also turns out other favorites; fried chicken, whiting and BBQ beef ribs, not to mention several other sides and desserts (peach cobbler, anyone?!) So, I will be back when I find myself working late and getting hungry. The choices are rich and fattening, so I will have to watch the urge to splurge. \n\nOnly suggestion - Improve the takeout containers to a grade that doesn't leak. I hated to lose all that gravy that I found in the bottom of the large plastic bag I carried it back to the office in. Otherwise, it was a home run.",
