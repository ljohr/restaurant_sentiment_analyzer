    "text": "Asian Taste Inn in the Huntingdon Valley Marketplace on County Line Road, is a primarily Chinese house owned by a Guangdong Province family, that has been turning out pretty good semi-authentic dishes for a while.  The space is well maintained with many booths and tables, and an amiable server corps dressed in tan and green that actually seems to enjoy interacting with their customers.  \n\nTrue to its cultural roots, the cuisine tends toward sweetness, and even their spicy dishes maintain a hint of sugar just behind the chili flavors.  Our Orange Beef and General Tso Shrimp came either drowned in heavy sweet amber, or had it on the side.  Both were framed in Broccoli Florets, the much overused non-Chinese veggie. Their tastes were fine, but we all commented on the unexpected sugariness of the platters.  The Spicy Shrimp, Scallop & Squid with Pepper Corn Salt, was a relief from the cane, and would have been completely on target had it all been crisper.  Finally, my sushi sample of an Eel & Avocado Roll was average, with much more Avo than Eel, and artificially colored Wasabe and Ginger.  \n\nBottom Line - The suburbs has taken the edge off the kitchen here.  Everything was accommodating to the local market.  Too much broccoli, and not enough real heat. Not bad if this is what you are looking for.",

    "text": "Came down to 40th Street to meet a good friend, and parked right in front of Tandoor India.  When he arrived, I asked where he wanted to go, and he pointed to the doorway right behind me.  Auspicious beginnings...\nFirst impression was of an old establishment somewhat in need of refurbishment, but with inviting scents of curry and coriander drawing us in.  I checked the buffet as we walked past to our table and saw an extensive collection of yellow, red, brown and rusty sauces, all looking fresh and inviting on a cold Sunday night.  The place was not crowded.  Settling in, I decided to take a look at the menu because I was not in the mood for a cascade of flavors and tastes, but wanted to relax with only a few.  We were given copies of the take out menu, which somewhat surprised me.  On the cover it said: \"We believe that the joy of eating lies in the art of fine cooking.\"\nI'll drink to that.\nWe ordered Tikka Masala (with Chicken), which came out in a fine pink sauce of tomato and ginger, and was quite good. The Baigan Bharta was tasty, but was chopped fine rather than with the chunky eggplant I expected.  They cheated a bit on the Garlic Naan by bringing us regular Naan painted with garlic butter.  It didn't work, as it was not integrated into the bread, but sat on the surface, and lacked the baked garlic pieces I love in true Garlic Naan.  A disappointing way to pay an extra buck. The Mango Lassi was pretty good,  but a little thin from using milk rather than yogurt.  A nice plate of rice came with the meal.  \nThis was a meal in which we were more engrossed in the conversation than attentive to our food.  The strong brotherhood carried the day, and the meal became background.  For the overall experience, I was quite satisfied.\nWe didn't solve any world problems, but agreed we would get together soon, and try again.",

    "text": "While the Shops At Liberty Place offer an architecturally interesting structure in a modern urban environment, and attracts people for both shopping and sightseeing the latest in city planning, it also likely represents a business model that will not succeed in the long run.  \n\nThe suburban mall made its presence felt as a post World War II phenomenon that mirrored the rapid growth of the automobile industry and the closely aligned migration of a generation of city dwellers into the countryside, a/k/a Suburbia.  They were the successful way to provide the \"stuff\" of life away from the urban core.  They worked well for almost 50 years.  But, as with most things, they were overdone, and failed to adapt to the changing demographics and cultural evolution that they spawned.  Walk through most malls today and you see lots of empty space, failing stores, and a subculture of youth versus elderly hangouts.  \n\nFirst the malls disrupted Main Street.  Then the Walmarts and Costco's of the world, disrupted the malls.  But, the disassociation from the communities where the consumer lived ultimately started to alienate them.  People wanted to return to their Main Street where possible.  More began to appreciate the quality of city life, and returned to the urban centers to once again live and work in the same place.  The suburbs began to lose its charm for many, especially those without young children.  \n\nThese reurbanified folk did not want to shop in malls along an inhuman highway, and certainly did not want to spend much time in a suburban style mall transplanted in the city.  The developers who thought otherwise, are wishing they had been smarter.  The retail franchisers and chain expanders were the last to catch on, but the growing list of failing stores and malls bear witness to this truth.  \n\nSo it is with the Shops of Freedom Place.  Fundamentally, a suburban marketplace miscast as a modern upscale urban experience that it turned out not enough people really wanted.  A J. Crew in a Center City suburban style mall just does not attract enough customers.  Never will. \n\nIt is not that such a public space could never work.  It can, but it requires a total reconfiguration that demonstrates an understanding of what people really want.  What is that?  A return to the village life, or that of the old neighborhood, where people knew each other, and felt like part of a community - in the city.  More impersonal and monotonous shopping is not where we are headed.  \n\nHow accomplish that?  Start by thinking in human scale.  Change part of the Liberty Place skyscrapers into condos and apartments for people to live.  Add a supermarket, cinema, child care, medical facility, and more greenery throughout the buildings.  Create a vertical village or neighborhood.  Where are the green grocer, the deli, the bakery, the corner tavern? \n\nThe central rotunda can still work as a gathering place for activities, but it should feel more like the gazebo in the middle of the public commons.  \n\nPeople want their cities to be state of the art, cutting edge, and full of energy and opportunity.  But, they also want to feel like it can take care of their needs and make them feel part of it, not overcome by it.  There are examples of this being done successful around the country and the planet.  Visit some of the new cities in Asia, and even some of the new age projects in New York, Seattle(JB) and San Francisco.  \n\nBring it down to human scale, and they will come and thrive.",

    "text": "I am just getting into BBQ in a bigger way, so when I saw Christopher D's review of Oink Johnson's Southern BBQ along with the few others, I had a strong impulse to drive up county and find out for myself what this place had to offer. It was a gorgeous early September afternoon special made for a open window stereo blazing cruise in the rolling Bucks countryside. I was in a good mood.\n\nDriving up 611 north of Doylestown with the GPS alerting me that I was at my destination, I still did not recognize it at first.  There is a small cabin on wheels sitting in the middle of the rocky parking lot, with a fruit stand on one side, and a puppy barn on the other.  That trailered shack was Oink's.  The front porch of the structure has two large BBQ grills, a large menu nailed to the wall.  Took a few seconds to get oriented, especially when this big fella with a white apron and big white mustache came over and looked down at me and said:\n\n\"What'll it be, young feller?\"\n\n\"Well, sir. I can't decide 'tween the Pulled Pork and the Brisket. What do ya think?\"\n\n\"They're both lip smackin' good, my man.  Can't go wrong with either.\" \n\nOk. I was hooked by ol' Oink's charm even before I made a choice.  This guy and the whole set up was right out of a Michener novel.  I was game to play my role. \n\nTwo of his buddies sat to the side of the shack under an old beer company umbrella watching this transaction.  I looked over to greet them with a reference to the weather, and they chawed back that maybe I should get one of both the pork and brisket. Nice upsell, gents. \n\nI ordered the Pulled Pork Sandwich, BBQ Beans and Corn Bread.  Oink disappeared into the enclosed portion of the hut on wheels to make his magic.  He appeared a few minutes later with a large white paper wrapped package that seemed too big to be a Sammy.  I couldn't see what was in it, which was just slightly troubling, but this man had such an aura of confidence that I let it slide thinking I was probably missing the point of just knowing it would be great without a need for a visual. \n\nThis place is strictly take out, so although I would have preferred to enjoy my BBQ on site, I had to take with and drive back home to eat it.  No biggie.\n\nUpon unwrapping the creation I found it was indeed a huge quantity of meat, but the roll had been saturated with pork and BBQ juices, and was too wet to eat. I ate the pork with a fork.  It was tender and juicy, yet the BBQ flavor was not very strong, and it was a bit salty for my palate. The Beans were richly dark brown, heavy with molasses and chunks of fat back bacon. Excellent. The Corn Bread in the form of a muffin was good, but not overly sweet nor moist. \n\nIf I could give a grade just for personality and appearance, Oink Johnson would be a 5 Star experience. But, as the Pulled Pork was not as good as others I have eaten, and the roll was a total loss, the food comes in at 2 Stars for me.\n\nI will get back there eventually to try the ribs and brisket, but I am disappointed by the lack of \"Zing\" in the Pulled Pork.\n\nStill, I recommend stopping in as the characters are wonderful, the locale very pretty farmland, and the food worth a sampling.",

    "text": "I found myself hungry around noon in Doylestown today, and decided to check out Hickory Kitchen for an early lunch. \n\nFirst impression was that this was an efficient, sunny, Main Street bistrot serving everything from soups to burgers to BBQ, with a large vegetarian option.  I almost went for the Special Bison Burger after having just had a Yelp discussion about buffalo burgers, but had eaten enough meat yesterday, and just didn't want more.  So, I went for the Grilled Veggie Quesadilla and home brewed Sweet Peach Iced Tea.  The chef and server got busy at the grill, and produced my meal in about 10 minutes. It came out on a small aluminum baking tray (clever), with Sour Cream, Salsa, and a bag of chips (?). \n\nThe Quesadilla was very good, and I could not finish it. It was full of chunky veggies and cheese.  The Iced Tea was fine, just lightly sweetened. Each table had three bottle rockets with three varieties of BBQ sauce - mustard, maple, and tomato based. I tried each of them on the quesadilla in place of the jar based salsa.  I liked them more than the salsa, and think HK is onto something as an alternative to the traditional accompaniment for Mexican dishes.  The mix of Mexi - BBQ could be a big hit (but, it is not Tex-Mex).\n\nThis review will likely be updated when I return to taste the BBQ options here. Most of the raves seem to be for the ribs, so I will get back for them. \n\nAll in all, a good first bite, but I can't say that I am drawn enough to return promptly that being a fan suggests.  A nice effort with potential.",

    "text": "Kelly's Kitchen is the actual name of this breakfast/lunch caf\u00e9 sitting at the bottom of Bristol Road in Bensalem.  It has a nice counter with about a dozen spinners, and an equal number of tables, but the kitchen is in the back of the house so you can't see the meals being prepared, nor smell of the bacon on the grill. \n\nThe service is good with prompt offers of coffee refills and light banter to make you feel at home.  My Kelly's Irish Omelet was a three egger with Onions, Peppers and Cheddar alongside a huge pile of crispy Home Fries, and Rye Toast.  I thought the eggs could have been lighter in texture if mixed with a little water before cooking, and there wasn't a whole lot of the veggies inside the eggs.  It was a bit underwhelming for a House Special.  The potatoes and toast were both fine.\n\nThe absence of credit card acceptance is annoying in today's world, and retailers who choose not to make their customer's lives easier in this regard should be called to account.  \n\nWhile the room and service were fine, the food was not consistently exceptional, and the Cash Only policy shows a lack of true concern for its customers.

    "text": "Grand Opening of Chinese take out joint on South Broad Street, Trenton.  \n\nIt has a postage stamp size dining area with only 2 tables for eating in, and 3 chairs for waiting on take away.  The space is still clean and the kitchen shiny, as it has been open little more than a week.  \n\nThe menu is extensive and basically a traditional Chinese/American emporium.  Nothing authentic, but if you wanted really good Chinois you would not be parking your wheels on S. Broad in the first place.  My Orange Flavored Chicken was a load in the styro container they give to even those who eat in.  The chicken was fresh enough, and had not been deeply frozen.  The sauce was gloopy orange colored, although the taste of the citrus was weak, despite the orange peel in the mix.  The Fried Rice was a bright yellow from the dye used in the bullion stock that morning.  It had plenty of roast pork and veggies in it, but I did not see much (if any) egg scrambled into it.  \n\nThe people here are Fuzhounese, the province just north of old Canton, and across the straits from Taiwan.  Their cuisine is similar to Cantonese, but has some other influences.  It tends toward less sweetness, but close enough to allow for success in the Chinese take out wars.  \n\nIf you are interested, go soon while everything is new and clean.  The owners are there and take an interest in getting things right.  Just remember what you are dealing with, and you will not be disappointed.\n\nPRO TIP - They don't serve hot tea!",

While the broth was standard, the wontons had exceptionally thick skin which detracted from the overall enjoyment of the bowl.  The Egg Foo Young was better, with fresh veggies and a decent brown sauce.

    "text": "Empress Garden is a small shop on N. 10th Street in Chinatown, Philly, that changed hands about a year ago.  The original owner (the \"Empress\"), was a sterling hostess and stunning beauty who ran her house efficiently and with admirable warmth.  The food had a Taiwanese and Indonesian orientation, but also had the standard American/Chinese dishes for those who preferred them.  Their fruit drinks were freshly squeezed, and it had a strong following. \n\nI returned after an absence of a few years, and my first run with the new operation.  While the menu was basically the same as before, the actual plates coming from the kitchen seemed to have lost a bit of their edge.  We ordered Scallion Pancakes, Curry Chicken with Onions, Salt & Pepper Pork Chops, Orange Beef and Saut\u00e9ed String Beans.  A lot for the three of us to consume, but we were looking forward to bring the balance home.  \n\nWhile the Scallion Pancakes were good, they are certainly returned to the norm, and were not as exceptional as remembered.  The Chicken dish had the right taste and fresh chicken, but the Onions were harder than desired, and thus tended to dominate the dish.  The S & P Pork Chops had been a wonderful platter in the past, but this day the breading and meat was over-deep fried, making it tougher in the bite, and less enjoyable in the chew.  Disappointing.  The Orange Beef was the best thing on our table, with a nice spicy, not overly gloopy, sauce.  It was fun to eat even with the orange peel in its soft non-burnt condition.  Finally, the Veggies were fine with a light Garlic finish.  \n\nThe meal was satisfactory, but not what I hoped for based on recollection.  Empress Garden was now just another Chinatown restaurant with a fair kitchen and price, but nothing to make it outstanding.",

It appeared to be the end of an iconic local institution that had been around, while changing hands, for nearly half a century.  Progress to some.  Loss of culture to others. \n\nThe \"best laid plans...sometimes go astray...\", and when the plans for the medical facility shrunk to a smaller piece of the strip mall, this corner was not included.

    "text": "Thirty years ago when I first moved to Bucks County from Trenton, Aldo's was only All Star Pizza in the Village Shires Shopping Center.  A generation later it has expanded into a nice size full fledged Italian restaurant named after its founder.  This all happened gradually, and it seemed to reflect the overall growth of this area. Farms began to grow suburban housing developments. Those new folks needed local places to eat. Etc. The dinners were good, and we could walk there from home.  \n\nStopped in for lunch the other day with my bud, Phil.  I guess I was in a rediscovery mood, as I had just visited Not Just Wings in the same center the weekend before.  We opted for a couple of plain slices for Phil, and an Eggplant Parmiagana Sandwich on a torpedo roll for me.  \n\nPhil knows from pizza (tomato pie) as he is from the Burg in Trenton.  I watched him hold each slice up to test their rigidity, and satisfied, devour them.  He smiled and said they were very good, but not like Papa used to make, or even his uncles DeLorenzo. \n\n The Parm was large, crusty and sealed in melted Mozza.  It, too, was decent, especially the toasted roll which was a joy to eat.  The Eggplant itself was cut into long, thick pieces, and were still a bit firm to the bite.  I prefer them to be completely soft from being saut\u00e9ed in light breading and olive oil before being torched in the pizza oven.  The Sauce was ok, but lacked a distinctive flavor.  I go for Eggplant Parm Sandys often, and this one passed the acceptable test, but did not stand out.  I would not rush back to have it again.  \n\nI may return for dinner in the near future, as they still evoke fond memories.  When I do, I will update this review.  But, for now, Aldo's for lunch is simply Okay. However, I may take a cue from Phil and stick with slices.",

    "text": "This is a franchised large format Japanese Hibachi house that also offers sushi and a few \"fusion\" offerings from China and Thailand.  This style restaurant seems to be coming into fashion on the East Coast, although it is more played out on the Left Coast. \n\nThis one is apparently under new management, and they are attempting to make the facility more comfortable and attractive.  They have done a good job on the creature comforts, and the service is also attentive, except for the minor language difficulties in understanding each other through the Korean and South Jerzee accents.  \n\nI was the guest this night, and my hostess did all the ordering.  I opted for the sushi side of the joint, although the Hibachi room was more active and colorful, especially when they performed their volcano show with the ball of fire shooting into the air.  Luckily, we could see that from the safe distance on the far side of the room.  \n\nThe Clear Soup was quite good as part of the dinner package.  The Sashimi platter (Deluxe?) was ample with a nice variety of well sliced fresh fish.  They all had good taste, but I would have preferred them slightly cooler.  I tasted all the offerings, but was not feeling compelled to finish them.  The Rolls (Sorry. The names were not disclosed to me) were okay, but not exciting.  Typical sushi rolls, but why the chef put cream cheese in it is beyond me.  Do they even have that in Japan?  This is not something I would consider ordering on my own.  Maybe this is what is popular in this part of South Jersey, or because it is close to Philly, cream cheese is a concession to local culture. Fish and cream cheese? No. Thank you!\n\nI was happy to have dinner with a friend, and content to let her treat in return for something I handled for her.  Still, something more authentically Japanese would tempt me more than this Korean version of an Americanized Japanese Hibachi/Sushi store.  It just didn't hang together for me.",

    "text": "Big Q BBQ sits out in front of H Mart and looks like a weird Sonic Drive In. \n\nI've only sampled their wares once; buying a St. Louis Ribs dinner and Fried Chicken platter with sides of Chak & Meez and Baked Beans with Ends.  Waiting in the antechamber felt a bit odd because while there were plenty of people in gray shirts in the kitchen, I did not see anyone working with the food.  Too, as someone else mentioned, there was no odor of smoked meats, nor BBQ sauces, nor even of frying chicken.  It was almost as if the food was prepared elsewhere and shipped here for sale.  No smoker outside, either. \n\nThe food is really just okay. The Chicken was the better of the main offerings.  The breasts were large and juicy, although the breading would have shone off with more spice.  The Ribs were dense and coated in a thick ruddy sauce, but it seemed that there was insufficient liquidity to really impact the meat.  It made for a dry texture with underwhelming flavor.  Knife and fork were helpful in separating meat from bone, and when gnawing at them with dirty fingers they were not particularly tender, but good enough to be worth the effort.  I prefer a looser presentation with more gravy, but that is a matter of taste.  \n\nThe sides were actually pretty good.  The Mac & Cheese was pretty much standard creamy fare, but the Beans were surprisingly hearty and well spiced.  \n\nNo rush to go back to Big Q, as there are better fried chicken places close by, and while a bit of up country driving is needed to find more authentic homespun Q, I would sooner cruise the countryside in search of that holy grail (or rack).",

The bar room where we ate was spacious on a weekday afternoon, and the service was friendly and informative.  \n\nWe opted for their 4 beer sampler to go with their self-proclaimed famous burgers and a cheesesteak.  At $8.50 for the 3 oz. glasses, the price was about right, and the offerings of national brew was tasty and interesting, although 2 of them had a pumpkin component in honor of the season.  They were fine.  \n\nThe burgers were large (8 oz.) with the appropriate fixings, although both of them came out beyond the medium finish requested, which, with an empty house was hard to understand other than inattentiveness at the grill. Their tastes were good, and the beef had not been frozen.  The cheesesteak was average and clearly not their forte. \n\nPlenty of HDTVs everywhere for those who want sports stimulation while eating or drinking (this is a sports bar), but not so overwhelming as to be a distraction to conversation.  \n\nAttractive house.  With more attention to detail, it could be an exceptional stop in an otherwise nondescript strip of Bucks County.",

It is very close to the historic Trenton Barracks, where Washington surprised the Hessians on Christmas Day, and began the turn around in the fortunes of the American Revolution that ended with the United States of America.  As such, if you stop in for a drink and/or a meal, be sure to tip your glass to the memory of those heroes.\n\nThe bar/dining room is right as you walk in the door. It is small and cozy. In good weather there is a back patio that is a nice space to hang. We sat is a half booth close to the bar. Service was very friendly and informative. \n\nWe ordered brisket, pulled pork sandwich and a third of a rack of ribs dinner with baked beans and mixed veggies. Each was pretty good, but none outstanding. They all needed help from the table rockets of sauces. Of those, the Hickory and 1911 were the best. When squirted up, the meats were more tasty and entertaining. The ribs were partially over grilled so that half of the three were charred and carbonized to a hard shell. Gave my molars a crunchy workout. The beans had been sitting around too long and lacked moisture. The veggies we're ample, but bland. \n\nWhile we liked the place, and that it is close to my office, we agreed that the Q was less than hoped for, and that we have had better recently at several places.\n\nMaybe it was just an off night.",

    "text": "Some say it is better to look good than to taste good. For those few, Brown's Bakery in Dublin, PA, is for you. \n\nA small shop with one community table, two deuces, and a tiny display case, there were beautiful pastries, donuts and cakes to see, but their tastiness was very much hit or miss. I was excited to finally visit, and although I was there shortly after noon, there was still ample choices available. I selected a half dozen donuts (old fashioned sour cream, glazed), coffeecake mini, brownie and sugar/cinnamon stick. The ten pieces came to $10 and change. Not unreasonable. \n\nI was 30 minutes from home, and I drove expectantly delaying gratification until I could brew fresh coffee and relax over my sweet score. Upon opening the taped box I beheld the beauties until deciding which to eat first. The sour cream cake donut with the cracks coated in glaze came first. I bent and broke it in half to better fit into my mouth. \n\nFirst bite was nice as the flavor of the icing and texture of the cake unveiled. Immediately thereafter I noticed that the foundational base was not completely fresh, but somewhat dry and becoming stale. Too, the flavor of the glaze was not what I anticipated, but a strange tone of sweetness unlike anything I had tasted. It wasn't bad, but it was less enjoyable than traditional dip. The same was true of the standard glaze siblings. Not completely at their peak, and the same weird flavor. \n\nOn the other hand, both the brownie and coffeecake were very good. The chocolate moist, rich semisweet and nicely chewy. The coffeecake chunky brown sugar, cinnamon and powdered sugar on top of a small rectangular pound cake base. Liked them alot.\n\nWhat to make of this mixed box? Hard to timestamp a pastry or donut. But, it is necessary to inquire about the age of their wares in order to avoid the suboptimal components. I have never done that, still if aging products are for sale it is necessary to be alert to this and do your due diligence.",

It lacks a counter and stools, which would provide a whole lot more charm than the current environment, which although clean, is all earth tones and lavender and has a dreary feel to it. \n\nI had to inquire about the Greek/Middle Eastern menu, as it was not provided with the main handout.  Too, said menu did not list the Gyro Pita, but required that it be asked for in order to know it was available.  I found that odd, except when I realized that most other things on the menu were more expensive that the gyro.  As I was there at lunchtime, the absence of the most popular dish in the reviews was dubious.  Oversight, or intentional subtle upsell? \n\nThe service was very good.  The Lamb Gyro was excellent with well grilled lamb slivers mixed with lettuce, onion, cucumber and yogurt dill sauce.  The pita was hot and the entire presentation attractive.  Even the frozen fries were okay.  \n\nWhile I will keep Rosemary's in mind when in the vicinity and in need of sustenance, it will not be a primary source for a Mediterranean style meal.  I have too many questions about the above issues, and there is too much strong competition nearby to put Rosemary on my speed dating list.",

It looks about the same on the outside, but there has been a modest makeover within making the space appear brighter and renewed.  The greeting by the staff was legit friendly, and the care provided throughout breakfast was very good. One of the servers actually came over to me to compliment me on my watch.  That is a very rare occurrence. \n\nI ordered the brioche French toast from the griddle menu.  At $6.99 is seemed reasonable.  The carafe of coffee was another $2.49 for a bottomless mug.  Still, getting out from a full breakfast for under $10, was appreciated.  Yet, there must have been a little communication problem with I did not catch until my food was served.  My very pleasant server came back to me after ordering to ask if I wanted blueberries or peaches with my breakfast.  I hadn't originally asked for that. Nothing was said about an up charge, and I thought it was something everyone was offered with this meal.  In fact, it wasn't.  The extra canned peaches, caramel-like syrup and dollop of whipped cream was another buck fifty.  No biggie, but I would have preferred to be told the complete deal.  \n\nThe food itself was good, but too sweet with the syrup they drowned the bread with.  I have a lighter touch on breakfast syrup.  \n\nI would return, but be sure to be prepared for the attempt to upcharge for extras I really did not need.",

It is all glass, stainless and jutting ascending red roofline, staffed by high school cuties that bring the innocence necessary for a complete summer childhood reverie.  It sits at the bottom of Veterans Highway, just south of New Falls Road in Levittown, PA., across from a long row of old strip commercial drive ups that help complete the sense that you are more than just an ice cream licker, but also a time traveler.  \n\nThe Store carries mostly hard 'scream, with a nod to vanilla and chocolate soft serve. Given the lack of choice compared to its siblings in the area that offer at least a few more soft flavors, I went with Black Raspberry and Butter Pecan in a medium paper cup.  At $3.50, it was a steal, or more accurately, confirmation that I had entered 1976.  \n\nThe only real issue here is that the creme glace was not as good as the other joints in the area.  Not sure who makes their brand, but it had a flat taste; nor was it as creamy and sweet as expected.  The Butter Pecan had fewer nutty implants, and lacked the mild saltiness of the pecan that so well offsets the usual sugar rush on the tongue.  The Black Raspberry had a mildly tart afterbite. Not bad, but had me wondering why it was there.  \n\nAfter the individual scoops melted and merged into each other, it was more enjoyable.  Still, not the heavy smooth happy zazz found in Jo-Jo's, nor the amazing cool creaminess of Dairy Delight.",

The chicken consume base was tasty, and the wontons, although somewhat thick skinned, actually had a decent flavor, too. The general's chicken was a large mound of amber glossed bird nuggets. About half of them were the right texture and taste, while the others were either too thickly skinned, or too crunchy to enjoy. Could not always taste the meat within. The fried rice was a large helping with adequate veggies to keep it interesting. Of course, the broccoli florets were there for decoration more than consumption. \n\nThe meal was just okay overall.  I appreciated that there was a dining room where I could sit and eat lunch.  It would have been even better if they used real plates and flatware, rather than styro and plastic, and a take out container for the soup.  Service was provided by the cashier who was attractive and pleasant to all customers.  \n\nThe sign out front is worn and faded, and could use a little TLC to keep the shop from looking worse than it is. A little fresh paint and relettering would make China Chef a more upbeat place to chow down (no pun intended).",

The three workers there seem primarily involved in the preparation of the food, although someone came out to either take a walk up  order, or to hand over the boxed food if ordered online.  \n\nWe had ordered through the internet from the not totally user friendly Pizza Hut app.  I finally figured out how to get it done, and requested the large Traditional Pan Pizza with half Mushroom and half Italian Sausage be ready for us by 6:00.  \n\nWhen we arrived at 5:55, the pizza was busy baking and we were told it would be ready shortly.  It was.  We saw it emerge from the oven (see pic).  I had ordered the Fire Spice finish for the crust, so we watched as one of the assembly dudes painted on some oil around the circumference of the wheel and then sprinkled on crushed red pepper.  He then cut it up with a semi-circular blade, and slid it into its box.  The internet price was $7.99, which is very hard to beat.  \n\nHow was it?  The deep dish values of a thicker crust were obvious, although it could have used more baking on the under carriage to make it more well done.  The topside was loaded with our requested shrooms and sausage, and well baked to a nice melt.  It would seem that a small oven adjustment to increase the heat on the bottom and reduce it on top would result in a better finished product, if that is possible.  Taste was decent, but due to the above heat distribution, its texture was a bit off, and the bottom crust not crisp enough.  \n\nHealth code wise, it was apparent that no one was using latex gloves for the food prep.  That was a violation and a turn off.  There is plenty of better pizza in the area, not to mention across the mighty Delaware River.  This place will do in a pinch.",

Standing in line or waiting for an order creates a sense that time has slowed down, and even the dust in the sunbeams may have danced for our forefathers. The combination of Korean style double fried chicken and deep dive dough balls is a natural fit for preparation, but I am not yet comfortable eating both at the same seating. The double dose of fats challenges my guilt. \n\nWhen we arrived mid-Saturday afternoon, all of the fancies were gone, but the 3 daily offerings were available.  Folks were gnawing on their chicken bones at the counter, blissful in their enjoyment.  We ordered a half doz mix of Vanilla Spice, Maple Brown Sugar and Strawberry Lavender to take with us on the drive home.  They were individually bagged while hot, and placed in a larger paper bag, and ultimately triple bagged in a plastic take out carrier.  \n\nOpening the package, the heat and moisture has made the paper sacks damp, but still held in plenty of the essence of the dough wheels. We tried a Vanilla Spice.  It was covered in sugar and cinnamon, cake-like, and uber sweet. The bite and chew was pleasant, but there was no crispness due to the water vapors.  Very tasty.  A very good donut.  Over the next day, the rest were devoured, and although the taste varied with content, the general experience was the same.  A nice round piece of cake with a hole in the middle. \n\nFederal Donuts deserves another house call earlier in the day when the fancies are in stock, and again for a unique fried chicken experience, which seems as varied as the sweet fat tires. \nAfter those ingestions, an update will be in order. \n\nUntil then, the consumed donuts themselves were not life altering, but were certain A-Okay!",

    "text": "When the sign on the front door says, \"DO NOT ENTER WITH HOODIE OR MASK...IF SO YOU ARE NOW TRESPASSING,\" you know there is a fundamental problem being expressed by management.  This isn't the best neighborhood in the Capital City, in fact, it is one of the worst. I wouldn't be found here at night, but for a quick lunch with parking right out front, and Trenton's finest stopping in for take out, I felt pretty safe as I dined on my Eggplant Parm Sandwich.  \n\nThe loaf was fresh, mildly crunchy and had a good mild yeasty flavor.  The Eggplant had been saut\u00e9ed in a frying pan with extra virgin olive oil before being finished in the pizza oven to melt the cheese and seal the final product.  It was a good sandwich, even if not the lunch of the gods. \n\nService was friendly, if a little jumpy.  Only four booths for eating in.  Same ownership for 23 years.  \n\nI guess they have seen the hood change during that time.  How many holdups before the sign went up?  \n\nNo doubt, one was enough.",

    "text": "I have been on a fried chicken binge lately, and when in that frame of mind any source of crispy skinned plump breasted chicken can capture my attention. Popeye's is no exception. \n\nSo it was, as I drove over to Prince's to give it another try, that I saw the bright orange sign and building for the Popeye's on North Olden.  Impulse got the better of me and I made the hard left into their drive thru line.  I had difficulty deciphering the menu, so I just ordered a few pieces breasts and wings. Seems I had to order a side and a drink or they couldn't handle my order. It turned out to be cheaper if I did one of their combos rather than just individual pieces. \n\nWhen I arrived home and opened the box I beheld a large breast and wing that were bigger than I had seen on most chickens. It had me wondering what they feed those birds. The coating was as bright orange as the box it came in, and deeply textured.  Perhaps, the cumin and chili in the Spicy option affected the presentation. \n\nThe meat was still moist and very tasty.  Each piece was much larger than what I had sampled at the other place the week before.  The chicken easily parted from the bone and my fingers pulled off most of what was edible.  The rest I worked over with a fork to get into all the bone crannies. \n\nThe side dish (coleslaw) was pedestrian, and the biscuit was fairly deflated by the time I  got to it.  So, the thing to do is order the combo, throw away the sides and biscuit and go to town on the chicken itself.  \n\nIt may not be the same as what is available in those little chicken shacks on the side of the road in Virginia or North Carolina, but it will do nicely up in Jersey on a wintery night.",

    "text": "Visiting this McDonald franchise on S. Oxford Valley Road in Fairless Hills, Pa., was the first time that the drive up experience took me by surprise.  \n\nFirst, the voice taking orders was amazingly pleasant.  She seemed to be into her job and sincerely asked how I was doing, and how she could help.  The repartee was longer than expected, and warm throughout.  She didn't seem fazed that I was ordering a small meal off the Cheapo menu, and that the items cost less than $4.  \n\nSecond, this was the first fast food interaction where I was handed a separate plastic bag with napkins and straw.  Someone realized that cleanliness and ease of transfer were important.  So much better than finding those things stuffed into the bag, or worse, not provided at all.  \n\nThese made for a positive impression of this Mickey D's, and would have led to a higher star rank had the actual Double Cheese Burger been hot off the grill.  Not even close.  Barely lukewarm.  McDonald's burgers are not good enough to be enjoyed at low temp.  Their components start separating and the taste/texture is disjointed.\n\nBut, if they ever get that part right, this shop would really stand out.",

Glad I put on my big boy pants and drove out there for lunch Friday afternoon, because it is a nice shop with everything made in house, and friendly folks. \n\nI sat at one of the few booths, in sight of the HDTV showing Trump's inauguration with commentary. Ordered the eggplant parmesan sandwich, and pulled a Coke Zero from the cooler. Even got to read the complementary Trentonian rag that was on my table. \n\nThe hot sandwich was a foot long, cut in half, and loaded with thin slices of breadcrumb coated, olive oil pan sauteed, deep purple nightshade. It was topped with a layer of mozza and finally a thick chunky red gravy. It was so big, I decided to use knife and fork rather than attempt direct oral assault. It was delicious and filling. I should have asked for extra sauce on the side, because the eggplant overwhelmed the top dressing, and more dipping would have made the lunch even better. Not complaining. It was excellent. I chose to leave most of the roll aside so I could concentrate on the prize. \n\nWill return for their pizza and tomato pie and revisit Mario's star power, without the political commentary.",

We found what we needed, and after reading a few of the labels, made a choice in remote garage openers (serious shit, I know!). After we got it home and read the fine print inside the packaging, I realized that my machines are antiques and several generations behind contemporary technology.  Seems 1993 was the cut off date for the latest radio frequency devices, while mine are a few years older.  How can such things that still work well be obsolete? \n\nSo, had to return it today to my local THD, and go with the Genie brand, which, after all, were the ones I installed originally.  Only they make the expensive key to maintain their own stuff. \n\nShould have the code mastered soon, and have two functioning remote door openers to allow for ease of access and egress for both old and new(er) vehicles. \n\nNow I know more than I ever wanted to know about remote garage door openers. \n\n Ah, wisdom!",

    "text": "It seems that Pho Tan, the first and only Vietnamese pho house in Trenton, NJ, has been sold, and is now under new management.  \"Pho Friendly,\" is a catchy name, and hopefully its positive personality carries with it both the good will of the old shop, and the high expectations of the new.  \n\nI stopped in yesterday on my way to visit a client at his home.  They are in the same neighborhood.  Driving by, I saw the new sign hanging over the storefront and was immediate both sad and curious.  Street parking can be a problem, but I found space right around the corner, walked back and went in.  Looked exactly the same as before (it was a Mexican resto before it went Asian).  The menu was identical.  There were new handwritten signs on the walls saying, \" We Have Hoagies. $5.\"  I love the traditional Banh Mi sandwich, so I asked the woman who greeted me if they made them.  She pointed to the sign and nodded her head.  \n\nA keener mind might have thought to confirm that their hoagie was in fact the same as the Banh Mi.  I did not ask for clarification, and ordered a chicken version with the vision that it would be all dressed up in a French Baguette, with daikon, cilantro, jalapeno, etc. \n\nNot exactly. \n\nRather, it was more of a chicken steak sandwich with a twist.  Plenty of sliced bird bathed in Hoisin Sauce, with medallions of cucumber, saut\u00e9ed onions & green pepper, with some Sriracha mayo, in a poor quality hoagie roll that lacked any crispness or good texture.  No daikon, cilantro, jalapeno to be found.  \n\nDisappointing. It wasn't bad, but not what I was looking forward to. \n\nI did not try the namesake pho, so it is possible they do that well enough to redeem themselves.  In truth, I should have been more alert to the fact that they now advertise themselves as offering Thai and Chinese food in addition to Viet.  I would venture a guess that the lovely proprietress who served me (and her husband) are Chinese, and are attempting a \"fusion\" house, but with Chinese culinary sensibilities.  That is not necessarily a bad thing, but it does require the customer to find out what they really do best. Obviously, it isn't Banh Mi.\n\n2.5 Stars with a dose of disappointment.",

    "text": "Hing Wah is a Chinese take out house on New Falls Road, Levittown, PA, that also has a couple of tables for those who prefer to eat in while the food is optimal. It is fairly representative of the genre, with a menu that you could have memorized from most others you have tried in life. Only significant difference was the friendliness of the owners, both of whom engaged in small talk with me both before and after the meal. Nice folks.\n\nMy lunch special consisted of wonton soup, pork fried rice and general tso's chicken. The consomm\u00e9 was standard chicken stock with two thick skinned wontons and fresh cut scallion greens. No pork or other floaties to be found. Still, it was unobjectionable, even if unimaginative. The fried rice was dyed dark yellow, but had enough veggies mixed in to keep it interesting. The general would have been satisfied as I was, with the quantity of the chicken morsels breaded and deep fried with a dark red amber goop slathered on top.  There were actual Szechuan red chili peppers within adding to the pleasurable heat encountered with each bite. The breading was reasonable and did not overwhelm the bird beneath. \n\nFor around $7 plus tax, lunch was decent and a reasonable value proposition. It fulfilled my weekly yen for typical Chinese/American grub.",

Nice to have the convenience of grabbing the necessities of life (bagels & fried rice) in one stop. \n\nThere are only four tables in the house, so it is primarily a takeaway joint, but I prefer to sit and eat while the wok burn is paramount. Folks are a husband wife team, with the old man at the stove and frau tickling the register keys. She is friendly and bilingual. As a first timer, I ordered the General Tso's Chicken lunch special, which came with choice of rice and egg roll or cold drink bottle. I asked for it extra spicy. \n\nIt arrived in take out regalia on a plastic tray; thin white fork on the side. The tso sauce was a beautiful red amber color that matched well with the hyper yellow of the fried rice. There were a few Szechuan peppers thrown in in answer to my request. It was thick, but had decent flavor. The chicken was over-breaded, making for unnecessary heaviness. Had it been thinner, it could have been a contender for a surprisingly good rendition. As it was, it was about average for the genre. I left most of the rice behind as it made too long before my arrival. \n\nThis wasn't a bad meal, but it could have been alot better given the apparent skill level in the kitchen.",

Took the rest home. \n\nThey did bring two bowls of red/green salsa to me, but the chips never arrived.

At $2 for the \"small\" size, it was the bargain of the day.  \n\nGiven a choice between this \"Mexico City Woman\" restaurant and El Primo about 100 feet away, I would go with El Primo based on more choices and stronger kitchen talent, although the former rice drink was more flavorful than the later. \n\nNorristown and environs continues to impress with its broad array of comidas Latina Americanas.",

I ordered penne aglio olio with saut\u00e9ed spinach in a lunch portion, and they knew what to do. After about 5 minutes I was called to the counter to pick up a side salad and bread basket. The greens were plentiful, with tomato wedges, iceberg, red onion, cukes and sliced carrots. Actually, took me by surprise. The four slices of Italian loaf were fresh and ready for dipping into balsamic vinaigrette and the garlicy broth to come at the bottom of the pasta bowl. \n\nA few minutes later, the white soup bowl of pasta was on the counter calling my name. I walked over to get it, and enjoyed the hot garlic breath of the dish wafting into my face. Smelled so good. The taste was about right, too. Plenty of pencil points under a nice load of soft spinach. The garlic could have been more golden, but no biggie.\n\nThe only difficulty I confronted was the large pond of garlic water under the pasta. No matter how long I waited to allow the water to drain from each forkful, it was still dripping onto my shirt, pants and tie. I was careful, but all will be visiting the cleaners to get the stains out. My bad for not bringing a long bib. \n\nThe store needed a strong cleaning, too.

There are HDTVs on every wall in the bar and dining room, so it is definitely a sports bar, too.  \n\nOn a weeknight the rectangular bar has several couples sitting around having dinner and  drinks.  The dining area was lightly populated with a few families in booths or tables.  It was both a young and old crowd, but as it seemed to be smoke free, it wasn't conducive to the rowdy bunch often found across the street.  \n\nThe beer on tap is limited to basic American suds, but that is not a problem for the folks here.  Yuengling Lager was about as exotic as it got.  Still, at a couple of bucks for a pint I wasn't complaining.  The same holds for the kitchen offerings.  Several pages of standard American fare, including pizza, burgers, sandwiches and a long list of diner-esque dishes.  My Patty Melt was decent, but served naked on the plate, without even chips or pickle.  At a price shy of $7., I certainly received what I paid for.  \n\nKasdon's has been around for a while, and it shows in the d\u00e9cor and long term servers/tenders.  It is a relatively safe place for a few drinks, chow and conversation with the people at and within the bar.  Families are also welcome.  \n\nAfter a few stops at the lanes nearby, where the crowd can be loud and obnoxious (although with better grub), Kasdon's feels to be a safe harbor.",

They were friendly and attentive, if a bit sloppily garbed for the customer service end of the business.  \n\nI ordered a Chicken Salad with Swiss Sub on a Sesame Seed Torpedo.  It was prepared quickly and presented to me already wrapped in white paper and sealed with tape.  When I reached the office, I opened it up to see a nice sized hoagie with plenty of chicken salad, cheese, sweet hot peppers and lettuce.  This was two meals.  I immediately appreciated the cost factor.  The first bite told me the roll was good quality and fresh.  The chicken was also of very recent vintage with large chunks in light mayo.  The Swiss had a pleasing tart nuttiness, and the peppers added an element of caliente zest. All in all, a pretty good sandy.  Compared to an alternative like Primo's, Haley's was better to my taste.  \n\nHaley's won't be part of my regular lunch rotation due to location and comparatives.  However, I will have no hesitancy returning there when the mood strikes, and sample other savories from his menu.  The Cheesesteaks seemed to be popular when I was there, and the people eating there, quite comfortable.",

The bowl was smaller than at other VN locales, but tasty and well presented with a full plate of accessories (spouts, lime, jalapenos,basil leaves).  The flank steak was thin and lean.  The broth as doctored at the table, spicy and engaging.  The noodles, soft and of adequate volume.  At $6.95, it was exactly what I wanted for a light lunch.\n\nThe Vietnamese coffee was also very satisfying.  \n\nI need to visit a few more times and try more on the menu before coming to a final opinion on this pleasant fixture on the edge of Chinatown.",

    "text": "Morrisville has a surprising number of luncheonette and deli places that turn out a broad variety of primarily breakfast and lunch dishes.  Always on the lookout for an easier way to get into Trenton on a weekday, the Morrisville-Trenton crossings are often the least trafficked.  On my way, I like to stop for breakfast when time permits, and hit the bridges around 8:45 when the flow of cars improves. \n\nSo, I recently found Ben's Delicatessen on Bridge Street just a hop, skip and jump from the Trenton Makes Bridge.  Parking is fairly easy with a side parking lot, and once inside the ordering/paying/take away system is very efficient.  They def have it down to a tight discipline.  The crowd is primarily dudes in work boots and company logo shirts, with a few local office or retail folks thrown in.  I was the only suit. \n\nI ordered their 4 piece French Toast, thinking it would be two halved slices of bread at the ridic price of $3.95.  Wrong.  It was four full slices.  Pleasant surprise.  I stood near the short order grill and watched the spatula man work at hyper speed to get the orders out and moved down the conveyor line to the packer and cashier.  Luckily, I was not overly concerned with the fact that a large coil of pork sausage was its neighbor on the grill, sharing its oozing juices with my egg soaked bread.  \n\nWhen I finally took possession of my meal, it was tossed on a styro plate, and placed on a plastic tray for me to carry to a table.  Plastic utensils completed the composition.  The bottom of the plate was not flat, and as I tried to cut the toast with fork and knife, it would spin on the tray, making surgical precision impossible.  The cook clearly did not have a concern for creating a quality dish, as the toast had an eggy top with dry center, suggesting insufficient time in pre-grill soak and absorption.   It was low average at best.  The coffee was fine.  \n\nGiven what I saw of the operation as I waited, I realized that breakfast sandwiches were the way to go here, and I will return to give one a try.  Clearly, Ben's is a beehive of activity in the morning, and has a loyal following.  For now, it deserves the benefit of the doubt that most of what they do is decent or better\n\nNOVEMBER 12, 2014 - Returned today for another breakfast, and went with one of my favorites, Sausage, Egg & Cheese on a Kaiser Roll.  That and a large Coffee set me back only $3.99!  Amazing prices. \n\nThe sandwich was very good.  The Sausage Patty was at least 4\" in diameter, the Egg Fried, and Cheese American, and the Roll fresh and nicely chewy.  I enjoyed every bite and finished with a satisfied stomach.  The Coffee was hot and pleasant tasting and I appreciated the milk option as opposed to only half & half or those mini moos flavor alternatives. I sat and enjoyed my early repast with several other guys preparing to start their days.  \n\nAlthough not intentionally so, Ben's does have a men's club feel to it, as the only women I see aside from those who work there, order take out and don't hang out with us fellas watching the news or ESPN. \n\nI'll stop back again and try something else, and if as good as my sandwich today, be in the mood to move up the ranking to a brighter star.",

It offers a wide variety of traditional and more modern twists on the bagel genre.  \n\nThe bagels are large.  They have the right mildly crunchy exterior, but an interior that is a little too dense for me. That just means that it is kneaded too long before boiling, removing the air pockets that create a lighter product.  Sometimes the only way to know if the density is wrong is to wait to see what happens in its digestion.  When I get indigestion and a lingering aftertaste, I know it was not quite right. \n\nStill, they use extra large baked onion chips on their bagels, and apply them evenly on both sides. All good.  \n\nI am sure that these rounders hold up very well clamping down on a heavy sandwich, and they certainly have their fans.  But for me, a lighter chew is preferable.  In my bagel quest throughout Bucks County, Bagel Train in Yardley comes closest to my desired Golden Fleece.",

The staff is friendly, attentive, and knowledgeable about the menu and specials. \n \nThis was our first visit, and came before basketball practice, so we had to eat light.  We limited ourselves to a Cheese Steak and Chicken Parm sandwiches.  The Cheese Steak was the better of the two.  Very tasty on a good Italian Roll.  The Chicken Parm was OK, but falling into the average range of similar fare in the area.  A really nice touch was the plate of Red Pepper and Onion in Olive Oil offered with the bread basket. The former fit perfectly on the later, and the taste was very pleasant, a vastly superior approach to the more traditional pats of butter (also in the basket), or herbed olive oil.  \n\nWe agreed that we enjoyed our repast, and wanted to return to sample some of the dinners (Francaise, Marsala, aglio olio), pizza, and pizza rolls (never had these before, but have great reviews).  \n\nLook for updated review in the next few weeks.",

    "text": "First visit to Cantina Dos Segundos, and the impression was overall positive. Small tables line the sidewalk on a hot night in very late May. People engaged in talk and drink. Lots of smiles and glances. \nStepping inside, hit with a wave of sound from the multitude of conversations at the bar to the right, and dining area to the left.  The bar looks interesting and worth a sit when less crowded. A wall of tequila looks like an arcade game where balls are thrown to knock them down. That would be a shameful waste of great glass. \nWe were led to a deuce in the very back without a wait at 7:15. As recommended, I had a Blood Orange Margarita (rocks, no salt). The bartender in me marveled at its prompt delivery on a busy night, and the good taste slipping past my lips from the chilled glass. Chips and 2 salsas (Verde slightly better than the Rojo) arrived before we pushed in our chairs.  Generally, I prefer a chunkier salsa with some tropical fruit in it, but this wasn't bad. The chips were not all that tasty, nor textured, but went well with the thinness of the salsa. \nThe Poblano Chicken Chimichanga was very good, and surprisingly had thin sliced apples inside along with the expected pulled chicken, beans, rice and cheese. I tried the Yuca(sic) Fries, and they were quite good with a Chipotle Mayo dipping sauce rather than ketchup.  \nThe Tilapia Tacos were also pretty good, but the fish could have been more flavorful to compete with the stronger accompaniment in the tortillas. Still, this is not a serious complaint, just a realization that Tilapia may be too mild to handle the heavy chilliness of the spices. Generally, Mexican style seafood is my favorite. (Reminds me of the time in Ensenada...)\nThe waitstaff was friendly, helpful and efficient on a busy Friday night. \n\nOnly downside - Poor acoustics and way too noisy for talking. \n\nCertainly come for happy hour and a zillion tequila options. Think twice if you want a romantic evening in a quiet corner.  This is not that place.",

The public area is crammed with pastas and bottled/canned goods to assist in preparing a complete meal.  \n\nWhile it seems certain that their lunch and catering efforts are the primary focus of the business, they are also open early in the morning and advertising breakfast options.

They did have a few bagels, muffins and pour-your-own java for my crowd.  \n\nI opted for a Bagel, Butter and Cheese with a small cuppa joe to go.  The bagel was clearly not from their oven and was not exactly fresh.  The taste was okay, but required extra chewing to get it down.  The coffee was that Law brand; clearly offered merely as a convenience without an attempt at truly good caf\u00e9.  \n\nOverall, Chiarello's is not a morning place, but I might return for one of their more auspicious sandwich creations.",

I first discovered it a few months ago when visiting my attorney who also has a rear entrance backing onto the semi-hidden shops in between the main streets and small pocket parking lots.  Finally stopped in yesterday to grab some Joe and have a look.  \n\nFirst impression was that the space is much larger than anticipated.  The floor plan is spread out in two rooms, with many comfortable spots to settle in on a sofa, or work at a table.  There is even room for a piano in the middle of the main room.  The work space is in a corner by the entrance, which might be a problem if crowded, but when I arrived shortly after 11, there was only one person ahead of me on line.  I liked the vibe with all the natural colors and clubby furniture.  The southern orientation allowed sunlight to filter in softly in winter, creating a warm glowing ambiance.  I got the \"Zen\" reference, but doubted there would be much opportunity to meditate or chant there.  Caffeine takes people in another direction.  \n\nI went with a Caf\u00e9 Au Lait and Blueberry Muffin for my first try.  The price was under $5, so I immediately thought it compared favorably to the Star$$$ of the world, where the same would have been a few bucks more.  The taste of the coffee was okay, but nothing special.  Likewise, the muffin while fresh, had a commercial bakery quality to it. Certainly edible, but lacking a spark of organic energy.  \n\nI will return to obtain a more representative sampling of the goods @ ZD, but at first blush, it seems a nice place for coffee and conversation, but not necessarily the first place I would think of for outstanding coffee.  \n\nNonna's is the place to go for that.",

Smiling, she whispered so no one but me could hear her; \"You don't buy them here unless you want to spend a lot and then hire someone to cut and sew them for you.  I suggest you go to another store not so far from here that specializes in premade window dressings of all types.  They have a large collection and have good prices.\"  \n\nConfirming the spelling of the other place, I thanked her for the exact assistance I needed, and walked back to my car to see if I could find it on Yelp.

    "text": "Christine's Restaurant is difficult to figure. \n\nFirst blush, the space is warm and cozy in a clubby kind of way, with lots of dark wood tones, white tablecloths, and plenty of windows.  All good.  Then, the menu says it is an Italian shop, which is something of a surprise as it gives no hint of its ethnic orientation.  So what? If the food is good Italian I don't care if it looks like a rib joint. \n\nNext, checking the menu, it offers breakfast until 1:00. The prime item is Eggs Benedict - not exactly created in Palermo.  The breakdown is in Sandwiches/Wraps; Burgers; Pasta; Salads, and Entrees.  The pasta is the only strong hint that maybe this is where their specialty resides, but I am thinking, \"Pasta in this place?\" I still didn't get that this was home base for the kitchen.  So, I had the Florentine Chicken Sandwich and a side of Classic Caesar Salad.  \n\nThe wedgie was grilled chicken, garlic sauteed spinach, with a melted cheese over the top.  I think the menu said the cheese was pepper jack, which would have been better than the too mild provolone that dressed the other main ingredients.  Too, the roll it came out on was fresh, but not Italian crusty.  It was a little non-descript, and although it carried the sandwich, failed to really pull its weight.  I left most of it on the plate to concentrate on the spinach and chicken.  It was not worth the calories.  \n\nOn the other hand, the Caesar was quite good, with crisp romaine, homecrunched croutons, and a decent creamy dressing.  It actually saved the day, as it more than complements the sandwich.  If anything, it was the other way around.  \n\nThe whole experience was a little topsy turvy. The side became the star of the show, and the supposedly dominant aspect of the plate was left in partial obscurity.  \n\nThe staff was friendly, informed and timely.  \n\nThere seems to be an identity crisis at Christine's.

The breading was not overly thick, and the sauce was freshly made with chili flakes noticeable in the dark amber covering. The fried rice was a weak point, as it was mass produced with a yellow dye and few veggies, meat or egg.  \n\nWith a bottle of Snapple, it was a $7 deal. \n\nIt was A-OK!",

    "text": "DeLorenzo's Pizza sits in the corner of the old strip Fairview Shopping Center on Trenton Road, Fairless Hills, Pa.  As the saying goes, \"...Nothing is less fair than living in the Hills...\" The oldest part of the establishment where the cashier is, is tiny with 2 tables.  It has its old Bucks charm, but is certainly gritty round the edges.  Only one table was available for this solitary traveler, as the other was being used as the office by the owner/manager (who spoke with a pronounced Russian accent).  \n\nThe staff was friendly and the young cooks seemed to know what they were doing.  The most unusual aspect for this pizza joint was that it lacked the display of all their pizza option, so prevalent in most shops these days.  No. They had only one regular pie behind the counter, and they were willing to put anything you wanted on top of it.  (Well, maybe not ANYTHING...) That was refreshingly old school. At least I knew they weren't in the habit of making a multitude of pizzas with various toppings just so customers could pick from among them, even if they had been sitting there all day.  I ordered one plain slice and a sweet Italian Sausage triangle.  \n\nThey arrived well done as I wished.  The regular slice had a good crunch, but leaked a bit of oil when tilted.  The taste was good.  The Sausage slice had been thickly spread with crumbled meat, yet it held up well.  The taste was even better.  This snack with a small Coke came in under $5. I threw the change into the tip jar.  \n\nThe other side of the house had a dim, but pleasant appearing dining room.  The patrons all had large plates of food before them.  Looked interesting. \n\nIf I return, I will sit over there so I can join the other diners, rather than watch the boss train the servers and pay his bills.",

    "text": "FireGirl Mexican Kitchen sits in a less than state of the art strip mall on Street Road in Bensalem, Pa.  Word is that in a past life it was also a Mexican joint called Tortilla Flats.  Someone has a talent for interesting names. \n\nWe stopped in on Sunday for a late lunch in the midst of shopping in the vicinity. The large room was brightly painted with unusual lighting fixtures and plenty of tables, low and high, for dining.  Ordered were taken at the back cashier stand by a friendly native who was happy to explain how their system worked, and to quickly agree that their Flautas were a good way to go.  \n\nThey arrived at our high top about 10 minutes later.  Rather than the normal flute-like crunchy tubes stuffed with Chicken, Cheese, and Peppers, this version was more of a roll up or wrap. The three filled tortillas had been sliced amidship after deep fryin, and were still soft rather than rigid.  In the middle of the plastic basket were small containers of Guacomole, Salsa, Cheese Sauce and Sour Cream.  While we were waiting we located the Hot Sauce Bar against the rear side wall, and brought back several small cups of various blasters to try with our meal.  All were good, but the Spicy Peach Sauce was far and away our favorite due to its sweet/heat quotient.  Tasted great poured onto each Flauta and immediately consumed.  \n\nThe order was enough for both of us.  The taste was fine, if not completely authentic.  It was definitely designed for the American palette, which is not a bad thing.  They know their audience.  \n\nI don't get to this part of Street Road often, but will be returning in a few weeks to pick up something ordered at the curtain shop next door.  If hungry when I arrive, I would not mind returning to FireGirl to see what else they have in the kitchen.",

    "text": "When a comfort food restaurant is empty at 7:30 pm on a Sunday night, there is reason to think that perhaps that is saying something about the operation there. That was what we faced on a damp March night, but we were already inside, and as the old saying goes: \"What the hey?!\" \n\nTurns out that with the smoker out front, and a good chef in the kitchen, the food was pretty good.  Only problem was the slightly weird attitude of management that wanted our business, but at the same time had a series of rules they felt compelled to enforce while we ordered. First, they were closing in 30 minutes, which meant we had to order quickly.  We could eat inside while they cleaned up.  Second, our sandwiches came with fries, but any other side order was an extra buck. I wanted baked beans. Okay, bud, but fork over the sawback. Third, a medium burger wasn't possible because the health code required everything be grilled to well done.  What if I didn't like an over cooked burger?  They couldn't help me officially, but they did ask the chef to take it off the heat while still pink.  He said he would with a wink. \n\nUltimately, the brisket sandwich was quite tasty, with a nice rub making a flavorful bark.  It might have benefited from another hour in the smoker to make the beef more tender, but it was decent as it was.  My Firehouse Burger was very good, with nicely saut\u00e9ed/grilled onions and peppers.  Half pound of ground beef was truly pink at its core, and proved a challenge to consume despite its excellent juicy profile.  The baked beans were also solidly flavorful, but could have used a few chunks of burnt ends or pulled pork in the mix to max out the texture and provide more twang. \n\nThe dining room was small, but comfortable, with Texas collectibles hanging for ceiling and wall. I would return to try the ribs or another burger, but not before I visited other nearby grillmasters to check out their goods.  I wasn't blown away by Fat Jack's, but neither was I repelled by their chuck wagon grub.",

To be kind, it is not exactly the sweetest spot in the capital city to find an eating house, let alone one that had been there for 26 years under the same ownership.  Still, there is a reason it has survived, and maybe even prospered over time.  \n\nThere is room for eating in, even though the vast majority of customers order to take out. The man in charge is warm and humorous, and his very ancient looking Confucian beard has turned white. When I asked for his recommendation for lunch, he promptly said the Chicken in Garlic Sauce was the way to go.  Who was I to disagree? \n\nThe plate arrived about 10 minutes later.  It was styro, but at least it wasn't served in a to go box.  It was accompanied with brown rice, and an egg roll, and too thin napkins.  There were ample strips of chicken and plenty of pepper, onion, carrot, pea pod, mushroom, water chestnut and baby corn.  The garlic sauce was noticeable, but not overpowering.  I liked the dish.  Even the egg roll was tasty, without oily aftertaste.  \n\nWhile this was far from the best Chinese food I'd ever eaten, it was also far from the worst.  At $5.35 for the who shebang, plus another buck for a bottle of water, I thought it was a good deal.  It was also obvious that they don't feel the need to keep the joint sparkling.  It was pretty gritty. \n\n  As I paid and walked out, I understood how Number One had survived so long.  A smile and low price still goes a long way.",

Skulls everywhere.  Plenty of booths in the three dining areas to feel comfortable.  Acoustics were trouble, as every sound was amplified by all the hard and harmonic surfaces.  Pleasant service. \n\nWe ordered pretty standard fare.  A beef burrito for son. Chicken flautas for the old man.  Shrimp Molcajete for stepson.  Chips & salsa as forespice. Everything was okay, but not memorable.  The burrito was stuffed with mildly spiced shredded cow, cheese and peppers.  My son drowned it in the available salsa to bring up the burn.  He ate every last shred, but announced it wasn't very different than what he had recently at Taco Belch.  My fried chicken, cheese and spice stuffed flutes were fine. It was an appetizer, but enough for me last night. Crisp shell. Decent bird mix. The molcajete was basically their version of fajitas - served in a hot volcanic rock, with only six medium sized shrimp and a load of saut\u00e9ed colorful peppers and onions.  Small sides of black beans, rice, guacamole and sour cream.  He wolfed down the crustaceans and played with the veggies before declaring himself full (bored).  At $15., it was more floor show, than gut filling meal. \n\nWe left agreeing that the joint had potential, but that the food wasn't its strength.  Too young to partake of the bar offerings, we suspected that all the tequila on display might offer a clue to where the magic lies in El Barrio Cantina & Tequila Bar.  \n\nNext time I'll come with grownups and sample their tequila flight and margaritas.",

    "text": "La Hacienda (Home), is a very colorful Mexican restaurant on Neshaminy Boulevard behind Neshaminy Mall.  As with similar spots, the furnishings are wood carved tables and chairs that are brightly painted to suggest an eating establishment South of the Border.  It is successful in creating that atmosphere, and the servers are friendly and attentive, while speaking in heavily accented (but totally understandable) English.  While quite stimulating, I admit to seldom eating in such loudly decorated places in Mexico, where even the high end places tend to be more sedate.  Still, it does make for an unusual and stimulating environment.\n\nUltimately, it all comes down to the food.  Eating solo, I could only taste what I ordered, and my fork had no place to wander into a companion's plate.  The ubiquitous Chips and Salsa were fine, although the Chips did not have an in house made taste.  The Salsa was of the thin variety, but sufficiently spicy to catch my enjoyable attention.  \n \nMy main course was Chicken Adobe - a grilled pounded thin Chicken Breast covered with Grilled Japapenos, Onions, Mushrooms, and Melted White Cheese.  The rest of the large plate was covered in Refried Beans and Yellow Rice (see photo).  I rather liked the Chicken and savory toppings.  The grilling was flavorful and texturally pronounced, and the accompaniment was translucent and very complementary in spice tones.  The Refried Beans were loose enough to spread across the plate lowlands, and could have either been reduced in quantity or given more body.  The Rice was just okay, and a rather large portion.  \n\nThis is certainly a decent place for a Mexican style meal, and I would return if hankering for Mexicano when in that part of the County.  Yet, given several of the other awesomely authentic and delicious meals I have had the pleasure to encounter recently in my travels nearby, where the joint was fairly plain, but the comidas outstanding, I would not choose La Hacienda when I want an exceptional 4 or 5 Star Mexican experience.",

    "text": "In order to apply for a Pennsylvania Driver Permit, not only do you need to show a social security card, but the form also has a portion for a doctor's physical and certification that the applicant is healthy enough to drive.  This is probably a good idea, but it does add to the time and expense of driving in the Commonwealth.  My family doctor was willing, but the available appointment was a week away and the office visit charge was not insignificant.  \n\nSo, I decided to call Premier Urgent Care in Newtown to see if they could handle this type of service.  They could and they did.  We could walk in any time during business hours and the cost would be $45 (apparently, there are sometimes special discounts to $25).  We went in the following morning.  The facility was bright and clean.  The employees were all dressed in high end med uniforms, and efficient.  We registered after filling out a 2 page form, and were seen by a medical assistant promptly.  She took us into an examination room, did the basis BP, pulse, height, weight, and eyesight measurements and tests, and then left us to wait for the doctor to finish the exam.  \n\nIt took about 20 minutes for Dr. Ferguson to arrive.  She was friendly and communicated well.  We went over the pertinent details of why we were there, and she completed he portion of the physical with quick looks at eyes, ears and throat.  She was quite professional.  \n\nApparently, my young driving applicant was deemed healthy enough to get behind the wheel of a motorized vehicle, and we were sent on our way.  \n\nOverall, the experience was satisfactory for this type of medical function.  No emergency to deal with.  Just routine physical examination.  While lacking the sense of confidence I have with my personal physician, such \"hand holding\" wasn't necessary for this job.  We were out in about 40 minutes and had what we needed.  \n\nI would certainly use Premier Urgent Care again for simple medical needs.  It is sort of like going to Wawa when you want coffee and a sandwich, and don't have time for the bigger deli/restaurant experience.",

Yet, blessed with sight, the worn and crumby surfaces and poor condition of the shopping center where it is located, impact my overall impression negatively and detract from what would otherwise be a surprisingly good meal. \n\nMy first choice for dinner was the place next door, but its kitchen closed at 3 and they were locking up shortly. I saw Dulce and headed over. It looked like any other pizzeria, with pies in the oven and a small dining room with tubular chairs with holes in the seats and crumbs from earlier meals still laying around. This joint would never be mistaken for clean. It somehow reflected the poorly maintained condition of the shopping center, which had some of the largest parking lot potholes imaginable. A few customers were sitting around manging, so I took a chance and asked for an eggplant parmesan dinner with side salad and pasta. I ordered and paid at the cashier and took a seat near the front window to await it's arrival. I wasn't feeling too enthused about what might be coming my way, but I had already paid, so I was committed. \n\nThe salad came first with balsamic, romaine, tomato, red onion, black olives, cukes and that little plastic tub of dark brown viniagrette. It was cool and fresh. Not great, but not bad. The main platter arrived next with a red sauce covered load of very thin sliced, breaded and sauteed melanzone. The gravy was chunky and seemed to shine in the natural light from the window. I lowered my head to get a wiff of the steaming sauce. Its crushed tomato, garlic and basil aroma forced me back in my chair from its powerful scent. \n\nWhat?! Wait a second. Was there someone in the kitchen who knew from red sauce? Must have been because when I forked that first bite into my mouth, it completely took charge of my taste buds, squeezed them hard, and forced me to involuntarily mutter, \"Damn!\" It was that exceptional. The eggplant was soft and totally baked, without a hard spot to be found. It tasted like it might have been sauteed twice before reaching the oven. \n\nThen I tried the penne aglio olio I had requested rather than spaghetti with more red. It was also very good with a surfeit of sliced garlic throughout and a pool of extra virgin in the bottom of the bowl keeping it hot and dripping. A dusting of black pepper, romano and dried parsley on top provided the finishing note. Also, way better than expected. \n\nOf course they forgot the bread to complete my total confounding. \n\nWhat to do when the grub is better than good, but the facility and surroundings cry out for some TLC?\n\n Wear a blindfold and eat.",

The dining room reminds of an adobe bright colored house in New Mexico, with semi-exposed timbers and ersatz red tile roof extending from the inner walls. \n\nThe staff is friendly and attractive and provide a solid table service.  \n\nA couple of the office guys went there for a pizza lunch the other day.  We ordered a 12 inch pie with sausage and eggplant for two of us.  It was prepared fresh for us, and took about 15 minutes to reach our table.  It looked quite good with the steam rising from the bubbling volcanic cheese surface.  The aroma was exquisite. \n\nWe knew that this was a Spanish (Ecuadorian) Italian shop, but the menu remained heavy oriented toward Italiano.  This may explain the over-reliance on cheese, rather than tomato sauce and spices to define the pie.  The abundance of melted mozza made the pizza top heavy, and impossible to pick up manually, without fold and spillage.  This is often the mistake of pizza makers unschooled in the ways of the tomato pie, where proper proportion among the main ingredients is critical to the success of the creation.  \n\nThe taste was still good, but we both resorted to fork and knife in order to keep the various layers together.  It was one of those circumstances when less (cheese) is more satisfying. \n\nWhile I likely will not order pizza again from Trentini's, the rest of their menu, and the quality of service will lead me back there eventually to sample their other offerings, both in pasta and almuertzo Americano del Sur.",

It was nice to have a head start on what was to be a full house at Full Moon.  \n\nClayton, our host and server had his act together and brought all of us coffee as we perused the breakfast menu.  Various omelets for my family and friend, and French Toast for me.  While the conversation gathered momentum, the plates were brought out and laid before us.  Everything looked very good, although I only tasted the homemade Potato Chips, which were good.\n\nMy French Toast was off the mark, however. I had asked for it \"crunchy,\" and was told it would be left on the grill longer to make it all well done.  What came out with the real Maple Syrup were a half dozen pieces of French Demi Loaf that were actually lukewarm at best, and far from the cauterized ends I requested.  I was surprised given the repartee at the ordering.  They had not been on the grill long enough, and had been off the grill too long before serving. Wrong on both sides.  Disappointing, but not wanting to poop on the party I ate everything and enjoyed the real Maple Syrup. \n\nMy mates were satisfied, and the gestalt of the room was pleasing. \n\nThree out of four ain't bad.",

This facility is fairly new with lots of stone, high ceilings and wooden tables and chairs. Small parking lot is a challenge. The menu is primarily pizza parlor style - pies, steak sandwiches, wraps, salads. There are only a few actual dinner options. Chicken parmesan and a few pastas with meatballs or sausage. \n\nWe went with the chicken parmesan, which came with a nice size salad and bowl of pasta, \"Rustic\" chicken cheesesteak, and their BBQ burger. Of the three dishes, the burger was actually the best. Juicy, substantial and tasting without freezer burn. The rustic roll was a good alternative to the standard torpedo, but the makings were a bit dry and needed more flavor from the onions and peppers. The chicken parmesan was okay, but heavily breaded. The salad was bigger than expected and enough to share. The homemade fettuccine aglio olio was was real al dente delight. \n\nPat's provides nice atmosphere, but the kitchen could be more consistent. It has its highs and lows. It is certainly worth a stop to check out when in the mood to be in the mood for Italian food.",

Someone has to keep watch of the state of slice around here. It may as well be me. N'cest pas?\n\nNo one there when I arrived around 2.  The shop was clean and orderly.  The crew in back was friendly and accommodating to my request for 2 slices and cold drink (lemonade). They came out of the reheat oven in about 3 minutes and I sprinkled on the crushed hot pepper as I walked to my table.  The price was right @ under $6. A full two bucks less than Marco's for the same deal. \n\nHow were the slices?  I forgot my scale, but they did seem smaller than a similar cut in the other places I often go, perhaps offsetting the economy of slice noted above.  Still, the crust was thin and crisp, and held the weight of the sauce and cheese well.  No folding nor dripping. Big plus. The taste is where the rubber meets the road, and to my buds the oral sensations were not quite right.  The sauce was a little salty, when I prefer a mild sweetness and basil-esque retort. The cheese had little flavor and did not play well with the sauce. \n\nI am not saying that the pizza was bad, just that it wasn't a complete pleasure, nor did it stand tall next to the local competition.\n\n It was just A - OK.",

That is a life time in pizza years. \nAfter today's basketball game in Churchville, we stopped in for a few slices and drinks to assuage the pain of another close loss.  \nThe pizza was as good as I remembered it.  Strong enough dough to hold its point proudly without folding like a dog's ear; minimal drip of oil from the face of the pie; and a serenely enjoyable first bite experience.  My son's first impression was equally positive.  His comment to the effect that it was not quite as good as Marco's in Newtown was well taken and subject to debate.  Regardless, Giuseppe's is in good company.\nWe will need to explore the menu further by venturing into cheese steaks, parms, and pasta to consider moving up the star ranks.",

This is a growing Asian neighborhood that is slowly becoming a legitimate alternative to Chinatown (Center City) and Washington Avenue (South Philly) for your dining and shopping pleasure. \n\nClientele is primarily Chinese, as is the staff. Cantonese is understood more readily than Mandarin. The menu is bilingual, with major focus on the beef/pork soup food group. Plenty of dumpling options, too, from Xiao Long Bao to wok fried pork gaozi. I was there for the XLB, so ordered two steam baskets (12) of them and a large bowl of Magic Noodles 101 (beef and bones in savory broth with mix of mushrooms and black fungus). \n\nThe Shanghai created XLB were steamy and quite tasty with a touch of vinegar dropped in through the opened top knot for added flavor. Only downside was that the skin was so friable that the act of lifting them gently onto my spoon with the metal tongs cause them to tear, leaving a leaking dough sack to contend with. Every one of them tore open. Nimble handling to place them quickly into the spoon was the only way to salvage the contents. I managed to do that, but still had to suck some soup from the spoon each time. \n\nThe Magic Noodle bowl was okay, but I found gnawing  the beef bones to be messy and less than fun. The mushrooms were flavorful and I knew the fungus was good for health. \n\nThis was a very tactile meal. It was definitely a change of pace cultural experience that was as entertaining as it was nourishing.",

    "text": "COVID-19 TAKE OUT REVIEW\n\nSpice Garden is a take away only Indian kitchen that focuses on Kerala style South Indian cuisine. It didn't have to change much of its operation to adjust to the pandemic. On the end of an old commercial strip near the bottom of Bustleton Avenue just a few blocks before Grant Avenue, it is designed to accept your phone order for pick up 30 - 40 minutes later. That was our plan after grocery shopping at the large Asian supermarket on St. Vincent's Street @ Roosevelt Avenue. We called from the parking lot, arriving about 15 minutes later because of light Memorial Day Weekend traffic.\n\nNow, I've had much better curries, masalas and garlic naans than are offered at Spice Garden, but on the other hand there is a trade-off of larger quantities and cheaper prices than available at standard Hindi houses, although the online menu states that recent cost of ingredient increases necessitated higher prices. That's just reality given these harsh times, and we didn't object to absorbing a couple of more bucks. \n\nOf course, by the time we reached home the blush was off the rose. Reheating was required to reanimated each dish. We found each was tasty and very well spiced. The two chicken plates led the way, with the Kerala Chicken Curry in a dark thick sauce and the Chicken Pepper Fry bone in and the hottest of the lot. It was a finger food delight. The Channa Masala was lighter cream colored mildly sweet veggie dish that was a good sop for the Garlic Naan. The other diced mixed veggie bowl was a strong counterpoint to the rest of the tongue challenging heat packed into the two plastic take home bags.\n\nThe only real downside to the experience was the cleanliness of the small anteroom when I waited for the food. There were several insulated containers sitting on the floor, each more schmutzidick than the other. Clearly used for moving cooked food, there was no way they would pass a health department inspection. They left me wondering about the condition of the kitchen on the other side of that swinging door. \n\nI'll let you know if I experience any side effects from this meal, which appears to be enough for three dinners.",

    "text": "While KO Modern Korean Cuisine does a tasty new take on traditional dishes from the peninsula, you must keep in mind that they call themselves a fusion restaurant that covers Japanese, Thai and even a pinch of Chinese in their kitchen. If traditional is what you want, then this is not the place for you. Try Mirim or the cafe inside of H Mart on Woodbourne Road for the real McCoy. It is only fair to judge based on their stated intentions, not on what they do not claim to be. \n\nTo my tongue they do a very good job on creative contemporary Korean food. I thoroughly enjoyed the small plate KFC (Korean Fried Chicken) and BBQ Pork Belly Bao. The extra spicy wings were just that. Messy and delicious. The Buns a tempting pile of belly and greens atop a soft round pinchable white rice bun. Had I stopped there I would have been seeing multi stars. \n\nThe Sushi and Bento Dinner from the Japan side of the menu were a different matter. Our Rainbow Roll ordered for a sushi neophyte, was less than inspiring. It appeared lifeless on the platter, and tasted less than brand new. When sushi is truly fresh, it has an inner glow. This did not. Perhaps, the use of dyed pink ginger was a tell, but it was less than optimal. I would like to see what they do with Gimbap, the seaweed and rice street food that most closely resembles sushi. I suspect it would have been superior. \n\nThe Bento options chosen were teriyaki salmon,  Dynamite Chicken and a similar shrimp offering (tiny deep fried crustaceans in a gloopy sticky sweet sauce). Again, this Japanese combo plate missed the mark. The salmon was good, but slightly overcooked. The chicken was barely above room temperature, and the shrimp was lost in the heavy batter shell and thick clingy sauce. Just not what we expected from this kitchen. \n\nWe agreed we would try again, but focus only on the Korean possibilities. This night, fusion could only be interpreted as confusion.",

    "text": "TAKEOUT REVIEW \nCurious about this primarily take away Italian fast casual shop in Levittown, PA, I drove down late last week to pick up a light family dinner. I ordered three sandwiches; roast pork, chicken cheesesteak and sweet sausage, onions and peppers. \n\nThey were packaged in white, rectangular cardboard boxes and each half wrapped in butcher paper before being placed in a plastic bag before handing to me through the drive thru window. About $17 for the three. Good deal. Problem was that the placement of the boxes in the bag was haphazard. Once home and removing them from the sack and putting them on our kitchen table, it was obvious the boxes were not bagged upright, but on their sides. As a result, their was leakage and the roast pork a sloppy mess. \n\nI did my best to reconstruct the sammy, and placed all three in the oven for a quick reheat. They were still tasty, although the rolls were damp and not first quality. The roast pork was juicy, the sausage had nice texture and plenty of flavor. The steak 'wich was only so-so. \n\nI try to avoid take out most of the time because so much is lost not eating food right after it is off the grill. Zio Gio was no different. If I lived nearby, it is good enough to be in the be in rotation for a pizza/sandwich stop. Given the distance, it is unlikely to happen. There are too many local restos deserving our business.",

My third post-vaccine meal in a restaurant as the world crawls out of its collective cave to taste life again. \n\nThe Vegetarian Omelet was a substantial plate load of 3 eggs, broccoli, onion, mushroom and spinach, with a shovel full of home fried potatoes for balance and good measure. Rye toast was a crunch and a half. Very filling, but required extra black pepper for taste on both the eggs and taters. \n\nI was surprised and concerned that the server was not masked, when we were required to be, and the owner was covered as well. Even with two jabs I would have felt more secure had she considered the reality that she was in contact with everyone in the dining room and kitchen and close proximity with every customers' food.  There is something to be said for keeping up appearances, especially in a food service business. \n\nMaybe management will see this review and reevaluate its policy on proper social distancing protocols even in the improving circumstance of an almost safe, nearly post Covid world.",

    "text": "Can't say I was impressed with this Iron Hill Brewery in Abington, PA. \n\nWhile the Pumpkin Ale was tasty and refreshing, our menu choices were fair to middling at best. We ordered their Calamari appetizer, Asian Salmon Burger and Country Schnitzel as main courses. The Calamari was all small rings (no tentacles) and overly oily from deep frying. Our guess was that these little things came from a large bag of frozen seafood. Nice to have slivers of hot peppers mixed in, but the ranch dressing dip really didn't contribute to the experience. \n\nMy dining mate didn't offer a taste of the Asian Salmon after she took a bite and put it aside. \"Too much garlic,\" she explained. Those fries were quite crisp and crunchified, however, and I had a free hand with them. \n\nThe pork fillet Schnitzel was good; nice breading, pan fried with chunky Andouille Sausage white gravy over top. We ended up sharing that after she turned aside her salmon. I found the cutlets to be better without the gravy, and was able to push most of it off the entree. The sides (fresh spinach saut\u00e9ed in garlic and oil, and the mashed sweet potato) were very colorful and also tasty strong contributors. Fair to say this plate was our dinner's salvation. \n\nThe space felt somewhat worn out. I don't like carpeted dining rooms, as they tend to hide the accumulated dirt that collects in the fibers. This wall to wall definitely had been down too long. \n\nThis was my third Iron Hill in the past month. Overall, unless very new, these breweries just don't seem to maintain high class facilities and appear worse for wear compared to their competition.\n\nThree STARS is as far as I can go.",

    "text": "Hidden in the front corner of H Mart in Levittown, PA, lies Manna Kitchen, a tiny Korean restaurant serving cuisine from the homeland and China at reasonable prices. There are only four tables, so takeout is the primary focus. I stopped in yesterday to check out their Korean Fried Chicken, which comes six pieces to the container for nine bucks and change. \n\nTo be transparent, we seemed to have a small miscommunication about exactly what I was getting. I asked for Korean Fried Chicken Wings, which I thought the friendly order taker agreed I could have. Instead, what I got were a few wings and a majority of thighs. Now, I like thighs, but they are not the same as wings in taste nor texture. So, when I arrived home my first impression was that I had received huge wings. First bite told the tale, and disappointed my taste buds. The crisp was there, as was the delicious ginger soy finish, but the taste of the dark meat chicken could not be mistaken. \n\nI am willing to chalk this confusion up to poor ordering on my part, rather than intentional misdirection by the staff. I did enjoy them once I realized what I had, it's just that my expectations were left unmet. This accounts for the loss of a star. After all, meeting expectations is what satisfaction is all about, and thus, reviews reflect that reality. \n\nStill, I will get back to Manna sooner or later to see what else is going on. I do hope for no more misunderstandings, and that the chef is wearing her mask at all times while handling food, which accounts for the second demerit.",

It has been frying up Chet's secret recipe for several decades.  Recently, the original chicken shack has been taken over by Pakistanis and added an identity of Shan Halal Pakistani, Indian & Bengali Cuisine.  The Southern Fried Chicken is still produced, but now there is a full South Asian menu complete from Masalas and Kormas, to Curry, Gosht and Naan.  \n\nThe owner and chef is a devout Muslim, meaning he is friendly, courteous, modest, and accommodating. He was patient with me as I figured out what was being offered in these otherwise widely desperate culinary approaches.  I had not experienced a Fried Chicken/Chicken Masala house before.  But, I was game.\n\nI wasn't completely ready to mix the two in one meal, and did not want to siesta after eating, so opted to go with Chester's grub.  I ordered the Special that included a Breast, Wing, 2 Jo-Jos (potato wedges) and a Roll.  At $3.99, I thought I had stepped into a time warp.  Turned out that the Chicken was quite good.  The coating was light and pleasantly spiced, without the oiliness that so often comes as part of the dish.  It was crispy from the deep fryer, but the layer of breading was so thin compared to what is found in the name brand competitors, that I appreciated why Chester had been so successful.  The Jo-Jos were also coated and fried, but were still just a close variant to what everyone offers.  The Roll was wasted calories from a store bakery.  \n\nNext visit I will explore the rest of the menu and file an update.  For the moment, Chester's Fried Chicken moves to the head of the class for a well designed and executed icon of country American dishes.  I would certainly pick some up for a family dinner.  To get the freshest and best tasting chicken, I will call ahead and ask for a fresh order to be prepared.",

    "text": "Phi Vietnamese opened its doors three weeks ago in the Crossroads Shopping Center off Rt. 313 in Doylestown.  It is the first shop to offer primarily Vietnamese food in the area, and for that they are worthy of appreciation.  Welcome to the hood.\n\nThe store is nicely appointed with black tables and chairs and burnt orange painted walls.  Looks good.  The staff is mostly indigenous to VN, and are quite attentive to their customers.  The menu offers what would be expected from this ethnic kitchen - Pho, Broken Rice, Summer Rolls, etc., at price points that while higher than in their siblings in less upscale environs, reflect the rent structure of the area.  $10 may be more than we are accustomed to paying for a large bowl of noodle soup, but it is a fact of life that things cost more in better communities.  \n\nSon and I stopped in for Pho Ga (Chicken Pho) and Bun Bo Hue (Beef Noodle Soup from the former royal capital of Hue in Central VN).  Service was fast, although belied by slower delivery of the side plate of Thai Basil, Jalapeno Slices, Sprouts and Lime Wedges.  They also forget to bring the Hoisin and Sriracha Sauces for customization.  No biggie. I went to get them myself. \n\nThe Chicken Pho was basic, but a solid presentation. It was steaming hot, with enough sliced white meat to keep son satisfied.  The Bun Bo Hue was another matter.  The spicing was off.  When right, it has a balance of Lemongrass, Fermented Shrimp Sauce, Chili Pepper and Sugar, to represent the major spice groups.  When joined with the amply simmered Beef Broth, and loads of thin sliced steak and brisket, it becomes a powerful combination that attacks the eyes, nose and mouth at the same time.  It can literally take your breath away until you adjust to its flavors and begin to taste how great they are together.  Phi's version was unbalanced with weak Lemongrass presence, and no sweet undertone.  Too, the table lacked the Vietnamese Coriander that adds to the complexity.  While it was hot and possessed some kick, it could not duplicate the burst of flavors a true BBH puts out.  \n\nPhi Vietnamese is certainly good enough for a second visit and hopefully they will get their spice legs beneath them and start to BRING IT!  They shouldn't underestimate the sophistication of the local pallets, or they risk losing face to the suburban houses that can do it right, like House of Pho in Southampton and Pho Palace in Feasterville.",

It claims to fame are its fried chicken, wings, burgers and hot dogs. As I was a rookie there, and it was late lunch time, I decided to try a few things - Jumbo's fried chicken, two types of wings and my most secret curiosity, the hot dog. \n\nI ordered the 4 piece Fried Chicken (white meat, no sides), Spicy Sweet and Hot Fire Wings and the Elote Hot Dog. The exchange took place at the walk up drive thru window with the friendly woman I took to be an owner/manager. Everything was prepared in about 20 minutes, and she brought a neat package out to me as I waited in the car. \n\nIn no particular order - \n\nThe Elote Hot Dog was very good. The beef sausage was firm, fresh and loaded with garlicy flavor in a quality bun. The Mexican corn had plenty of spice and interesting taste, that although wet did not harm the strength of the bun. The Elote drizzle over the top was a bit salty, but not enough to be a distraction. Love me a great frankfurter, and this was almost that. \n\nThe Fried Chicken had lost its crispness by the time it reached my kitchen table. Probably inevitable, but still not at its apex. The flavor of the fried surface was milder than I like, and it needed more zest. The chicken itself was tender, but the lack of spice in each chew made the overall experience less than hoped. It just wasn't memorable. \n\nThe wings were a medium size. The Spicy Sweet was a decent sauce that was more sweet than spicy. The Fire Hot was a rub finish that had the right amount of burn. They compared favorably with the equivalents at Buffalo Wild Wings according to our sons.\n\nWill have to return for the burgers and tots, but until then, 3 Stars is where it's at.",

    "text": "The facility is very nice with dark wood tones and adequate spacing of tables.  The sushi area is to the side and kept very clean.  The service is adequate, if not overly warm or informative.  Definitely, a nice space to eat and socialize.\n\nThe Hibachi is not much to my liking, as whether beef, chicken, shrimp or lobster, they all taste almost the same coming off the grill due to the heavy dosing with soy sauce.  The flipping of food morsels from the spatula into the diners mouth is funny the first dozen or so times it is experienced, but gets old (and messy) after a while.  This is not the place I would chose to have a delicious steak, as it is far from a Ruth Chris, Capitol Grille, or Walensky's experience.  \n\nThe rest of the menu is diverse and generally decent, but not outstanding enough to want to return more than sporadically.  The presentation is done well, and the staff is prompt if not overly engaging with the customers.   I have tried the Udon/Soba Noodles with Chicken or Beef and enjoyed them, although they were less spicy that I generally prefer.  The Bento Boxes and lunch are a solid meal with Shumai, Tempura Veggies, and Haru Maki or other light roll as accompaniment. \n\nFor me, Mt. Fuji is a good alternative place for local lunch or dinner, but I would not drive far out of my way for the opportunity.  Thus, 3 Stars.",

You can also order a full ham. This one is in the Village of Newtown section anchored by the Pier 1 store. \n\nThe few times I have been there I have gone with Turkey Breast, Swiss Cheese with lettuce and mustard, Cole Slaw side, Snapple Ice Tea and a Peanut Butter Cookie. It comes in a cute box.  They taste good, if not outstanding.  The service has been friendly, but when I am there it seems the owner is there alone and doing all the work.  This makes for a feeling that he is rushing around, for which he has my sympathy.  \n\nI have also been a regular of another HBH in the Mercer Mall in Lawrenceville, New Jersey.

    "text": "Went in for a late lunch last Saturday after a grocery haul at 1st Oriental down the street.  The floor plan looked like many other Vietnamese houses, with an open space occupied by long tables for group dining.  Turns out that I.S. BBQ is run by Chinese folk with a large menu covering several Asian food groups, as well as their signature Hot Pot/Smokeless BBQ grill in the middle of every table.  I wasn't hungry enough for an AYCE meat meal, so went with a few of the small plates - Spring Rolls, BBQ Beef & Lemongrass with Rice, and a bowl of Pho with Lean Steak and Meatballs. \n\nService was prompt, but made the mistake of bringing the main courses before the app.  No biggie, but knew someone wasn't being attentive. The Rolls were very good.  Crispy, mildly oily from cooking, but loaded with Pork, Shrimp and Cabbage filler. Nice side of White Radish. The accompanying thin sweet sauce was fine.  Likewise, the beef dish was plentiful and tasty.  The Rice was molded into a plateaued mound, and in great condition to absorb the mix of sauces on the plate. \n\nThe only real shortcoming was with the Pho.  While the broth was decent, the beef was way overcooked and tough to chew.  It had been pre-cooked, and not left to simmer in the soup to reach the right doneness in the bowl. Given all the raw meat available for the Hot Pot, the failure to simply slip a few slices into the bowl was incomprehensible.  Too, the accoutrement lacked Jalapeno slices to bring up the burn.  Disappointing.\n\nWhile I might consider a return for the Hot Pot or BBQ, the attractiveness of the overall joint was significantly dampened by the Pho Phail.",

    "text": "This was a first visit to Lee's Caf\u00e9 and Bistro at the corner of 5th and Washington in South Philly.  The green awnings are inviting in this otherwise standalone renovated old house that sits in front of the 1st Oriental Super Market on that same block.  \n\nIt is not until you get to the front doors that you learn that the actual caf\u00e9 is on the second floor, while the first is occupied by their caf\u00e9 displays where you can get java and bakery goods to go, or bring upstairs.  The dining space is very clean for a restaurant in this area, and the furnishings a step above the utilitarian space found nearby in Pho Ha.  The walls are brightly painted and HDTVs hang from the walls.  The menu is fairly typical for a Saigon house, but the servers are definitely more friendly and engaging than in most other Vietnamese joints.  \n\nWe ordered Summer Rolls, Pho Tai and BBQ Pork Banh Mi, and recognized quickly that the prices were higher here than in the rest of the neighborhood.  It must reflect the cost of the recent renovations.  We hoped that the quality of the kitchen was likewise reflected in the pricing.  \n\nThis was not really the case.  The Summer Rolls were cool and fresh, with thin sliced shrimp attracting the most attention through the opaque skin, but also stuffed with Pork and Cabbage.  The Peanut Sauce was a bit on the thin side and lacked any ground peanuts to supplement the textural experience.  The Pho was only average in terms of the beef broth.  Plenty of Sprouts, Thai Basil, Jalapenos and Lime Wedges, and a veritable bird's nest of rice noodles beneath the surface, but lacking the subtleties of the finer pho venues.  In point of comparison, Pho Ha, right around the corner and visible from there has far superior slurp for the demanding consumer.  \n\nThe Banh Mi was fine - fresh and crunchy with ample BBQ Pork, Daikon, Carrot, Mayo and Cilantro.  But, the roll it came in was neither baguette, nor Italian, but some crumbly hybrid that although fresh, lacked the body of the real contender.  It wasn't fun to bite through and chew.  And, the cost at nearly $8. was far in excess of strong alternatives found nearby for under $5. \n\nSo, net/net, Lee's is a nice place to hang out and grab a bite in relative comfort while looking out the second story windows, but if outstanding cuisine is what you came for, you might find yourself underwhelmed.  With so many exceptional Vietnamese shops in the immediate vicinity, I found myself thinking of them rather than enjoying where I was.",

    "text": "Olive Garden \"Italian\" Restaurant is one of those places designed for compromise.  In my case, it was a reasonable place to go with family given the limitations of each member.  My son loves cheese, but hates veggies, and said he was not very hungry.  His mother (my ex) is a vegetarian who loves the unlimited Salad and Breadstick deal offered by the chain.  Me?  I love Italian cuisine, but also want to keep the peace and make it through a Mother's Day dinner without stress.  Given all the variables, Olive Garden was the obvious choice.  \n\nSurprisingly, the wait was not long when we arrived around 7:30.  We were seated within 10 minutes and our server was on us quickly for our drink and app requests. They arrived promptly, along with the first bowl of Salad without olives nor croutons, but with extra Red Onion, Tomato and Cheese.  I didn't know the salad could be special ordered, but it was a good idea.  The veggies were freshly cut and the Oil and Vinegar dressing was decent.  The Bread Sticks were hot and a little crispy on the bottom, which I liked.  \n\nI was the only one having an actual dinner, having skipped lunch, and went with the new light Garlic Rosemary Chicken.  It arrived with two smallish chicken breasts well grilled, but without any grill marks, on a bed of Fresh Spinach, a few Caramelized Garlic Cloves (needed more), and a nice plop of Garlic Mashed Potatoes.  The Rosemary was not visible, but the chicken did taste of it.  \n\nOverall, I was satisfied with the meal, although the sauce was thin and a bit salty.  For a \"light\" meal it was filling.  At $13.99 it seemed a reasonable value.  Would I order the same dish again?  Probably not, as the trade off in flavor for the lack of calories was not a winning hand.  It could be that I am comparing my experiences in many more authentic Italian restos, but I did not feel excited by the meal.  It was adequate.   \n\nAs no one complained and we were able to have a low key dinner, Olive Garden did its job, and met my decidedly selfish expectations.",

It is clean, utilitarian and somewhat stylish with a \"lounge\" along the front window for those who prefer to recline while eating.  The menu is posted high on the wall and takes a bit of scouting to figure out what is going on.  Luckily, I was the only customer when I arrived, and the good gentleman behind the counter came around to explain the system to me.  \n\nI had read about the Flight of Empanadas - three delicately wrapped fillings surrounded by Argentine imported dough that fries up light, crisp, airy an very tasty.  The inside are Ham & Cheese, Pulled Pork, and fine textured Beef/Gravy thing; each in a distinctly shaped enclosure.  They were a curiosity and fun to eat, with interesting textures, but lacking in any signature flavors.  They were all bland, leaving the outer shell as the most memorable part of the dish.  Perhaps, that was the point. \n\nThe Crispy Fried Chicken Panino was beautifully presented on oversized Sour Dough, with strips of Fried Chicken, an Aioli based Mayo, Tomato, Lettuce and American Cheese.  It was a handful.  I liked the bite, chew and taste of this sandwich, but later that night found myself suffering heartburn, possibly from the mayo or some aspect of the sauces within each empanada.  As it was the last meal of the day, this meal was the likely culprit. \n\nNonetheless, the house is pleasantly open and airy, and the staff very helpful and friendly.  I appreciate its uniqueness.  \n\nStill, I have no strong desire to return for another taste, and that implies that I am not yet a fan, and can't reach 4 stars.",

Otherwise, it is the same as it ever was, except for the need to go to a different website to buy advance tickets.  \n\nWhat has become obvious is that the cinema business has taken a page from the sports complex business model.  Your ticket may seem expensive, but only until you step up to the snack bar cashier to order the pop corn, candy, pizza, chicken fingers, soda pop, and other sundries.  Those prices quickly double or triple your price of admission.  Outrageous. \n\nSo, most people find a way to bring in food and drink surreptitiously to avoid being gouged.  No wonder ticket sales are down annually and the movie theaters chains are shedding underperforming assets in an attempt to find a profit.  It would seem that the better way to go is to get a liquor license and set up a decent kitchen and make \"dinner and a movie,\" into a unique one stop experience.  \n\nHopefully, a more creative approach will save this icon of American culture.  After all, there are some movies that just have to be enjoyed on a huge screen in a dark auditorium, with your arm around your babe's shoulders.",

    "text": "I've picked up food from JC Teriyaki two days in a row to try a few of their main dishes to see what was happening there.  I've eaten their Fried Chicken and Hibachi Chicken, along with sides of Lima Beans, Potato Salad, Corn Bread and the Cabbage/Carrots combo that comes with the Hibachi offerings.  \n\nJCT sits on Parkside Avenue just north of Olden Avenue Extension in a somewhat rundown retail strip center which also has a Chinese takeout joint and an Italian pizzeria. Nice to have options. \n\nWhile I enjoyed the entertainment of watching these three guys preparing the food, the actual finished products were only average.  The Fried Chicken combo of breast and wing was nicely meaty and never frozen, however the coating did not have very much flavor compared to the standards we all know.  It lacked sufficient spices to really stand out.  The white meat was plump and juicy and would have really shined with the right flour mix.  The accompanying Potato Salad was nicely sweet, but the Lima Beans were supersized and mushy.  The Corn Bread was pretty good. \n\nThe Hibachi Chicken order was large and with the Veggies really weighed down the container.  It was cut into small strips and doused well with Hibachi Sauce throughout grilling.  It was interesting to see the American short order grill used for a Japanese dish.  I had not thought of that before, but it was cool to put those two cultural icons together. The chicken was tender and had a nice flavor.  The veggies of Steamed Cabbage and Carrots were a little boring; lacking much taste.  \n\nJC Teriyaki is a mixed bag.  I like the concept demonstrating the cross-cultural bonds between Southern American cooking and Japanese grilling, but had higher expectations for the actual results.  Perhaps, the pricing of the meals (quite low) interferes with the ability to really pull out the stops and make the meals memorable. \n\n3.5 Stars is probably the right place to be here, but I want to encourage an upgrade in performance quality which won't happen without a little mild criticism.",

    "text": "The same shop as the former Food Castle, this north Indian restaurant offers a menu of both Indian and Chinese cuisine.  They are on opposite sides of the take out menu, and no Chinese dishes were available in the luncheon buffet.  I have heard a lot about the Indo-Sino kitchens, but have yet to actually try it.  It is not clear that New Moghul cooks that way, but when I was there only Indian dishes were displayed.  \n\nArriving just before 2, there was only one other customer.  I perused the offerings and filled my large plate with Vegetable Samosa, Chicken Tandoori and Chicken Makhani, Paneer Makhani, Chana Masala, Vegetable Biriyani and Naan.  They were all good, but none outstanding.  Having two Makhani dishes seemed redundant, but the sauce was nice and creamy. The Tandoori Chicken was the freshest on the table, as a new tray of it was brought out while I was loading up.  It was tender and easily separated from the bone.  It was predominantly thighs and drums.  The Biriyani was a nice dark color and had a pleasant flavor.  \n\nWhat I am discovering is that if you want to have Indian buffet for lunch, it is better to arrive early and eat when all the dishes are just out of the kitchen.  I am a late luncher, and it seems that many of the tureens are not heated, and left in the open for a few hours.  Many offerings are past their prime, and less enjoyable.  \n\nI was satisfied with my meal at New Moghul, but I have had much better North or South Indian victuals recently, and this place is not up to that standard.  To be completely fair, I will have to return for dinner and see if that changes the story.  Still, if a resto is going to offer a buffet it should be a reflection of what is available if ordering off the menu.  \n\nBy that guide, this place is only A-OK.",

I had not gone to many theaters until this year as it was easier to rent at home.  I am enjoying the big screen experience again. \n\nThis United Artists Theaters @ Oxford Valley Mall is a freestanding building on the outer ring of the property with plenty of parking, and a short walk to the food court across the parking field.  It is one of the slightly older generation of modern cinema multiplexes, built about 20 years ago with some refurbishments.  It is a pleasant place to watch a movie; bigger theaters, decent sound, but without IMAX at this time.  \n\nSaw Man of Steel last night with young son.  For a first week of a potential blockbuster on a Friday evening, the place was surprisingly underpopulated.  The seats are comfortable with drink holders, but not as spacious nor as comfy as @ Neshaminy Mall. The popcorn is not always fresh here, as they seem to only make it every few hours, rather than on a more ordered approach. That is a no-no as the popcorn available for home purchase these days is excellent, and this does not compare most of the time. I won't mention the prices.\n\nMy favorite movie venue is the old Newtown Theater, where I can easily imagine I am sitting in the dark sometime around 1960.  The seats are old and creaky, and the screen is not designed for HD, and the projection equipment is in need of replacement for 21st Century viewers; but it is still an awesome experience up in the balcony with girlfriend and chaperon.",

I don't understand why some places can't handle requests for well done (reheated) pizza, and insist that everyone wants it the same less than optimal temperature.  Still, I recognized that the crust was done decently, and the sauce/cheese ratio was fine.  Nice touch to see a sprig of basil.  I've had better. \n\nThe soup was another matter.  It was very hot (microwave reheat), with lots of chicken, veggies and a few noodles, in a nice mild bird bouillon. A shake of black pepper and I was in business.  I liked it a lot. Enough to remember to order it again when in the vicinity. \n\nI enjoyed sitting down next to a poster of Allen Iverson.  I would love a real meal with him to talk about his election to the Basketball Hall of Fame and what an awesome basketball warrior he was.",

    "text": "Dominick's has been the pizza standard bearer in Washington Crossing for decades, but I had not stopped to sample their pies for a very long time.  After a dinner at their sister ship in Richboro a few weeks ago, I was tempted to return here to see if the magic was carried from oven to oven.  I went in for lunch earlier this week to find out.\n\nFirst thing I noticed was that the once smallish primarily take out pizza parlor had expanded considerably.  It how had a dining room and a bar!  The rear area was dressed up a la a street scene in Napoli and the side barroom designed for those desirous of libations and wide screen TV with their Italian meal.  This room felt a little unfinished as things were stored in plain sight, and the quality of the furnishings did not match the richer feel of the wooden and mirrored bar.  \n\nI ordered two slices of regular Tomato Pie and took my seat in the barroom to await the call to get them after reheating.  That call never came, so I walked back into the central area to inquire.  The slices in the oven had been forgotten and were now two charred triangles ready for dumping.  Honest apologies were forthcoming.  They put in two more slices and promptly called me when ready.  \n\nThey held their points when lifted, and had a pleasing crunch to the last bite.  The sauce was mildly sweet as I prefer, and the mozza still white after the furnace indicating it had begun that morning as a fresh cheese.  Nice.  Thin ribbons of basil lay on top of both, adding another texture and taste dimension.  \n\nThese were good slices, but far from the best I have had in the past year.  Yet, the price with a Snapple came to under $6., which was a good deal.  \n\nTo be a fan, I have to feel a desire to return for more in a short time.  Short of that, it is fairest to say that the pie is decent, but not memorable enough for me to put it on the short list of favorite places, let alone the pizza pantheon of great pies. \n\nBy way of comparison, I found the Richboro location to be more comfortable, with better service and more compelling food.  This proved that carrying the same name and pedigree does not guarantee the same experience from place to place.",

The first was accomplished in less than 10 minutes just before 4:00 on a beautiful Spring afternoon.  The second took a bit longer, as I learned that in order to secure a license for a foreigner who is waiting for a Green Card, is to obtain a social security number first, and then have a doctor complete another form vouching that the applicant does not suffer from a seizure disorder.  Of course, these steps are easier said than done. \n\nAt least, we had already applied for a work permit as well as the Green Card, but how long we would have to wait for Homeland Security to process them was another matter entirely.  \n\nCan't blame one bureaucracy for the foibles of another, but being at their collective mercy left us with a sense of frustration and annoyance.  At least, these folks were friendly and capable of human interaction.  Same can't be said for DHS.",

Choices are limited to the part time place in the Newtown Farmers' Market, and this new house on State Street in Newtown Borough.  \n\nWoF is new and it appears they are still on their shakedown cruise.  While the signature offering is quite good, the overall gestalt is one of disorganization and lack of attention to detail. \n\nThe menu on the wall over the register/order area is limited to a few dishes, with the only real variety coming from the sides offered along with a falafel or eggplant pita or platter.  My styro plate was full of Israeli Salad, Hummus and BabaG, and the sandwich stuffed with Cukes, Tachini Sauce, and more Hummus.  Everything was fresh, but despite being put through a toaster belt, the pita remained room temp and lacked the complementary texture and taste of one heated first on the grill.  Therein lies part of the problem, in that there is no grill back there for that purpose.  \n\nThe staff is young and earnest, but seem to lack restaurant experience.  Management didn't notice that the trash receptacles were full and needed attention.  \n\nWorld of Falafel has an opportunity to be a successful Middle Eastern Caf\u00e9 if a few small steps are taken to bring up quality control.

The ubiquitous brown sauce was made to order, and was smooth, without lumpy flour balls. The fried rice on the other hand, was mass produced at an earlier time, and tasted it.

    "text": "TWO SLICE LUNCH REVIEW\n\nThe first time I stopped by Alforno's Pizza a few weeks ago it was closed without explanation. Finally returned to check it out yesterday. \n\nThe shop is one of those Mexican Italian hybrids. Mexican soaps on the telly, tacos on the menu next to standard Italian fare. There are quite a few in the area. They seemed to be doing some rehabbing in the kitchen because the walk-thru from the counter area was partially blocked by a refrigerator. \n\nI liked that they only had one pizza in the display case, rather than the multitude laying around in most parlors. Pies were made to order at least that day. A good thing. Still, I only wanted a couple of plain slices so I did not request they make a new pie for me. I asked that mine be reheated well done so as to achieve max reanimation. \n\nThat was exactly what I got a few minutes later. Black singed edges where the cheese touched hot metal and a slight darkening of the surface from the oven dragon's breath. Well done well done.\n\nI prefer crisp crust that can hold it's point when lifted from the outer edge. This test failed as the inner half collapsed under the moisture and weight of the topside cheese. Yet, the upper half was stronger and drier and held up well. Crunchy good with a nice flavor. In fact, that part of the pie was pretty good. The sauce was a little sweet and played well with the crust and cheese. Just wish that was so throughout. \n\nA little rebalancing of the cheese distribution on the pietop might fix this problem and result in a totally delicious pizza.",

It has been there for a few years and maintains a clean fresh look. This was my first visit despite the fact that my former law office was less than a half mile away. I really like Mexican food and this area has a lot of excellent cocinas Mexicanas, so \"The Belch\" was never high on my list of bookmarks. Still, its day had finally come.\n\nI went for a chicken quesadilla - something simple, well known by me, and not overloaded with cheese to ramp up unwanted calories. It arrived about ten minutes later in a paper and glassine bag on top of a tray. I pulled it from the bag and placed the four quandrants on top of it (no plate provided). It was very thin with a little cheese melted and hardening at the edges. It was very hot. \n\nThe taste and texture were fine, although not brimming with chicken. It could have been spicier throughout, but I found that all the chili powder was in only one piece of the pie. Not a major complaint, but how hard is it to spread the spice across the entire tortilla while on the grill? \n\nGiven how good the authentic Central American restaurants in the region are, Taco Bell will remain far down the list of choices, but at least their stuff is okay.",

It was described as being spicy, but wasn't.  The Chicken was overcooked and dry, and the Lemongrass flavor weak.  The only veggies were Green Peppers and Onions cut large.

I did not have dinner in this place as I did in Richboro, but at some point I will return to try it.\n\nI appreciate the success of a family business, and Dominick's is a story of humble beginnings becoming auspicious rewards.  \n\nWashington Crossing doesn't have many offerings, but Dom's has been holding the fort there for decades.",

So, don't be too discouraged as you drive down the street looking for 4059.  There it is on the south side of the street with the small white sign hanging high above the front door.  Rest assured that once you come inside you will be relieved to find yourself smack in the middle of 1959, greeted by a black and white poster of Marilyn Monroe and another of a more colorful James Dean.  \n\nRebel Without A Cause.\n\nBut, this time warping is a good thing.  The spacious dining room relaxes and helps recollect a time when things were good in grandma's home.  The wait people were lovely and straight from central casting.  They were in perpetual motion, bringing fresh coffee and large white plates full of grub to the starving masses.  When I came in, a group of ladies were in a breakfast meeting, and it looked like they might have been there for several years.  They showed no inclination to leave, and remained after I departed.  I wondered about their agenda.  \n\nThe deuce along the wall in the back space near the kitchen was a great place to watch the play unfolding.  The coffee came quickly in an odd mug, and with large half/half cupettes.  It was constantly refreshed before I reached the bottom, and it was not difficult to maintain the proper proportion of java to cream with small pours from the creamers. \n\n I ordered the French Toast (as I usually do), and was asked for the first time in my life whether I wanted thick or thin sliced bread.  Astute question.  While the intuitive decision is to get more and go with the thick cut, I have the contrary opinion.  Too often the thicker Texas/Challah Style leaves the bread eggless in its heart, and thus dry.  I prefer the thinner option as it tends to be moist to the center, thoroughly cooked, and better carmelized on the surface.  Those burn points provide the crunch I desire. \n\nWhen the plate arrived, it had six half slices of toast, well grilled, and heavily sprinkled with powdered sugar.  A small paper cup of butter allowed for a light application of lubricant and additional subtle flavoring.  The syrup came in an old spring load top pitcher, which I promptly lifted over the plate for a healthy pour.  \n\nThe French Toast was quite good, but not attaining the pantheon of the gods. It needed another minute on the hot grill, and a drop of vanilla in the egg mix for soft  mellow unique sweetness.  \n\nI will return to see Erwin again.  The menu looked to hold other secrets worth exploring, and it is not every day that I can slip in and out of the 50's without getting the bends.",

As such, it is one of the many culinary attractions that now predominate on this old main street along the mighty Delaware River.  On this beautiful Friday afternoon, the place to be is under a red umbrella on top of the red brick that are the sidewalks of this historic burg.  Failing that, the next best place to dine is in one of the large window wells on either side of the front door.  That is where I found myself, as all the outside tables were taken when I arrived.  \n\nWhat is a bit disconcerting about Oliver, is that the inside dining room is rather dark and uninteresting.  Just dark brown tables and chairs with dark carpet and some wall hangings.  No real color, lighting, nor energy.  I directed my attention out the large windows and onto the street on this sunny day, but felt the welling darkness over my shoulders.  \n\nMy French Dip Burger with optional side Caesar Salad was very attractive visually, although the puck was a little beyond the medium finish requested.  The description of this opus was of Swiss & Havarti Cheese melt, with Bourbon Caramelized Onions, Sour Cream Horseradish Sauce, and a side cup of Oliver Au Jus.  All those parts were present, and contributed to a good tasting burger.  I have always enjoyed a horseradish alternative to ketchup on my sliders, and it was good to satisfy this long delayed gratification.  It all came together well, especially when I occasionally dipped the burger into the Au Jus and savored the implanted memory of roast beef done this way.  The Caesar side was fresh, green and mildly anchovied.  Liked it. \n\nAt $12 for a full plated lunch, I was satisfied with the value received.  Come in closer to medium with pink center, and I would easily bump this experience up a star.  For a full blown 5 Star rating, something has to be done to lighten the gloom of the dining room.",

Traffic getting there was like swimming against a riptide, but once parked and inside things slowed down nicely.\n\nThe entrance foyer was large and empty, but for a solitary women behind a counter who directed us to either the lounge or dining room.

No one in uniform noticed our arrival, as we sat for several minutes with staff walking by without capturing their attention. I finally flagged down a server, who brought us menus and said someone would be with us shortly. She was, and we ordered our first margarita and Modelo Negro while reading the menu. \n\nWe chose the Steak Fajitas and Fish Tacos del Mar from the Lunch Specials. Chips & Salsa were good and spicy. The steak was plentiful and nicely pink within, while well blackened without. The side of fixings - lettuce, salsa, crema fresca, onions and guacamole, and 4 hot tortillas, allowed for alot of handiwork. We both liked the platter. \n\nThe fish tacos were okay, but not what was ordered. They were not the del mar version, but the straight fish tacos.  Thus, they lacked the proper sauce, cilantro and avocado; but had an aioli cream and red cabbage finish. Not even the roasted corn relish described on the menu for this dish was present. This was the more disappointing given that our server had recommended the del mar, but didn't recognize that she didn't have it in her hands. \n\nHonestly, it wasn't until I read the menu again online in preparation for this review that I realized what happened. Retroactive annoyance. \n\nThis was not a bad experience, but for this. While not authentic Mexican cuisine, it knows how to make what we gringos like. Too, the bar lubricated us well.",

    "text": "Provecho (advantage/good fortune) Mexican Grill on Philmont Avenue, Huntingdon Valley, PA, is a decent cafe style Mexican restaurant with a nice vibe, friendly service and kitchen that turns out a limited menu of traditional  platas somewhat tempered for the American palette. It is colorful with large wall murals and a few nooks with comfortable chairs and small tables right out of the Salvation Army store.  \n\nWe were there early on a Saturday night, grabbed one of those tables under a mural, and ordered their chicken soup, shrimp fajitas and chicken taquitos. The soup was excellent. Shredded white meat bird, chunky carrots and smaller pieces of onion, it had big flavor from simmering all day long. The fajitas had plenty of medium sized shrimp, well grilled and lightly spiced over slices of peppers and onions. Rice, beans, queso fresca, sour cream and a dollop of creamy guacamole completed the platter. \n\nEven with complimentary salsa added (not gratis across the board?!) the flavor was muted, and not the blast of spices and textures expected. The large amount of rice was offset by its blandness, although the refried beans were tasty. The three taquitos were stuffed with chicken, cheese and pepper and topped with the same finish as the fajitas. They were crisply deep fried and looked great. The chicken was again under spiced and even the chipotle salsa was too weak to kick it up to tickle the tongue. \n\nI have no problem with charging for chips and salsa, but add on cost for salsa (even homemade variations) is ahead of the curve of acceptable charges for accessories necessary for the fulfillment of the underlying dish. It's like charging for ketchup on your burger, or cream for your coffee. Never saw that in all my time in Mexico, nor in any of the dozens of very good Mexican houses around Montco. Perhaps, they need to do that to keep doors open, but it seemed ungenerous to these guests.",

It is a one room restaurant with exposed beam cathedral ceiling, orange wash walls and a few Buddhist hangings. The western exposure made for strong afternoon sunlight through the windows, so I moved to the other side of my table to cut down the glare. \n\nThe was a large party at one end of the room keeping the one server occupied most of the time, but she kept her cool and managed to help me and another couple with our orders. She had skills and pleasant disposition. \n\nThere was no lunch menu on Sunday, so I went with their Pad Kee Mao (veggie drunken noodles), which I have had an addiction to for the past few months. I love those wide rice noodles, hot spice and heavy brown sauce, and each of the versions I have tried were distinct from each other, despite the same ingredients. Some have been amazing, while others have not. \n\nToday's were toward the bottom of the spectrum to date. The noodles were plentiful, but aside from the bell peppers, onion and basil that come standard with the dish, there were only a few slim carrot slices and broccoli  florets to represent the vegetable kingdom. Not a mushroom, sprout nor stringbean in the lot. The spicing was not what I expected, neither chili nor lemongrass, but more a salt, black and/or white ground pepper with something else I couldn't identify. It was barely okay, and far from my favorite. \n\nIt wasn't a great effort. Maybe they were saving the rest of the produce for that big party across the room.\n\n2.5 STARS",

    "text": "Nary a leprechaun in the house, but The Irish Horne markets itself as an Irish Bar. It is entitled to call itself whatever it wants, but the reality here is that aside from a half dozen Emerald Isle menu items and Guinness on tap, this is a new sports bar in the heart of Richboro, PA, with a lot of suds on tap and no corned beef and cabbage. \n\nIt is attractive with large rectangular bar except where it runs into the rear wall, plenty of brew choices and large format menu with predominantly traditional bar food and a tip of the cap to those Irish like dishes. I asked for Magnar's Irish Cider and a Shepherds Pie (although their House Burger was equally tempting). I was still finding out about the brogue in the kitchen. \n\nThe Magnars was excellent. Cool, tart apple and easy going down. No kick. No bite. The Shepherds Pie arrived in a small cast iron oven ready dish, still too hot to touch, and a soup spoon. It was topped with mashed potatoes over a ground beef, gravy understrata. The taste was fine, but it fell short in the veggie department. There were few carrot/pea/corn participants, and those that were there seemed from a bag of frozen mixed vegetables.\n\n Disappointing. \n\nHow much better it would have been with serious veggie chunks to add texture and interest to the experience. As they were, they were practically invisible on the tongue. Perhaps, a deeper dish would allow for this. At $13.50, the value proposition is just not compelling when the standard burger offers more meat and veggies than does the Pie, for $4 less. And comes with fries! \n\nSo, while The Irish Horne has many good attributes, it should make more of an effort to really be an Irish bar, and consider how to improve their signature kitchen offerings.",

It was so bright at my booth that I had to close the shades to keep from sweating. \n\nThere were only four other tables occupied when I arrived. I was greeted promptly and escorted to my booth. Coffee and menu arrived moments later. I hadn't been inside a Denny's in years, and my memory of Country Fried Steak was dominant in my head. I ordered that. It included two eggs (scrambled wet), and rye toast, in addition to the unlimited java. Service was friendly and timely. I was approached every few minutes as to my satisfaction and needs. Never felt neglected. \n\nMy tastes have changed since the last time I had this breakfast in my early twenties. I remembered the crunch and meatiness of the steak, but had forgotten how heavily cloying the gravy was. I was able to remove a lot of it, but it was still a strong element of the meal, making for a salty and overly caloric feast. Still, the eggs were done perfectly, and their home fries were nicely crisp. With the three mugs of coffee I drank, it was a filling meal. \n\nNot sure there will be a next time, as, obviously, I seldom have the urge for Denny's. Yet, it was a decent, if salty, breakfast. It briefly connected me to my earlier life, and alerted me to how my tastes have changed. If there were to be a next time, I would lean to the french toast or pancakes, which they offer in abundant varieties. Prices are still quite reasonable.",

They are so busy building the latest version that when I walked in for a snack and coffee I thought I was in a Seven Eleven. It was that disconcerting. \n\nStill, it had the snacks and it had plenty of coffee, so I got what I came for.

The coffee was fine. \n\nI don't actually use the gas pumps at Wawa, as they don't identify the refiner, nor distributor of the fuel, and thus there is no assurance of the quality of the gasoline, nor the additives that may/may not have been added. That being so, I would go to this chain more often if I didn't have to deal with the gas station aspect of the operation. \n\nOn the other hand, assure me of the content of the gas and list it's pedigree, and I would be more willing to take advantage of the convenience once in a while, especially when away from my local friendly businessman and neighbor traditional gas station.",

    "text": "A few years ago I noticed that Mill Street, Bristol, PA, was experiencing a rebirth of vital commerce with many new stores, restaurants, cafes and even a classy bakery with a beautiful dining room and sugar coma inducing display of cookies, cakes, danish and donuts. That shop, Angelina's, was the subject of my breakfast explorations last week. \n\nFirst impressions were tremendous. Everything was whitewashed and had a Victoriana vibe. There were a dozen or so tables, and counter/highchairs in the two window bays on either side of the front door. Further back, the baked goods sat shelved and lit like colorful jewels and crystals waiting to be bagged and consumed. So seductive. \n\nI sat close by the front and checked the front of the two sided breakfast/lunch menu. I went with the \"Thin French Toast,\" over the \"Thick\" alternative. I figured I was in a bakery, and it had to know about the proper approach to this traditional dish. Well, perhaps I was overconfident about that. \n\nThe first clue of what was to come was the delivery of the FT accessories - butter and Smuckers syrup. The spread was fine, but that amber colloidal suspension was all high fructose corn syrup, about the worst thing for a human body. Luckily when the plate arrived, the four pieces of bread were sprinkled with powdered sugar, so I could skip the drip. Regular sugar is a better choice than artificial or high fructose sweetener.\n\nWhen the finished platter arrived it looked good. I spread the butter to melt on the surface and cut a small wedge. It was obvious that it had spent little time in the egg/sugar/cinnamon/vanilla extract mix. The outside was nicely grilled, but the inside was dry. It had not been dredged in the mixing bowl long enough to permit absorption, but put too quickly on the grill. The chef needs find a better recipe.\n\n Oh, well. This wasn't going to be my best morning. *%It happens. \n\nI'll be back to check out those georgeous pastries. I suspect that is where I should have begun this adventure.",

It does seem a little out of place sitting on Smithville Road in Eastampton, NJ, but that does not detract from its pleasant scale.  Outdoor patio seating for nice days is a definite upgrade from the ordinary java joint.  \n\nI stopped in around 10 am for a light breakfast and coffee.  The large menu is suspended from the ceiling behind the cashiers.  Only brekkie sandwiches are available during the week, although a full brunch operation happens on weekends.  No sweat.  I wasn't looking or a big and hearty meal.  The unmistakable aroma of baked bread permeated the room, although they were not baking anything when I was there. The racks behind the counter were loaded to make a bread lover swoon.  All shapes and sizes demonstrated the artistry of the baker. Impressive.\n\nMy Sausage, Egg & Cheese on a Roll was okay, but not more. Their bread was fresh, but lacked the texture and yeastiness I expected from a homemade offering. The sausage patty was about the thinnest I have encountered, but still tasty.  The fried eggs and cheese were ample, and clearly cooked/melted on the grill.  At under $6 for the whole shebang I was ultimately satisfied with the value, if not the exuberance of the sandwich. \n\nMaybe their brunches have more of a \"Wow!\" factor.",

    "text": "Maybe if I hadn't just returned from a trip to southern Virginia where BBQ is a daily part of existence, I would have been more overcome with smoke ring lust for the meat factory that is Sweet Lucy's Smokehouse, but it was that travel into the near South that had me wanting more Q, and Lucy's was getting all the local accolades. It was the natural place to go.  \n\nThe adaptive reuse of an old industrial brick and mortar was well done, and the layout of the plant was well conceived with nice \"country\" dining area, new bar with very good brew list, and an efficient order and table delivery system.  Yet, their efficiencies cut some corners that should have been left in place.  \n\nAs first timers not knowing the lay of the land, the order and sit down process had to be explained, and the ability to have Q & A with someone about the menu important.  That was not really provided with pressure on the cashier to take orders as people stood before them and then accept payment.  It was hard to ask about the various options and receive comprehensive answers.  We ordered the BBQ Pulled Pork Platter, Half Rotisserie Chicken Platter and the Double the Fun (Ribs & Pulled Pork) Platter; all with Cornbread and a cross section of the many side dishes.  The prices were reasonable, and the wait not too long.  Going over to the bar in the dining room was easy enough, but required a second payment.  Unless you knew you would have room for desert and ordered with the entre, another queue-up was required.  Easier for the business, perhaps, but not for the customer.  \n\nThen, everything arrived in styro and plastic wrap - a turnoff for both comfort and ecological reasons.  Open your white foam package with someone sitting across from you, and the top of each was overlapping and in the way of the other.  Awkward.  \n\nThere was plenty of meat and ample sides.  Yet, rather than using a confident dry rub in the smoker that would let the meat speak for itself, and allow a choice of saucy finishes, the plate arrived already covered in Kansas City style thick and somewhat salty/sour dark amber glaze. This one size fits all approach denied a choice of flavors that is so elemental to the full BBQ experience.  Personally, I prefer a sweet/tangy bite and chew that comes from a St. Louis, Memphis or even Carolina smokehouse, but there were no table rockets with these options, and I was unaware of any sauce alternatives as a newbie.  My Ribs were smoked well with pink ring, and it easily pulled off the bone.  Still, I would have been happier with a different sauce encasing the experience.  The Pulled Pork was soft and pleasantly chewy, but had a vinegar taste that was not my cup of tea.  Again, allow me to mix in what my tastebuds prefer, and I would have been a happier camper.  \n\nThe sides were all pretty good without any of them being standouts.  On the other hand, the Cornbread was excellent.  \n\nGiven the great beer choices and the generous portions, this could have been a full fledged BBQ riot with the ability to elect how I wanted the meal to cross my palette. I would gladly pay a bit more, or gorge a bit less, if given free choice (and be pleased with the meal arriving on a large swatch of paper rather than plastic). \n\nSo near, but yet so far.",

The only thing missing is a counter with stools for those who prefer that old line dining experience, like me. \n\nI stopped in for diner last weekend, hoping for a good meal for this solitary traveler. I had to wait about 15 minutes for a table, as the place was SRO when I arrived around 6 pm. A stool at a counter would have eliminated the wait, but I did not mind standing in the entrance area and observing all the scurry from the staff. It also gave me the chance to check out the cakes, pies and other bakery goods made on premises. Certainly did not hurt my appetite. \n\nI was eventually shown to a table in the back, and handed the short novelette menu. So much food; so little time. I chose their meatloaf mini dinner, with mashed and cup of soup or salad bar. I grazed over the greens for a while and returned with a full plate of various salad components. It wasn't a stunningly broad spread, and a lot of it was processed and not fresh, but it still provided many colors and flavors that worked well on top of a lettuce base. Three bean salad, beets, red onion, macaroni and potato salad, baby spinach, pickled everything, cheesebread and 1,000 Island dressing, kept me munching while waiting for the mains. \n\nWhen my entre arrived, I was confronted by two huge slices of baked/grilled beef loaf and a dish of white mashed, with brown gravy on the side. The meat was tender and tasty, but better with a jet of ketchup, than the brown sauce (a bit salty). The slices were about 1.5 inches thick. I couldn't finish the meal. Absolutely no room for the luscious looking desserts.\n\nAt a price around $10., the value was evident in every bite. \n\nI'm told Eagle does a good job for breakfast, too. Next time I'm in the area that time of day, I'll stop in again to check it out.",

    "text": "Golden Dragon at the corner of Liberty & Franklin, Trenton, NJ., looks like a new entry in the Chinese Take Out Wars.  The shop is cleaner than many, with room for four tables for those who prefer to eat in (like me).  The young family that runs the show seem to know what they're doing, with the wife at the counter taking orders and money, and hubby wok and rolling in the kitchen.  The third wheel, perhaps a brother, helps out and does deliveries.  \n\nThe lunch specials are the standard pork, chicken and shrimp in a variety of overlapping goopy sauces.  The fried rice is made in one large batch and has the yellow dye of most other chicken broth based steamers.  Unlike many of the other houses, this one is full of chunks of pork, peas, onion and carrots.  It actually tasted good.  My Pork Egg Foo Young was two pancakes, crisped edges, and loaded with meat, veggies and spouts.  The brown sauce was decent and packaged separately to keep things firm and able to be used at will.  It was a decent version of this old time dish.  \n\nService was as limited as you would expect a basic take away store to be.  No accommodation for customers wanting to eat at a table.  Everything packaged in styro and plastic, with thin fork and spoon to handle the mouth shovels. \n\nStill, at under $6., with soup or soda, it was a good deal.   \n\nNice quality for a take out joint, even if they don't really want you eating there.  Offer hot tea in addition to soda, and put the food on a real plate with better plasticware for those who eat in, and Golden Dragon could easily be a four star experience in take out cuisine.\n\nUPDATE: MAY 3, 2017 -  Have to say that my second visit to Golden Dragon has put me in a generous mood about the quality of their food. Today I sampled their Hot & Sour Soup and General Tso's Chicken.  \n\nThe soup was surprisingly good.  It contained fresh cut mushrooms floating on top, and two types of soft tofu beneath.  The vinegar quotient was just right, and with the other veggies within, was about the best Chinese take out hot & sour I can remember tasting. Sucked all of that plastic container's contents dry.  The Chicken was also mostly meat and less shell, with a nicely balance spicy/sweet dark brown topaz sauce. The fried rice was plentiful, and although mass produced, still granular and full of pork, pea, carrot, etc. chunks.  \n\nOverall, an impressive lunch from this far flung outpost of the Chinese Empire at the corner of Franklin and Liberty.  \n\nDo it again, and you could find yourself the recipient of a full forth star.  But, for now...\n\n3.5 Stars, with a bullet!",

    "text": "I've driven around the block on various occasions trying for a parking spot within hailing distance of Trenton Bagel Shop on South Broad Street in Trenton, just one block south of State Street.  Never found one and thus was never able to walk into the shop until last Friday when I was at the NJ Motor Vehicle Commission over on Stockton Street.  After our appeals hearing was over (successfully), I decided this was the best chance to get over there.  It was about a quarter mile away, but it was a nice day for a walk. \n\nThe store was larger than expected, with a big kitchen area and several tables around the perimeter.  The bagel selection was depleted at 10:30, but I ordered an Everything Bagel, Butter and Swiss and Java from the pleasant women behind the counter.  The $3.50 price for all this was a pleasant surprise.  Left the balance of my fin in the tip jar.  \n\nOn first bite it was obvious that my bagel was no longer fresh from the oven, and had been around at least since early in the morning.  It wasn't bad, it just wasn't at its apex texture and taste.  Looking toward the rear of the space I tried to find evidence of baking on premises, but could neither see, hear nor smell anything like hot dough in the air.  Could well be that the bagels were created elsewhere and delivered.  Not a problem when the bread is fresh, but tends to staleness before a round hole baked only a few feet away.  \n\nThe coffee was that \"Law\" company product.  Not the best brew for take out as it drifts into bitterness as it cools.  \n\nGlad I finally checked out Trenton Bagel, but given the difficulty of approaching the shop via auto, and the step below first quality of both its namesake and the Joe, there is no urge to return anytime soon.",

It is well maintained, has friendly professional staff, large menu and reasonable prices. \n\nI stopped in for breakfast recently, and sat on a stool at the traditional counter. Coffee was immediately available from the Bunn-O-Matic, and my request for milk over creamer was met with a small glass of moo juice. The daily special omelette was described well, and server and I agreed quietly that ham, bacon and sausage was just too much meat for three eggs to handle. Opted instead for short stack french toast and java only. Lately, it seems I am not as hungry in the morning, which helps explain the increased bagginess of my pants. \n\nThe thick white load was good with adequate saturation of the egg/vanilla/sugar mix into the heart of both slices. The soft butter and Smuckers table syrup finished off the plate. It was all grilled well, but providing a pour of pure Grade B maple would have been so much more satisfying. I would pay a buck or two extra for that sweet smokiness soaked into my bread. The cuppa joe was decent and refilled frequently. \n\nI departed $10 the poorer, including gratuity. Not bad for this part of Street Road, right down the street from Parx Casino.",

This must be how a marriage between Thai and Vietnamese looks.  Glistening stars against a black night sky, and warm sunset tones from wall to wall.  Very attractive.  The only issue I have comes from their apparent success.  The place is excessively loud, making normal conversation across the table difficult.  \n\nBut, who talks while slurping Pho?  I ordered the Steak and Brisket Pho (Pho Tai Chin), and it arrived promptly, a steaming large bowl of Beef Broth, Noodles, lots of thin sliced Beef, with a nice plate of Thai Basil, Bamboo Shoots, Jalapeno Slices, Lime Wedges, with Hoisin and Sriracha on the side to add zest where needed.  \n\nIt was very good - rich, savory, subtle undertones and long untamed noodles waiting to uncoil like a nest of vipers.  I enjoyed every slurping spoonful and chopstick clasp of it.  The only reservation would be he $9.95 cost, which is a couple of bucks more than other places I frequent.  I guess you pay for the popularity, because the place was crowded.  \n\nWhile I wouldn't rush back to Pho Thai Nam as it was no better than similar places closer to home, and there are other highly recommended joints nearby, I certainly would not hesitate to return should someone desire the experience.",

But, for the associated AMC theaters across the parking fields, a few restaurants in the circle around it, and many medical offices, I would likely never frequent the place. \n\nIt seems that malls are a 20th Century phenomenon whose time may have passed them by, unless they are reconceptualized and reconfigured to meet the more dynamic needs of families, and consumers.  A sense of community purpose is required that is both traditional and state of the art. \n\nUntil that happens most malls will continue to lose stores and visitors. Just as the horse and buggy were replaced by the automobile, and the urban core was redistributed to the burbs (and now contracting again), the mall will eventually evolve into a new kind of commercial center than includes everything the old village maintained, but wired into today.",

Our burritos (chicken & shrimp) were stuffed to the max, and the two young guys devouring them barely came up for air. My flautas de carnitas were nicely rolled, stuffed and grilled tortillas full of roast pork, chilies, cheese, with bright red salsa, avocado, shredded lettuce and drizzled crema on top. Looked and tasted good. \n\nAlthough we ate in, the food was brought to us as if it was to go. Plastic plates and utensils, wrapped in foil, etc. I prefer to be treated like a dine in customer when electing to eat while the food is hot, and would pay a little more for the pleasure. Too, the environment would benefit from less throw away stuff. \n\nI liked Peppe's, understood it's neighborhood, but it could make a few moves to be a lot better. They do make their own horchata, which is a great sign of the possibilities.",

    "text": "This was my first visit to a Costco, and I was duly overwhelmed and even impressed. Our neighbor is a member and came along with the secret password and handshake. \n\nThese are mega warehouses where most things are offered in bulk, whether you actually need that much quantity or not. Clothing to HDTVs, tires to industrial strength pancake mix, and everything in between. At the end of almost every aisle, free samples of food being sold nearby; so if hungry, you can graze your way from appetizers to dessert, and add the savings from lunch (although I hear the hot dogs in the cafe are very good) to the overall value.\n\nEven though my household isn't big enough to warrant purchasing on this scale, I found myself seduced by the sheer magnitude of the offerings. I soon took leave of my senses, disregarded the reality that we just couldn't eat all the food while it was fresh at the scale it was displayed, and began to think that the lower price would save money despite the fact that it would become outdated in the pantry. \n\nWhat a perverse incentive! \n\nBuy more than you need and convince yourself that the lower cost per unit is saving you money, when the exact opposite is true. Money is wasted getting marginally useful or taking flyers on stuff you really don't need or are unlikely to consume in a timely manner. The cupboard will be full of things you won't believe you were crazy enough to buy after the intoxication wears off. I don't know about you, but I spent way more than I do in a normal shopping trip, yet still found we needed to go to the local supermarket for all the things Costco didn't have. Knocked our budget out of whack. \n\nWhy? So I saved a little on a huge box of Cheerios that will take six months to finish; the last half of which will be stale. Or, for two years worth of ketchup, the last bottle of which will have separated and taste like crapchup by the time I open it. \n\nBut, I saved a buck over buying only when ready to use it. Right?!\n\nWrong!\n\nThe only way this works efficiently for consumers is to go after eating a big meal, skipping all the free samples, and being disciplined with a list of the things it makes sense to buy at Costco, and NOTHING ELSE. Wear blinders. Don't browse. Don't allow temptation to seduce. \n\nRun in. Run out. \n\nOtherwise, like the poor Ulysses, you will fall victim of the Siren sweetly singing, just like I did. Poor soul.\n\nThere must be a 12 step program.\n\nCan't wait to go back.",

It is a large, comfortable shop with Kids Playroom (currently closed due to Covid), fire pit with worn easy chairs around it, and large self-serve coffee station with several java options. The vibe was welcoming and service friendly. \n\nI ordered an Onion Bagel with Veggie Cream Cheese, one of my standards. It was ready in minutes, packed neatly in a white paper sack. I drove home and dove in. \n\nThe dough wheel was regular size and there was enough spread for a balanced chew. First glance, the color of the bagel appeared pale white compared to others I have eaten in recent months. The toasted onion flakes were larger than most bagelries, and were only on the top crown, with none on the side nor bottom. Too, the texture was denser than I prefer, indicating more kneading than necessary for a lighter, airier center. All in all, it left the impression that this was really a plain bagel with onion flakes added later on. My guess is that they also bake with bleached flour, rather than unbleached, which provides more color and flavor.\n\nThe bagel was okay, but would have been so much better with more attention to right ingredients, technique, and finish. A bagel school refresher course would likely do the trick.",

The result being a soggy, but tasty, mess, adding far too much sugar and unwanted calories to an otherwise simple creation. The flavor of the tuna was drowned out, and I had to find extra paper hand towels to keep the fallout under control. \n\nThe shop itself was exceptionally clean, and the counter person friendly as she completed my order after my arrival. She was generous with the accoutrements, and therein lay the problem. There was so much being stuffed into the torpedo that in wrapping up in waxed sandwich paper, I could see it starting to leak around the edges. Upon unwrapping at my desk, the excess moisture was escaping, and rivulets of sauce were flowing everywhere. With each bite food was evacuating out the back door, and my hands were getting drenched. The supply of thin non-absorbent napkins was quickly exhausted, and my fingers dripping and sticky. \n\nJust not the kind of thing designed for a tidy working lunch. Yes, it tasted pretty good, but I had to wash my hands and face before touching anything else. If there is a next time, I will be better prepared, or better yet, get the superior Primo hoagies on the other side of town with that special sesame seeded roll.",

There is the new Goodnoe's on Sycamore Street, Zebra Striped Whale on State Street in the Borough, Owowcow up Rt. 413 in Wrightstown, and Sweet Pea Creams in the new Goodnoe's Corner (which stands on the holy ground of the original ice cream emporium of the same family name).\n\nTo my taste buds, Sweet Pea is decent, but the weakest entrant in the icecreamcapades.  I was there tonight with a group of kids from a local school after a 6th grade theater performance(that's another review).  I was lucky to have a Yelp deal for one free topping as a bonus.  Even with crushed peanut butter cups gracing a scoop of Burgundy Cherry Vanilla (or was it Bourgeoisie Cherry?) and Vanilla Pretzel Logic, the comparison of the local competition had me feeling a bit underwhelmed.  It is not that it was bad or unsavory.  It was only that it could not block out the memory of the others.  If a dish of glace is to achieve greatness it has to at least still the taste recordings of its near peers.  This Sweet Pea Creams could not do for me. It was somehow thinly sweeter and less engaging to the senses. Creamy, yes. Demanding complete attention, no.\n\nWe all have our favorites, and this place may be one of yours. I totally understand. But for me, I salivate most in anticipation of Goodnoes, followed by Owowcow, ZSW, and then Sweet Pea.  And, drooling in advance of a taste experience is what great ice cream is all about.",

As the name strongly suggests, Wings are what this place is all about, although they are making a strong effort to be diversified in their menu offerings.  \n\nQuesadillas, Ribs, Salads, Wraps, Burgers, Chicken Sandies, and Fries round out the growing comfort food menu.  They even have Pierogies. Super Bowl Sunday is their Christmas and New Years Day rolled into one.  They bemoan the end of the NFL season, as business slows down dramatically.  The owners and staff are very friendly, and make the place feel like the corner store.  The downside is that although there is a modern oven that allows grilling and baking in enclosed equipment, the wall of deep oil fryers tells you that the food is not the healthiest to eat, regardless of taste. The dozens of large plastic bottles full of sauces sitting on shelves and the floor also are somewhat disconcerting.  \n\nStill, they are very good at what they do.  The Wings are large, lightly coated and fried for a good, crunchy taste.  The Burgers are 10 oz. before cooking, and come out at the right finish with a large varieties of toppings. Mine was just medium, as requested, with Jalapenos, Onions, and Provolone. I think it is called the, \"Philly Burger.\" The weak link was the bun, which could not handle the weight and juices from its companion.  It quickly became mushy and fell apart when attempting to pick it up at home.  Knife and fork were brought in to finish the job.  Probably, if eaten there this would not become and issue.  The Fries were very good, and reminded of 5 Guys, slid into a brown paper sack where the oils stains quickly appear.  \n\nIt was a nice moment to return to Just Wingin' It after many years away.  The place looks nicer with new furnishings, and state of the art oven, and the food remains solid.  While I feel no compulsion to go back again soon, it is good to know they have succeeded, and they remain a popular place to satisfy the Wing Lust in all of us.",

The cheese was fine, but lacked the sharpness that would have given the overall experience a bigger \"bite.\"  Still, it was satisfying.  \n\nThe Fries were standard, but crisp and a plus. \n\nThere seem to be mixed reviews about the pizza, but given that the pannini was pretty good, I will return with some help to work on a pizza.\n\nMy first impression was positive, but I could not escape the thought that with a little more attention to detail, Adriana's could jump to the next level of Italian osteria, and really make its mark in the area.",

    "text": "Aside from the dude hanging up without an answer when I called to see if The Sticky Wicket was open for lunch, the joint itself isn't a bad place for a dive bar with adequate kitchen.  \n\nLocated in a desolate part of Trenton that at one time attempted to be a modern commercial area, it now is one of the few remaining tenants in Independence Square. The space is large, with an attached liquor store and a large rectangular bar with room to sit and have a meal.  The atmosphere is dark and wood paneled, giving the feeling that there are things in the corners you might not want to know about.  With a few hunting trophies on the walls, TSW could be a Western dive bar, as it has the feel of a large cabin.  \n\nI ordered a medium patty melt burger, fries and a cold Angry Orchard Apple Cider.  The prices were pretty good, with the food under $8., and the coldie at $5.50.  Good, friendly staff, and many regulars who seemed to know each other and kept the repartee moving along.  My patty melt was half medium as requested, but the other half was well done, no doubt from pushing it to the side of the grill to give it lower heat, but failing to turn it to keep the cooking balanced.  Although the menu claims the patties were never frozen, I have doubts about that given the crumbly nature of the finished puck.  It was an okay sandwich, but could have been much more given the copious fried onions, and melty cheese. I liked that it was on marble rye.  \n\nIt is nice to know that Sticky Wicket is open and keeping busy.  It is a cool place to hang out over lunch.  If they served up a better burger I would become a fan.",

    "text": "Stumbled upon Zeeno's the other day after a stop at Oxford Valley Mall to pick up something at Sears.  I just needed a snack to keep my hunger at bay.  \n\nI went it to find a brightly lit pizza joint with 8 to 10 tables along one wall, and the work area/cashier on the other.  Kitchen in the back.  It seemed fairly clean.  World Cup on the HD hanging from the wall.  I ordered two plain slices to test the water.  \n\nThe chef came out of the kitchen to deliver my lunch.  The slices were smaller than normal, and the outer crust smooth rather than textured.  This was a cheese over sauce pie, where the sauce hides beneath the melted mozza.  This maintains the heat better than exposing the gravy, but also adds a lot of extra cheese to accomplish this approach.  I prefer a balance with less cheese so I can taste the sauce distinctly.  I would call this a Middle Eastern Pizza, rather than Italian.  Not bad, but not in the mainstream of East Coast tomato pie.  \n\nWhile it was not my favorite pizza, it was adequate for what it was.  The ingredients were fine; just not the style I like. The rest of the menu looked intriguing, especially if the kitchen was consistently eastern Mediterranean.  The gyro options might be the way to go here.",

    "text": "This is a Tale of Two Cities kind of review. \n\nThe shop sits on a concrete island on Business Rt. 1 in Penndel, Pa.  It's the kind of location where the only green you can see is the crabgrass in the cracks in the sidewalk. Not a pretty place.  Yet, the inner space is not bad - bright, lots of glass, and an open kitchen where you can see food being prepared if you care to do that in fast food joints.  \n\nThe food we tried was schizophrenic.  The Western Burger (w/ A1 Sauce and large Onion Ring) was a frozen patty that was lifeless and too well done when it reached the table.  The crinkle cut fries were plentifully boring. Never do that again.\n\nYet, the Pressure Fried Chicken was another story all together.  The breasts were large and juicy.  The skin crisp and nicely spiced.  This seemed to be a clucker that had never been frozen.  It was among the best fried chicken I have had in the area during my recent obsession with this cuisine.  \n\nThe menu is large, but it mostly revolved around deep fryer, pressure cooker and grill.  They do BBQ, Hoagies, Panini, Wraps, Soup and Salads.  Some of those choices looked pretty good as other folks wolfed them down.  \n\nThe Tummy Yummies is a name that is cringeworthy, but they may just do enough things right to make it worth the occasional stop.",

    "text": "La Morena (The Brunette), sits on East Moreland Avenue just off the intersection with S. York Road in Hatboro, PA. It is a very small casa Mexicana, with about six tables with kitchen in the rear. It offers no parking, making for a difficult time for a vehicle if not familiar with this area. Apparently, there is an unmarked public lot across the street and down the block, but it is hard to see at night. \n\nThe menu is fairly much standard South of the Border fare, with somewhat higher than average prices, particularly in the dinner section. Service is provided by a very pleasant woman who I took to be La Morena, herself. She seems to be doing everything, including cooking, bussing, cleaning and greeting. There is one other person in the kitchen. \n\nI ordered the chili relleno (stuffed pablano pepper) dinner, including rice, refried beans and side container of fairly fresh tortillas. The pepper was a fatty, with room for diced chicken in addition to the queso and crema. Decent red salsa poured over the top. It was good and filling, but not outstanding. Actually, the refried beans were the best part of the platter, with interesting flavor. I thought it should have been better for the $14 charge, especially since I had a similar dinner a few weeks before at a nearby Mexican restaurant for several dollars less, with much more compelling taste. The tortillas were clearly reheat jobs, as part of each was hot, while the rest was cold. \n\nGiven the dearth of parking, and the less than stellar performance of my dinner, the conglomerated experience was just okay. I think the kitchen is capable of better, but I may have missed the right selection to discover its greatness.",

It is primarily a takeout Chinese shop that also makes sushi rolls and Thai noodles to widen it's appeal. There are only two tables in the front of the house, but an effort has been made to make the space attractive with a few Asian design elements. \n\nI stopped in for a late lunch and grabbed a table after ordering Sesame Chicken at the counter from a dude wearing a backward baseball cap. The guys in the kitchen must have taken a sushi correspondence course, but skipped the class on proper costuming for fish slicers, because they lacked the proper headwear and aprons that create the sushi effect. So, try the Japanese menu at your own risk. \n\nI prepared for the worst, but to my surprise the lunch was okay. There was ample bird cut small, with a better than expected amber goop atop average fried rice. It presented in a black plastic bowl, a step up from straight styro containers. No soup, nor drink included for the low $5.99 price. Never heard of hot tea either. \n\nWhile there is no reason to rush back unless you lived in the neighborhood, Levittown Kitchen at least fairly represents the Chinese American genre dishes reasonably well. I would find more authentic cultural  skills for the other options.",

    "text": "International Noodles is the second incarnation of an Asian house at this location since the departure of the dearly missed, Siam Restaurant.  It appears to be operated by the same people who owned Basil Leaf and the recently replaced Asiana.  \n\nThe ambiance is austere with simple tables spaced around the floor, and a grass thatch roof trim along the walls.  The hard finished floor made for a very clean appearance.  The staff the night we were there were local high school students, who were all pleasant, but somewhat lacking the comfortable personas of experienced servers.  They were fine. \n\nThe menu offers noodle based alternatives from the Pacific Rim.  Pho from Vietnam, Ramen and Udon from Japan, Pad Thai from Thailand,  spicy mein from China, and Mei Fun from Singapore, etc. We sampled the Udon with Tempura Shrimp & Veggies, and Pad Thai (Shrimp, Chicken).  \n\nThe plates came out loaded with appropriately dressed Pad Thai noodles.  It looked good, and had a pleasant taste, although additional spice/heat was required to bring up the authentic flavor.  I found that while the noodles were plentiful and quite hot, the slices of chicken were room-temperature, a sign that they were prepared separately beforehand and not mixed in the wok with the sauce and noodles after they were removed from their boil. An oversight that is easily remedied with more attention to detail.  \n\nThe Udon bowl was a decent representation of the Japanese soup; clear, mildly fishy, fat noodles and steaming.  Even better was the tempura that was surprisingly substantial alongside the soup.  The menu only mentioned shrimp tempura, but when the dish arrived, there were two large shrimp and several well prepared veggies, including, onion, carrots and broccoli.  Not the slightest bit oily and the star of the show. \n\nThose who are spoiled by dining at the established restaurants specializing in these dishes both in the cities and some amazing local establishments, may find International Noodles a step below those benchmarks.  However, this place is a reasonable alternative when something closer to home, or more casual is desired.  Everything comes in around $11. per dish, so it may present some savings compared to the local competition.\n\nJANUARY 28, 2016 - UPDATE:  This just in...The owners of International Noodles are not the same folks as the dearly departed Basil Leaf, nor Asiana.  New team in town!  The original \"Danny\" is now operating Lemongrass in Cherry Hill.",

In the middle of the last century it was about the only place to enjoy a sit down meal that wasn't grandma's house.  Those days have come and gone, and WFD has definitely seen its heyday pass it by.  Now, the center of town is coming back to life with new money and better ideas, while the old diner has yet to catch on to the new energy at the core of the city.  \n\nReally hope it can take its cues from the newer places nearby that are reinventing themselves and becoming pleasant and interesting joints for drinking and eating.  It would be a cultural shame to lose its place as the purveyor of huge plates of hash, flash and dash for the masses that it once was, and could be again with some new ideas.  \n\nWhen I was there earlier in the week for a quick breakfast, the first impression was of a place full of old folks both customers and staff.  It felt downright geriatric.  The countertop formica was worn and exhausted.  The equipment was several generations behind state of the art.  Dust and grime collected in the corners.  I felt a wave of fatigue overcome me before reaching the counter stool.  Coffee was required immediately.\n\nDespite the aging optics, my simple breakfast of Coffee and toasted Corn Muffin was quite satisfying.  The java was hot and brewed with decent enough beans to alert my buds to an awakening.  The Muffin was homemade and the largest I had seen in many years.  Yes. It was fresh and very tasty.  \n\nIts location is across Rt. 541 from the court, and thus very convenient for my early arrival to beat traffic approach to work.  I will return on occasion, and hope that they can examine the new places opening up in town and adopt new style and menu to keep up with the changing tastes of the new age.",

It is a light cake, which is fine, but I prefer a denser bottom that holds more flavor.  The real star of the show was the icing/frosting on top of the crown.  It was thick, rich, creamy, sweet, and good enough to lick off and relish.  Regardless of the flavor, it came through loud and clear.  They approach addictiveness.  \n\nOverall, the experience was a mixed blessing.  While the flavors of the icing were fun and engaging, the cake bottoms were pleasant, but forgettable.  The cost being richer than the frosting threw the balance off for me, and left me in the middle of the road.",

My order was taken by the husband, although his wife was also out front at times. They were both friendly, if not loquacious. The menu was large, with a backpage of luncheon special combo plates. I went with the Hunan Beef, which included cup of soup (wonton) and pork fried rice. \n\nIn my experience, Hunan style is a spicy cuisine that gets it heat from a fermented black bean sauce and secondarily, Szechuan chili peppers. This dish had neither, but instead seemed to be overloaded with straight black/white pepper and salt. It made me thirsty instantly. Although the beef was thinly sliced and tender, the sauce made it difficult to enjoy. On the other hand the beef stock in the wonton soup was better than average, the dumpling not too thick skinned and the meat filling, decent. The fried rice was a bit on the hard side and had seen better days. \n\nThis isn't in my neighborhood, and it is doubtful I would return given my first taste impressions. Obviously, they have succeeded all this time without my involvement, and they will no doubt continue to do so hereafter.",

After the new bagel place failed last year it became a forlorn strip of despair on this end of Trenton Road. Since, a new cupcake shop, Pizza Hut and Fat Jack's BBQ have opened their doors. Three course meal just by walking to these nearby stores. \n\nYesterday, son and I visited FJB for early dinner around 5:45. The place was empty, but for a couple at one of the tables. All ordering is done at the cashier, where we were handed paper three fold menus to peruse. There were a limited number of choices between pork, beef and chicken in standard smokehouse styles. The ribs were much more expensive than other items, and were not visible nor smellable and thus hard to choose without some evidence of excellence to tempt us. As first timers, we went to their sandwiches as the way to sample their kitchen skills. The Notorious P.I.G. for the tennager and The Devil's Own Burger for the old man. Fries are the regular accompaniment, but I selected their BBQ beans for a buck upcharge. \n\nWe sat at a table along the wood planked wall. It had three bottle rockets with their various sauces, although no ketchup for the fries. The PIG had a load of bacon, pork belly and pulled pork with a drizzle of maple syrup and scoop of coleslaw between the jaws of a decent roll. Son squirted a mix of their magic sauces and dug in. He seemed content with his meal, although mentioning he liked the BBQ in Virginia better. \n\nMy burger was creative with all the varieties of hot peppers and sauce thrown on top of the puck, bacon, cheddar and frizzled onion. Liked it, but the ground beef tasted far from fresh, and more likely a freezer occupant for a while. It cuddah been a contender had the meat been spared the ice dungeon. The beans were tart and savory despite being watery. \n\nThere is better BBQ to be had in the area (Mission), and even in Morrisville (Winckler's), but Fat Jack will do if you don't feel like more time driving. Jack could pick up some pointers from these other places on how to enhance the quality of the overall smoked meat experience.",

    "text": "Mexican Taste sits in the Mallard Creek Shopping Center in Richboro, PA. It is a small shop with about a dozen tables and minimal decorations. This was an Italian restaurant before, and the pizza ovens can be seen through the kitchen service window.  We made reservations for Wednesday evening, although it wasn't necessary as the house was not crowded. Service was provided by a lovely attentive young woman who handled everything in the front of the store. \n\nWe ordered the following: chorizo shrimp burrito, ground beef enchilada, steak fajitas and chicken flautas (an appetizer on the menu, but big enough for a meal).  Other traditional Mexican dishes like tortas, sopas, homemade horatcha drink and fresh whole fish were not on the menu.  Given the relative lack of Latin American population in this part of Bucks County, it is understandable that they limit their offerings more to the American palate. \n\nBy way of full disclosure, I work in New Jersey where the presence of Central Americans is far greater and the number of ethnic restaurants reflects the larger customer base.  Thus, those kitchens serve primarily a Hispanic audience, and provide deeper possibilities for quality plates from the homeland.  It would not be fair to directly compare these very different food sources. At the same time, it is impossible to not be cognizant of the similarities and differences.  \n\nWhile all of found our meals to be decent, none of us thought they were outstanding. The steak for the fajitas was ample, but a bit dry from overcooking. The sauces on each of our dinners were not spicy enough, an unnecessary concession to the stereotype that Gringos don't like spicy food. Au contraire - we like it a lot, and appreciate the challenge. The flautas were big and stuffed well with shredded chicken and cheese, but they would have been improved if there was more chili in the mix.  \n\nMexican taste is an okay introduction to Mexican food, but it could be so much more if they respected that their customers could handle the real deal, and the kitchen did not compromise on the true sabor Mexicana. \n\nJust do it!",

    "text": "Ariana's Pizzeria & Italian Restaurant on Levittown Parkway is a basic pizza parlor with booths and tables that seems primarily to toss and bake tomato pies and related sandwiches, calzones, wraps, etc., that can be found in most red sauce establishments. They also have a short list of dinners and entrees that looked appealing on the menu. \n\nWe were all hungry and took the chance on the bigger (more expensive) meals, rather than the safer sandwich route. To some extent we regretted that decision. Each came with small side salad, heated torpedo rolls and butter, and a bed of pasta under the chicken offerings. Salad was fine. Bread hot and crusty, and spaghetti copious. \n\nProblem was that while the marsala was decent with a nice load of fresh mushrooms in a sauce closely resembling what it should be, the Ricci and Abbruzzio chicken dishes were not quite right.  The Ricci lacked much flavor despite the load of sauce and melted mozza, and a corner of the pasta was much cooler than the rest of the platter, like it had been sitting too long far from the stove. A little red and black pepper in the mix while cooking would have made a big difference. The Abbruzzio with the large bore pasta looked great, but the chicken was overcooked and tough, and the sauce flavor, AWOL.\n\nI was overall content with my dinner, but the fact that my family ate so little of their's reflected the reviews they would write if asked. We took the leftovers home to see with we could improve them with a little doctoring. Yet, at more than $15 per dish, we were unhappy with our choices and the abilities in the kitchen. \n\nTeaches us to go out to eat hungry. Definitely clouded our judgment on how to attack the menu. \n\n2.5 STARS",

    "text": "If you enjoy throwback mid-twentieth century breakfasts and lunches, you really should give Sneddon's Luncheonette a visit. In the middle of Bridge Street in the Jersey Delaware River town of Lambertville, it is an excellent example of counter centered food service just as it was 70 years ago.  Formica countertop, a dozen spinners, open grill kitchen, and lovely ladies pouring joe and slinging hash up and down the line. Sneddon's is one of those places where you really can eat the atmosphere. \n\nMy morning stop to break my fast included several cups of hot java from the Bunn-O-Matic, and a short stack of french toast, served in tandem by two women who were straight from central casting. No extra charge for the charming small talk. There were three egg toast alternatives on the board, and I chose the standard white bread dipper, so to start with the basics and hopefully work my way up the list.  \n\nGotta say, that the FT was the weakest element of the experience. I watched as the cook put the bread in a bowl of whipped egg and dropped them onto the hot steel.  He was multi-tasking and could have been more attentive to my space on the grill. What I received were two very eggy slices of Wonder Bread, where a lot of the egg was still on the surface, and had not completely absorbed into the center of the bread.  Given how thin they were, the absence of moist egg in the core was surprising (and a disappointment). It wasn't bad, and the melted butter and syrup certainly made the experience okay, but it could have been much more with a little more TLC in the preparation. \n\nStill, I enjoyed the experience of finally getting to this institution.  Service was fun, the coffee was hot and ample, and the room itself like eating in a museum.  I was told the breakfast sandwiches and corn beef hash were stars, and will give them both a try on my next visit.",

No doubt, however, that both listings are active on Yelp, despite the fact that they seem to be paying for advertising as Little Basil only. \n\nNot that this approach to advertising changes anything about their cuisine. It is the same two table China house offering Thai options in addition to the traditional Sino/American fare. I liked their general's chicken and egg roll lunch deal. Better than some; not as good as others.

Of course, alot of that depends on the quality of the work and comfort of the facilities. \n\nRelax Foot Massage on Bustleton Avenue in the far Northeast Philly does a decent job on the tootsies in a dark room with large adjustable easy chairs, but not quite the same level of attention to detail on the arms, shoulders and back; making for a somewhat disjointed experience. I enjoyed the hot soak with Tibetan herbal salts, and found the poking, probing and stretching after that to be comprehensive and satisfying. Those were a full 30 minutes of occasional pain and moments of intense serenity. \n\nThe upper body work seemed more inconsistent, with varying pressure applied to the left and right appendages. My masseuse often didn't complete the application of force evenly on the muscles and ligaments - she would push down but not all the way, and rush to the next spot with adequate firmness at times, yet without the same degree of strength the next. I became very aware of what she was doing and it stopped me from really relaxing into that Zen zone where real healing takes place, and I cease being aware of where I am (not sleep, but close). \n\nI liked the darkened room, which felt more private than the other place I often go where the big hall is light and a little noisy, but the overall skill of the Chinese men and women attendants higher than here.\n\nGiven the prices are the same, I will choose the healing hands over the shadow ambiance and continue with my long term spa until someplace better comes along.",

And, more meat. \n\nThis is heaven if home cooked roast beef, roast pork, meatballs, sausage sandwiches/platters in any combination (read, pepperoni), is your dietary preference.  If it's not, then you're plumb out of luck.  \n\nSandy's is an unabashedly meaty place, in a dark tavern with HDTVs on every wall.  It sits in the middle of that small strip center out front of Oxford Valley Mall, facing Route 1.  The unique part of the experience here is that the meats are actually cooking and prepared for serving at the bar.  You can sit almost anywhere in the house and watch the steam table being opened and your order being set up in a torpedo roll or on a plate.  That's pretty cool.  \n\nThey also give you a ton of meat with every dish.  Our roast pork sandwich was overflowing the loaf and spilling onto the plate.  The meatball sub had four nice sized spheres topped with a good tomato sauce.  Both were totally cooked into submissive tenderness, and had good taste.  The pork needed a little kicker if a more spicy finish was desired.  The meatballs were good just as they were.  The only real weakness was the quality of the roll.  They lacked any body and were quickly overcome by the moisture of the meat, turning soggy and difficult to handle fairly quickly.  The fork was invented for just such circumstances, and ours were put to good use.  The positive was that were ended up eating most of the meat without the bread, and saved those calories. \n\nUsed them up on the dark, cold, slow Guinness. Ahhh....perfect complement. \n\nSandy's is CASH ONLY, with a captive ATM on the premises.",

In its place is Richman's Ice Cream & Burger, a sibling of the joint just off 5 Points on Bristol Emilie Road, Levittown, PA. The menu is identical, but the dining possibilities are much more limited. This location has no indoor dining area, but only round or picnic tables under too small umbrellas, that neither cast enough shade to protect from the sun, nor sufficient cover to hold the rain at bay. So, in a downpour or a drizzle the only real choices are to go home, eat in the car, or get wet. \n\nI was handed a bag at the side window with a traditional burger (single patty, lettuce, onion, thousand island dressing, standard bun), hot dog (w mustard, ketchup, relish and hash on separated bun), fries and orange cream shake. All I can say is,\n\nNever again.\n\nBy the time I was at the kitchen table 20 minutes later, this is what I retrieved from the sack: 1 hot dog so overloaded that with one bite it fell apart, spilling its contents on the floor. The bun had lost its stamina and become two soggy pieces of bread. The burger retained it's texture despite giving up its heat. The dressing and lettuce were lubricants, expelling contents with each cold bite. The fries had morphed into soggy pasty worms. Only the shake was a semblance of its former self and was pretty good, tasting like a creamcicle.\n\nLesson learned. Only hit up this Richman's on a nice day, and consume everything right on the premises to capture the promise that is an otherwise excellent burger joint. Although reading Jarrad R's review makes it seem eating there might not really solve the problem.",

Yet, the kitchen remains inconsistent despite the more upscale menu and corresponding prices. \n\nMy son and I stopped in earlier this week to enjoy some time together before he returned to school. We had alot to talk about. We were given the table right beneath the large blackboard specials menu where they were advertising Steak Night. That moved the young man to order a New York Strip and frite, medium rare. Nice move. I went with one of their burgers with Gouda and \"Million $$$ Bacon,\" medium, with garlic mashed rather than fries. Pineville at its best had always been a great burger house and I imagined our reunion after several years would be best served by honoring that memory. \n\nIt didn't quite work out that way this night. \n\nWhile the steak looked and smelled awesome and kept my son entertained from first to last red juicy bite, my classic puck arrived far closer to well done than medium that not even liberally spread ketchup could revive, and the mashed tasted more of salt than garlic. I managed to eat half knowing it would be devoured when my son regained his appetite in the morning. Still, there was no denying my disappointment. \n\nThe dinner was saved by the spectacular homemade Rice Pudding (w whipped cream) that Pineville is also famous for. It hadn't lost any of its seductive taste - cool, chunky, mildly sweet with a nice cinnamon powdered finish. Served in a large coffee mug, it overran it's confines into the saucer beneath. We were careful to capture every last drop. Simply wonderful! \n\nThe night would have been five star if we began and ended with dessert, but the road to that perfection was paved with poor execution.

It replaced an old luncheonette, and has done a decent renovation to give it a darker ambient feel. Perhaps, too much narrow gauge siding and flooring, but don't blame them for saving money where they could. \n\nThe menu is long on sushi, sashimi and rolls, with a tip of the cap to Chinese and Thai cuisine. So, it's not really a fusion house, but wants to appeal to the fish phobes with a little something more palatable to them. Problem is, that seldom works, and those few offerings are poor relations to the primary actors. That appears to be the case here. More confusion than fusion. \n\nSo, I went with the salmon teriyaki bento box - 2 small pink fish fillets in a good sauce, 2 gyoza, 6 piece California roll and white rice. The salmon was pleasantly crunchy, the gaozi fried with a chicken filling, and ordinary Cali's. All reasonably satisfying, but nothing more spectacular.

I ripped it open and pulled out the styro box and little plastic cups of fresh, chunky salsa.  I dumped them on top of the two dough pockets.  They looked very nice together.  Still, it would have been nice if they gave me a fork or other utensil with which to consume my lunch.  Fingers would have to suffice.  \n\nBoth were very good.

Liked them both, and would certainly expand my horizons by sampling the other stuffings.  \n\nShould they see fit to serve their eat-in customers with a bit more hospitality, by throwing in real plates and functional flatware and even a few more tables and chairs to eat in house, Pizza Express could find itself in a fortunate cycle of improved ratings.  Right now, the priority is take out. Understandable, but the value of folks finding and sticking to your place is only enhanced when they can hang around to enjoy their grub.",

    "text": "DELIVERED LUNCH REVIEW :\n\nOnce a month I go to Norristown, PA, for an office meeting. Lunch is eaten in the conference room as we talk. It is routinely ordered from Rocco's the morning of the get together. The entire menu is in play. To date, I have gone with two of their salads and a hot eggplant Parmesan sandwich. The others around the table have sampled other things, with personal size pizza a standard option. \n\nNow, it is not fair to rate take out or delivered meals the same way you do for those eaten in the restaurant. They can't be as good after packaging, cooling, crushing and sitting around for a while. (Yelp should consider a check off that makes this clear.) Still, this is part of the dining experience and should be part of learning about the vendor. \n\nAfter these three experiences, I no longer order salads because I find them too past their prime upon consumption, even with the salad dressing applied just before eating. Just not very enjoyable. However, the grinder wrapped in foil and paper, although somewhat diminished in transport, retained its heat and flavor to a large extent. Yes, the torpedo roll had already lost its verve, but it kept its structural integrity, and was a solid handhold throughout the meal. The condensation as it cools has to go somewhere, and the bread is the only absorbing surface. It was a fair trade off for a tasty sammy, although I wouldn't say the same for the limp pizzas I have seen falling apart on the way to the bocca. \n\nObviously, I am not a delivery fan, but sometimes it is necessary. Rocco's does what it can to make everyone happy with what arrives from their shop. I suspect cold hoagies are the way to go, and I will order one next month, and report back to you. \n\nMangia bene!",

    "text": "Oaks Family Restaurant in Pipersville, PA, is a roadside caf\u00e9 specializing in breakfast/brunch/lunch for the folks of upper Bucks County. It sits on Easton Road (Rt. 611) about ten miles north of Doylestown. It has a country vibe, with small counter with half dozen spinners, and a dining room to one side with about a dozen tables. \n\nWhen I arrived earlier this week, the place was buzzing mostly with guys shooting the s*^t about local and current events. I found a stool at the end of the counter next to the cash register and plopped down for my morning meal. The servers were friendly and engaging; handing me a menu and taking my drink order promptly. Coffee with milk, por favor. I chose french toast based on the recommendation of the lady taking my order.\n\nI won't hold that against her, but the egged fry bread left much to be desired. Although a thin sliced loaf, the center of the bread was dry because it had not been dipped long enough in the egg mix before frying. Too, I couldn't taste any vanilla or cinnamon, nor was there any caramelization of sugar from the hot steel. It seemed each slice had an egg skirt around it from where the mix had splashed down with the bread on the grill. I'm not a forensic chef, but there was evidence of lack of attentiveness in the kitchen. The result, a disappointing performance, and a lost opportunity to make a strong positive first impression. \n\nThe coffee was fine, and service, sterling. Still, when the star of the show doesn't come through for the audience, it is hard to give a standing ovation.\n\n2.5 STARS",

    "text": "I did Thai takeout at South Seas on York Road, Abington, PA, today, and gotta say I was somewhat disappointed. No issue negotiating the narrow driveway alongside the orange faced shop to reach the small parking lot in the rear, nor dealing with the staff inside picking up my order of Tom Kha Soup and Drunken Noodles (veggie). No, the problem was strictly the content of the food when I got home to consume it.\n\nNeatly packed in leak proof containers and brown paper handled bag, it was fun to unload and helped build anticipation. The coconut soup had all the right ingredients and was as spicy as desired. Fresh mushrooms floating on top with carrot, string bean, broccoli, tofu and  chunks of ginger and long fibrous lemongrass lurking beneath the surface like gators in a muddy milky river.\n\n Therein lay the problem. Love the bite of lemongrass and the tartness of ginger, but not when there is so much of it that it outweighs the edibles in the bowl. I tried chewing them to extract the flavor since there was so much of it, but the tough hard texture proved daunting, and I surrendered before putting a splinter in my gums or cracking a tooth. \n\nAside from that, the taste of the actual soup was good. \n\nThe Drunken was a large portion, but of middle width, rather than the broad rice pasta it is supposed to be. Narrower gauge means less surface area to hold the essential spicy sauce, and much less chew, which is key to the tactile experience of this dish. Too, the exact same veggies in the soup were in this melange, but not very much of them. The proportion of noodles to greens was off, with far too little of the crunchys, and way too heavy on the carbs, making the ensemble denser and drier than it should have been, without the joy of hot noodles glistening from the devilish sauce.\n\nThai Spicy, yes. Thai balanced, 'fraid not. \n\nIt just didn't work very well, and had me questioning who was cooking behind the Covid masks. Maybe that was why the shop looked like Chinese takeout, without any element of Siam decor. Nary a Buddha nor elephant in sight. \n\n2.5 STARS",

    "text": "Gianni's Pizza is a backdoor walkout Italian house on the bottom floor of an much larger and older building on Bustleton Pike in Richboro, Pa.  The fit out is smallish, and has the feel of a nicely finished basement.  The menu has the usual suspects of most pizza parlors, the service is friendly, and the prices amazingly low.  \n\nWe sat in a booth in the newly painted dining area.  It was comfortable, if a bit tight.  We ordered the Old Fashioned Tomato Pie with Mushrooms and the Chicken Parm dinner, with the intention of sharing both.  No problem getting them served at the same time.  The dinner came with a house salad and pasta.  The greens were a basic romaine mix with a few red onion shavings, cherry tomatoes, cukes, and a standard balsamic.  It was cool and refreshing.  \n\nThe Chicken Parm plate at $10.99 was what the cost implied.  Prefab chicken breast patties covered in sauce and mozza.  Not bad, but not all that tasty.  The side of penne with aglio olio was better, but needed more garlic to really announce itself.  The Tomato Pie had a thicker airy crust, perhaps to hold the weight of the too loose sauce topside. The wetness above caused the bottom layer to get soggy, and impossible to pick up without a tomato slide.  It was a situation where less would have been more.  Keep the sauce thicker and chunkier, and the moisture would not have been an issue.  In fact, we brought most of it home and re-baked it the next day, and produced the right texture and flavor.  \n\nThis place has some nice things going for it with location, ambiance and service, but our sampling of the food suggested that perhaps in the attempt to keep prices low they sacrificed some of the finer points of Italian cooking.  \n\nThere are better choices around if looking for good food from the boot.",

    "text": "Lena's Deli on Main Street in Yardley, Pa., is a miniature charcuterie that is very attractive with outdoor patio seating in front, and sincerely and competent ownership/management in house.  Their thing is first rate deli lunches from soup through dessert, that are designed to be a step above the norm.  \n\nGenerally, they succeed in that premise, but my experience exposed a few weaknesses in their execution.  I ordered their Turkey, Swiss, Saut\u00e9ed Spinach and Roasted Red Pepper sandwich on Sesame Seeded Italian/French loaf.  Everything looked terrific being put together, and the anticipation excited my tastebuds.  I took it to my office for eating a few hours later.  \n\nWhen I opened the paper wrapping, I saw that the sandwich had not been fully enclosed in the aluminum foil sheet.  Because the bread was so wide and cut in half, most of it was not sealed, but open to the elements.  The result was a less than fresh bread and contents, that was already losing taste and crunch.  Still, it was a huge sandwich for the $10+ (with a side of slaw), and I could only eat half that day.  What I consumed still had a decent, and somewhat unusual flavor due to the more exotic ingredients.  \n\nI retrieved the balance from the refrigerator the next day.  Whatever the chemical process involved overnight, the spinach had become too bitter to eat.  I lifted the top side and scraped it and the peppers off.  The remainder of the day old was okay, but certainly had lost its lust for life.  There is always some degradation to a unfinished sandwich, and I don't hold Lena to account for that.  However, the bad taste of the greens, even with refrigeration, was a disappointment.  \n\nSpending more for an exceptional lunch is worthwhile, but when it can't survive to the next day, the value proposition is lacking.  Lesson learned.  Make sure it is properly packaged, and eat it as soon as served.  The first is a matter of quality control.  The second, of knowing true shelf life.",

By my taste, DeLo's has one of the best pies I have eaten, and I have been a fan of theirs for more than 30 years. So, coming to Yardley Pizza for the next slices really puts them in a bad place.  Apologies before I go any further.\n\nAnyway, the floor plan is quite nice. Bigger than expected inside, and comfortably casual with sufficient space between tables for a private conversation.  The staff is friendly and helpful.  Tuesday is Dollar Slice Day (I didn't know), so the price was right! The two plain slices I had were fairly typical of the American Pizzeria.  Triangular cuts with decent, if thin, sauce and mass produced cheese.  A little oil on the surface, but not enough for a big drip. \n\nAlas, the slices were quite ordinary in every respect. Nothing to sit up and take notice about, but certainly a better than average competent American slice of pizza.  The crust held up well, and did not droop under the weight of the toppings.  The bite held its crunch to the very last.  It was only the sauce and cheese that missed the mark.  Again, not bad, but not eye-opening. \n\nAs I said, DeLo's is a very difficult act to follow.",

    "text": "Finally made it to Dim Sum Garden. \n\nLocated mid-street on Race, it is a deep and narrow space with a step up half way back at the kitchen and mini-bar area.  One wall is slate, and the other smooth with the image of a huge dumpling adorning the wall.  That same design is emblazoned on the black T's worn by the wait staff.  I wouldn't mind wearing one of those.  \n\nEntering solo around 7:30, the tables were buzzing, but not SRO.  I was pointed to a deuce in the front window, and quickly choose to look inward rather than out toward the street.  If I was in a metaphorical mood that might mean something.  It seems natural to want to enjoy the floorshow.  The menu arrived promptly with a glass of water (cold, not hot), and a few minutes later the server returned to direct me through the offerings.  I knew I wanted the Xiao Long Bao (#1) because that what was most people raved about, but I also wanted a second dish - selecting Eggplant with Garlic Sauce as counterpoint.    \n\nPart of the schtick here is the servers offer to show you how to eat XLB.  For the uninitiated there is a learning curve and the risk of spraying scalding broth onto your neighbors, so there is some reason for caution.  Mild dexterity in the use of chopsticks and flat bottom spoon in tandem is required, but once mastered the manipulation becomes part of the fun.  Even life long experts can be seen chasing escaped dumplings across the table, so there is no fear of lost face.  \n\nI was surprised that the XLB were not as good as I expected.  Their dough was thicker than I have had in the famous Shanghai dumpling shops.  True, the pork filling was substantial and decent, and the steaming soup within pretty good, but they were disappointing nonetheless. Even the \"Dumpling Sauce\" on the tables was not quite right to my palate.  It used a vinegar that too strongly neutralized the flavor of the broth.  There was no ginger to mix with the vinegar. I had to mix the hot chili oil with the sauce on the plate to get to the heat I wanted to supplement the taste.  The second dish was good Eggplant with Garlic Sauce.  I asked for it \"hot,\" and upon arrival it glistened from the oil it cooked in.  I liked it, but added still more chili to bring up the burn.  \n\nI will certainly return to Dim Sum Garden as there is much more coming out of the kitchen that looks interesting, and because so many of my friends love the place.  It calls itself, \"Philly's Premier Authentic Shanghai Soup Dumpling Restaurant.\"  Who am I to question a marketing slogan, but if you say it, you should be able to back it up.  \n\nI don't think it did.",

Bins full of rounders appear smaller than my last Manhattan visit a few years ago (Clearly not real Manhattan Island bagels that are often larger than a saucer in diameter.) Still, my onion, butter and swiss had decent texture, loads of onion flakes and a good bite. Their coffee could stand a better bean roaster and more choices. \n\nService suffered from understaffing. There was one woman taking orders and working the griddle, making for a hectic burnout shift for her, and growing queue. When the owner/manager came out from the back, and put on plastic gloves, things got better, but he was not well trained in food prep, so the butter spread was uneven, and only a single slice of cheese was placed within - where a minimum of two is the normal allocation, and often more. Too, the transection did not completely separate the halves, so when one side was lifted, the other tagged along and fell apart. \n\nI attributed that to having a bad morning.",

This is the third incarnation for this rear entranced bar and grill. It is attractive with vaulted ceilings, tall glass, and substantial rectangular bar. Plenty of wood and windows all around. \n\nI liked my vantage point at the corner of the bar facing a kitchen door and HDTV. The beer taps were to my left. I appreciated being given samples of a couple of their brews when I seemed indecisive. I chose the Mango Cart, an obviously fruity beer that had a mildly sour mango flavor and beautiful yellow gold luster. Well worth the $6 pint. \n\nMy classic cheeseburger was okay, but missed on its requested endpoint, coming out well done rather than medium. Too, the ground beef crumbled as bitten, giving the impression that it may have been frozen for a while before hitting the hot steel. Perhaps that explains why pink centers weren't an option. It would have been fine as an $8 puck, but at $11, plus $2 for the homemade potato chip swap from fries, it was overpriced.  Service was friendly and prompt. \n\nPlenty of sports available on the multitude of screens, and was fortunate to watch Tiger Woods win the Masters for the first time in thirteen years.

Service is friendly and efficient.  Apologies were sincere when advised that they were out of Bun Bo Hue before 8 pm.  I settled on another option (Pho Tai), and was very satisfied with that large bowl.  Superior broth, strong noodle mound properly cooked, and plenty of beef and accoutrements. Definitely on the high end of the satisfaction scale.\n\nYet, the Summer Rolls were a bit disappointing.  The Shrimp appeared to be sliced so thin that they could not be tasted along with the other ingredients.  That, and the cool skin of the wrap was too close to room temp, thus deprived of the coolness of the app.  The Peanut Sauce was adequate, but thinner than most.  \n\nThe house was three quarters full this Saturday evening, and the HDTVs were showing college football games.  \n\nThe Pho hit the spot, but everything else seemed a step below top quality, and exhausting the Bun Bo Hue so early was certainly a strategic blunder.  \n\nWith all the other excellent options for Vietnamese cuisine in the area, there is no compulsion to return to Pho Saigon anytime soon.",

Corona will do nicely, thank you. \n\nThe space was a rainbow of colored walls and furniture.  The carved wood backs of the dinner chairs were painted brightly, and the distressed wood tables felt like those I had sat at throughout the southwest and Mexico.  The atmosphere transported me out of Bucks and into Santa Fe, Tucson or maybe, Cancun.  It was an easy trip. \n\nThe chips and salsa arrived promptly and I had a quick taste. Hard and crisp shovels for spicy chunky sauce.  Satisfactory, but perhaps not the best I've had.  I was content to wait for the Chicken Flautas, which arrived with a light melted cheesy cover over three stuffed flutes.  Rice and Refried Beans on a separate plate worked well together. I poured the remaining salsa over the flautas to achieve max flavor, and dug in.  \n\nThe tubes were full of large chunks of white meat chicken, beans, cheese, and a few sliced poblanos.  Everything was well cooked and placed in the oven to bring everything to melting temperature.  Very tasty and filling.  Totally enjoyable. \n\nWhy only 3 Stars?  Well, I had to ask for slices of lime for the Corona.  The Salsa was decent, but tasted ubiquitously the same as most store bought varieties, when a homemade approach might have offered something more uniquely their own.  The melted white cheese sauce was a bit too mild, and poured too freely over everything, where  more \"kick\" would have been more distinguishing.  These are not serious shortcomings, as the dish remained enjoyable. Still, to be fan-worthy or more, there should be something original or memorable about the experience. \n\nI will definitely return to look for that special something, and when I find it, the stars will shine brightly.",

The house in Huntington Valley on County Line Road looks like most other dineresque large menu emporiums, with the important distinction that although not kosher in the kitchen, it still offers many ethnic dishes for Jewish tastebuds that easily remind we of that faith of our nanny's cooking. Matzo ball soup, potato pancakes, blintzes, pastrami, knishes, pumpernickel sandwiches, white fish salad, salami, borscht and my personal favorite, matzo brie.

Still, my matzo brie was pretty good, and I was glad I asked the server to add saut\u00e9ed onions to the mix. It arrived a huge platter of jumbled matzo pieces, egg and onion, scrambled to a semi-dry state.  My partners in crime seemed to enjoy their egg/potato/toast dishes, but spoke more of the quantity than the quality. I tasted a bit of everything. It was all very okay. \n\nWhile I wouldn't rush back to Ben & Irv's, it is good to know it is there when I need a quick Jewish fix to connect me to my people via traditional comfort food.",

Nonetheless, there are some things that I still prefer to touch and feel before purchasing, and computers are one of them. I need to be sure I know what I am getting and can really do what I want with the equipment. ( I know I am showing my age here). \n\nThis BB is closest to home, and has become my showroom for the electronics I need. I find they have an adequate selection, knowledgeable staff, and the time to answer my questions.  Too, their financing can be reasonable when using their credit card, with zero interest if paid in full within 18 months. That can be handy on the larger business purchases.  For a while, I would only educate myself there, and then buy online.  I found that this did not work well for me and there was a level of disconnect caused by not having asked all the necessary questions, and then having to deal with the manufacturer's websites - usually a disaster.  So, I decided it was better to just go ahead and buy what I needed there once I had decided what that was.  It might cost a few sheckels more, but the total experience was more satisfactory.  I admit to also suffering minor guilt when BB went through bankruptcy/reorganization and came close to closing its doors permanently.  \n\nI thought of a world without a place where I could touch a product and talk to someone face to face who knew a lot more about it then I did, and whether I really wanted to contribute to that eventuality, even in a minimal way.  I decided to cast my vote (and spend my dollar) to maintain a retail market system that offered this alternative.  Somehow, it just seemed a more humane future.",

Yet, there are times using them becomes necessary because the local shops are closed, or just don't have the universal inventory of HD. \n\nLike most men I start to feel intoxicated when facing floor to ceiling tools, hardware, paint, lumber, you name it.  It is amazing what I can convince myself I need when walking up and down the aisles. You mean I don't already have a long handled hammer to extend my reach and leverage?  How can I live any longer without one? Gotta have it!  Right gents?\n\nSo, I found myself there yesterday with my son who needed two cans of spray paint for a 6th grade school project and had waited to mention it until after my Newtown Hardware House was closed for the night.  I felt the tug of the tidal wave sensation of all that great stuff.  After 10 minutes evaluating the Rust O Leum , more time picking up some light bulbs, and perusing that long handled blaster (all at good prices), we left the airplane hanger.  \n\nI was so drunk from hardware overload I had to let my son drive home.",

It is a tiny shop in an old strip on Jacksonville Road.  Parking is limited and difficult to negotiate.  However, the Dogs are worth the effort.  You can get them as you like them, and fix 'em up with the extra relishes, peppers and table rockets full of mustard and ketchup.  They are all beef, and the rolls have good body and size to fit and hold the extra sauerkraut piled high on top.  When I was finished with my squirts and slices, I could still close the bun and bite into the creation without leakage.  That is a major plus, as there are no tables in the shop now, and I was relegated to eating in my car on this cold Saturday afternoon.  No fuss. No muss. \n\nThe only downsides are the aforementioned parking, lack of seating, and the use of styro packaging.  To save the planet, I would have been happier with a thick paper rollup, and paper towels rather than the thin napkins that require a handful to be effective. \n\nStill, this is a frankfurter lovers' haven.  If you lust for one sometimes, a place like Denny's can be your port of entry to the Sea of Tranquility. \n\nGo ahead.  You know you want one.",

There must be one cookbook they all work out of, or a convention they all attend to get the same items on every menu around the continent. Still, Panda Garden is on the higher end of the quality spectrum even if the output is fairly much the ubiquitous fare we all know. I have had the Wonton Soup who's broth is above average; the various Chicken and Sauces, which are solid, but uninspired and sometimes overcooked; and the Noodle dishes and Foo Youngs, which are also acceptable. Just nothing to write home about unless you are having a very boring day and feel homesick. \n\nIf you find yourself in this part of Bucks County this choice is as good as you are going to find.

It still has the look and feel of a Jersey diner, but with the added sheen of new lighting, a bar, and HDTVs around the house.  They still have a counter and appear to either bake or have access to beautiful pastries in the front display.  Glad they made the effort to come back after a stretch of bad luck.  \n\nI stopped in for breakfast after a short court appearance and took a spinner near the kitchen door.  My server was friendly, attractive, and training someone in the finer points of Jersey diner etiquette (You know, how and when to say, \"Hun,\" \"Doll,\" \"Sweetheart,\" and, \"You want fries with that.\")  As a result I had excellent attention paid to my coffee cup and overall satisfaction.  I ordered the old reliable Sausage, Egg & Cheese on Kaiser breakfast sandwich, and was offered the choice of hash browns or fresh fruit on the side.  I went juicy. \n\nMy meal arrived on a large white plate, with the sandwich bisected and pinned together with long wooden spikes.  There were two pork sausage links, two scrambled eggs and a solitary slice of American cheese under the hood.  I should have asked about the meat, as I prefer patty to wurst in these creations.  Still, there was plenty of food, and everything was fresh and tasty (although the cheese was lost in the melee).  The roll was one of those white bread deals, where it is shaped like a roll, but tastes like plain white.  Maybe, if toasted it would have had more verve.  Due to the weight of the sausage and its slick skin, I soon discovered that every bite led to something slipping out the back door.  I switched from manual to fork and knife to control the losses, and keep them from landing in my lap.  \n\nI had three refills of my coffee and plenty of the milk I requested in a small stainless pitcher.  The java was pretty good. \n\nAll in all, a decent breakfast, but not the homerun I was hoping for.",

This location is a satellite of the primary Vietnamese area on Washington Avenue, and it was a smart move to get to this place before the big money arrived to gentrify the neighborhood.  \n\nThe house itself is very similar to most of the other Vietnamese kitchens, in that it has a large floor plan with basic amenities; designed more like a cafeteria than a comfortable hang around restaurant.  Tables and chairs are utilitarian and are appropriate for the speed service provided by the friendly staff.  The menu covers a broad cross section of VN cuisine, from Pho and Bun to Vermicelli and Broken Rice dishes.  Prices are reasonable in light of the probable rent on the property.  It is easy to get completely stuffed for less than $10.  \n\nWhile I normally start an exploration of a new Vietnamese house with a bowl of Pho, I broke out of the mold by ordering Broken Rice with Grilled Chicken for a lunch entre, and an app of Summer Rolls.  My companion went with a Vermicelli plate that included a sampling of Shrimp, Pork, Beef, Tofu, and a Fried Spring Roll.  \n\nEverything was good, but the most memorable pieces of our meals were the Grilled Pork and Shrimp, and the Spring Roll.  They were tasty and brought smiles to our faces.  The rest was decent, but no better than the fare offered by most other shops.  I found the butterflied Chicken Thigh to be a touch under marinated and undercooked.  Thus, the skin and thicker aspects of the meat were not right for consumption. A few more minutes on the grill would have solved this.  Copious squirts of Sriracha and Hoisin helped.  \n\nI will come back to try the soups which have received praise.",

This shop opened a few months ago, emerging from a fire that destroyed an earlier Italian deli/restaurant. \"White\" is the overall sense when walking in.  Everything appears clean, and the kitchen area is open for all to see, and everything appears orderly.\nThe Hoagies come in three sizes, but the middle range, 9\"er is the most popular and has the sesame seeds on top.  The others are \"signature wheat rolls.\"\n\nMy first bite was of a Turkey Schwartzie, which is Sliced Turkey Breast, Swiss Cheese, Cole Slaw & Russian Dressing.  It was very good.  The sesame could be tasted immediately, followed quickly by the turkey, cole slaw, Swiss cheese, with the sweetness of the Russian Dressing acting like a final note of completion. \n\nI thought I could handle the 9\" for lunch, but I gave up at half time.  It was very filling.  So, it was really two lunches at a reasonable price. \n\nThe menu has lots of interesting options.

As a take away joint the place gets passing grades for consistency, speed, and quantity/quality.  The same cannot be said for dining in, where although there are 6 tables, the space is unattractive, poorly maintained, and without effective air conditioning on a hot summer day.  \n\nThe Wonton Soup I ordered with my lunch special was the same as in so many other houses of this ilk.  Chicken consume out of a can with thick skinned Wontons and some sort of meat-food within.  The Sesame Chicken was pretty average, but there was plenty for lunch.  The sauce while gloopy, still had the expected sweet taste that is used on almost all similar dishes.  The Fried Rice was made en mass in the morning (or the day before), and was dark from the beef stock it had absorbed, although it had a fair amount of veggies and pork chunks. \n\nFor me it was what I expected - unimaginative and strictly by the numbers cooking.  If you like this style then no harm coming here.  However, if you prefer something more authentically Chinese, one of the best places in Mercer County is right up Nottingham Way at Szechuan House.  \n\nThese two places are as different as night and day.

The dish would have been amazing if brought hot and steaming.  Apparently, the Blueberry Sauce and Maple Syrup were not heated before being poured over the pancakes, or placed on the table, and as a result cooled dramatically while awaiting transport by our server.  The ingredients were first rate, and even cooled had a wonderful taste.  Still, a cool pancake is not optimal for best experience. \n\nI took the opportunity to talk with the chef to explain what had happened, and suggested the sauces and syrups be heated before use to be sure everything arrived ready for peak consumption.  He was gracious and appreciative for the information. I believe this oversight will be easily corrected.  \n\nLuna Caf\u00e9 has a lot of promise.

    "text": "This is the TGI Fridays that is within the campus of Oxford Valley Mall, Langhorne (Middletown), Pa. It has the conventional layout of the older version of this national franchise, with a large bar and booths/tables all around.  The atmosphere is casual and bustling, and has the feel of the roadhouse it was meant to be. \n\nWe chose this spot as representative of contemporary popular American cuisine for our friends who had just arrived from Asia. They wanted something traditionally American.  What is better than nachos, burgers, salad, fried chicken and chicken/shrimp combos on top of pasta?  \n\nDon't answer that! \n\nWe had about a 10 minute wait for seating on a busy Saturday night.  Service was friendly and acceptably prompt given the crowd.  Our server was patient as we perused, translated and sought direction from our guests.  The youngest had no problem finding the fried chicken sandwich.  The mother and grandmother were slower in understanding meals without rice, but ultimately selected a traditional cheeseburger, and a grilled chicken pasta dish.  Of course, there was also the issue about western utensils vs. chopsticks, but we worked through that with the help of the large wooden spikes used to hold things together.  We natives moved more quickly to the salads, sliders and shrimp/chicken plates. \n\nEverything was served together, and I watched as our friends took their first close up look at American food.  It was a cross between confusion and incredulousness. Big pieces. Nothing cut into small bite size morsels. Okay. They would just have to figure it out and dig in.  The rest of us went quickly to work on our Jack Sliders (very good), BBQ chicken salad (plentiful and tasty), chicken/shrimp combo (loved the shrimp, but left most of the chicken to take home). The fried chicken sandwich was devoured with relish.  So far. So good. Our second oldest guest just ate the fries around the burger.  She didn't seem to know where to begin.  I think she did not want to use her hands to pick up her food.  I asked if she would like to exchange a small slider for her half pounder, and she gratefully accepted.  She ate it with the spike holding the entire thing like a burger on a stick.  She liked it.  Her burger was pretty good, but a step below what I have sampled in places like Chilis or Applebees. It was not the medium finish requested, but far closer to well done. Granny was able to eat her pasta with the spike, but seemed tentative the whole way.  It wasn't the noodles she was accustomed to, but she was game. \n\nAll in all, it was a fairly good introduction to fast casual, something almost totally lacking in their part of Asia. They were impressed by the size of the crowd, and its diversity.  \n\nWelcome to America, sisters!  You aren't in homogenous Asia any more.  You'll love it once you figure it all out.",

With 30 foot ceilings and housewares stacked to that peak, walking through the narrow isles gives a sense of claustrophobia and strained neck.  Everyone is funneled through the counterclockwise flow of the warehouse, with side trips down tributaries to find the particular thing you need.  \n\nThis feeling of being overwhelmed by the canyons and islands makes for an unpleasant experience.  It is true that the \"one stop\" nature of the store has benefits, and that the ability to examine multiple towel options, or alternate coffee making technologies, is educational.  Yet, the sheer verticality of the space is ever-present and unpleasant. Compare to Home Depot with similar floor to near- ceiling merchandise. There, the aisles are wider and there is a better proportional scale. There is no feeling that a towel slide could wipe you out.\n\nMaybe their next gen factories will be more appealing.",

While I didn't walk in with fond memories of my past visit, my son was in the mood for hot wings, and BWW certainly had plenty of those.  \n\nTruth be told, this experience was far improved.  The house was far from crowded.  All the other customers seemed to be families with teenage/early twenties boys who wanted the gorge on wings and watch sports on huge HDTVs.  We fit right in!  \n\nService was better than remembered.  Our guy was over the top solicitous of our satisfaction; so much so that I jokingly asked him to calm down or he wouldn't make it through the night with his hyperactivity.  He was not so far gone as to not appreciate that I noticed he was working hard.  Even a small glitch in the cooking of the Alaskan Cod sandwich was handled with aplomb, with the house manager stopping by to apologize for the delay in bring the fillet to proper temperature.  \n\nDrinks were ample and fairly priced.  Can't object when a 12 oz. cocktail comes in at $6.50.  \n\nThe chickens who sacrificed their flight for us came to us both Blazin and Thai Curry.  They were meaty, deep fried, and bathed in some impressive chili mix.  The former took the enamel off my teeth (much to the merriment of young man), while the latter had great south Asian flavor. Liked them both, but would never be challenged to eat a extra hot one again.  The fish sandwich on brioche roll was surprisingly decent, with the fish large enough to withstand the cooking process and still be crispy and tasty with aioli mayo and melted cheese.  \n\nGlad we decided to return to Buffalo Wild Wings on Rt. 1, Langhorne, Pa.  We enjoyed ourselves, and didn't feel the need to apologize to ourselves for going.  \n\nImprovements noted.",

It is rather staid.  The only Spanish I heard was from the television tuned to a futbol game.  I think I may have heard the friendly people behind the counter also habla algunas palabras. No music.  No Latin American art.  Neutral colors.  A dull environment. \n\nYet, my chicken flautas were pretty good, loaded with chicken and cheese, and deep fried to a dark brown ultra crisp finish, that defied the plastic fork and knife effort to cut through them.  I could crush them, but the utensils were too weak to actually do much work. I ended up using my hands. Burritos does a nice job loading up the top of the dish with guacamole, lettuce, tomato, corn, salsas, and almost anything else they have on the work space in front of them. This in addition to the rice and black beans that tag along as accompaniment.  I found the mango salsa to be quite tasty.  They put a ton of food on the plate, and dare you to finish it all.  I couldn't, but I was so full I did not want to think about taking the rest home.\n\nThe servers are cool, but way different that the crews that serve me in Trenton.  Those folks barely speak any Ingles, and work with primarily Spanish speakers, while here the folks appear bilingual and geared for the Yardley crowd. \n\nCertainly better than Chipotle and Taco Belch, but not the full monty found across the river in the old Chambersburg part of Trenton City or Hamilton.",

There are only about a half dozen basic tables and a high perched centerpiece where the staff oversees operations. \n\nThe menu is fairly standard Middle Eastern/Mediterranean, with beef, lamb and chicken on skewers and vertical grills for shawarmas. House baked pitas are good and distinct from other nationalities, as they are thinner and better at scooping up the excellent hummus, parsley salad, and Moroccan Spicy that accompanies every meal as a forespice. We ordered the lentil soup, chicken shawarma plate, beef shawarma sandwich and okra. A basket of pita came along.  \n\nThe soup was made with pale lentils and reminded of a thin split pea soup. It was very good. The sandwich was made with a long pocket pita stuffed with well herbed small chunks of marinated and grilled beef and topped with a nice vinegary tomato slurry. Very tasty. The only disappointment was the most expensive chicken shawarma.  While the flavoring was strong and savory, it was far too dried out. After a few attempted to chew it, we gave up. It seemed to have been overcooked to a point where is was becoming more like jerky. While I haven't been to Iraq, I have spent time in the Middle East (Egypt, Israel, Greece, Turkey), and never had to deal with that problem. The okra was in a heavy tomato based sauce, and tasted more like mushrooms than the mallow or firm lady finger texture anticipated. \n\nService was friendly and earnest.

    "text": "South Warren Street in Trenton, NJ is one of the bright spots in downtown. It has a nice feel with cobblestone streets, mature street trees and several decent restaurants. Parking requires meter feeding or use of the garage at the corner of Lafayette Street. Rainbowtown Chinese Restaurant may be worth finding parking and going in for a bite.  \n\nThe dining area is deep, with the cashier and buffet tables behind the counter. There is a full menu in addition to the $5.95 buffet. That is what I had when I went in a few minutes before 3:00.  Due to the lateness of the hour, the house owner suggested the buffet was the way to go as she would load up my plate with all I wanted. Plainly, I was a chance to sell the food rather than have to toss it before the dinner rush. Worked for me, as I sampled a half dozen dishes, rather than the regular two.\n\nEverything was actually pretty good. The chicken did not taste of freezer burn, and the sauces were distinct. One of the offerings included sweet potato in the mix, which made for interesting texture and taste.  Even the Bourbon clucker, all dark meat, was okay. Of course, the fried rice was yellow dyed and dry at that time, but I didn't plan on eating much of it due to all the other options piled on my plate. They even had hot tea! \n\nAs far as Chinese American houses go, Rainbowtown was surprisingly ROYGBIV! \n\nI would have no hesitation to return and work from their menu.",

    "text": "This was our first visit to The Irish Rover Station House in Langhorne, Pa, just across the street from the Septa train station (thus, the name). After being snowbound all day, we were looking forward to getting out for some grub, drinks and stimulation. \n\nWe sat at a hightop along the glass wall next to the patio. It was a peaceful scene with the patio covered in untouched snow, and the trains stopping at the little station house. It was a near perfect setting, but for the incredibly loud ambient noise in the dining room. There was a large party having a good time, but that didn't account for the poor acoustics that amplified sound from the bar and the entire space, and made normal conversation nearly impossible. After the big group left it was better, but still louder than comfortable.  \n\nThey have a great beer list, with new specials every week. Impressive. They didn't have one of our first choices, but our server brought us two samples of similar beers he thought would satisfy. He was enterprising in this approach, and right that he had selected one that we liked and ordered. Nice job. In fact, he did a very good job with us all evening and we showed our appreciation. \n\nWe ordered the Emerald Potatoes app to start. Lovely to look at in a huge platter of homemade chips loaded up with cheese and scallion with large dolup of sour cream. This was a cousin to nachos or poutine, and pretty good. A little bacon bits or spicy ground beef in the mix would have made it exemplary. \n\nThe filet sandwich was tender and juicy on an excellent soft roll, sided with chips. Good. My two fish tacos were filled with a small breaded/fried frozen fish and aioli in soft tortillas. A small amount of salsa and shredded iceberg on the edge of the plate, and a small plastic cup of gaucamole. Multi colored tortilla chips filled half the plate. Not so good. For both dishes and the app there was no adjustment for the fact that we already had a large serving of chips in our meals and giving out more potato chips and corn chips was just overkill and boring. They were left behind. \n\nWe brought home two burgers for our teenage sons who could not join us for dinner. They both said they were mediocre. \n\nIrish Rover seems more like a beer and wing sports bar, more than a full meal resto, with way better service than most. Reasonable prices.",

I sat at the small counter next to the hostess/manager as she was being mentored by the owner about ordering from purveyors.  He was calm, articulate, and seemed to appreciate his people.  Impressive.  Of course, the fact that he was dealing with a gorgeous employee may have had something to do with it.  \n\nMy lunch was ordinary.  The Chicken Salad on Rye Toast was just okay.  The toasting seemed to have taken the life out of the bread, as it was overly dry and brittle.  The Chicken Salad was ample, but lacked much flavor.  The cup of Chicken Noodle Soup was a nice touch, but too salty.  \n\nGiven the positive vibe of the place, I would certainly return for breakfast, but lunch, not so much.",

    "text": "The Fresh Works is a small family run chain of sandwich shops in and around Bucks County, specializing in cheesesteaks, wraps, burgers, and traditional deli fare. This shop in the Richboro Shopping Center has some new competition from the Super Wawa that opened up right up the street.  I wish them luck where they go head to head in the sammy department, but they do have the edge in seating, comfort and roots in the community.\n\nThe mini tuna hoagie (5\") I had for lunch yesterday was decent.  Plenty of tuna, lettuce and tomato in a very good house baked torpedo roll.  Actually, the bread was the best part and worth return visits. The sandwich was served open face with tomato slices on top. It was a lot of lunch for $5, with added swiss.  Definitely, value there. \n\nReviews mention the steak sandwiches as being praiseworthy, but as a faithful devotee of Steve's Prince of Steaks, I may not discover what I might be missing. Still, it is good to have a solid choice in Richboro that does not require skipping a local business in favor of a large franchise.",

    "text": "Sycamore Grill is good if you know what you want and don't overstay the best parts of the experience.  \n\nEspecially in nice weather, the Back Deck offers a pleasant outdoor setting in the shade of the historic Sycamore Trees.  If you go for Happy Hour (4:30 - 6:30), and can find a seat on the deck, it is a very nice place to relax with a friendly conversation.  At other times, you have to go Monday thru Wednesday to avoid larger crowds that come on those evenings to listen to live music.  But, if tunes are what you like, you may enjoy that setting. Inside, the atmosphere is dark, cool and well appointed.  The Happy Hour menu is also decent.  \n\nOtherwise, the better time to go is at lunch.  The Burgers, Chicken Salad and Turkey Club Sandwiches are above average, and there are good Soups (Onion, New England Clam) and Salads (Wedge and Caesar) available at prices that while higher than many other places, are much more in line with a lunch budget than the dinners that seem pricey.  I have had the Combination Lunch - Bowl of French Onion and a Salad.  Tasty and filling.  The Burger Tuesday is also a fair deal - Your favorite Burger and Beer for $10. \n\nThe downside is that you have to know when to go.  If you prefer a more laid back moment, then you must be attentive to season, day and time.  If crowd and expense are not issues, than go anytime you wish and have a good time.",

    "text": "Hatboro Dish sits on York Road (Main Street) in Hatboro, PA.  It is a square room with black tables & chairs, but no counter.  It has the feel of a small caf\u00e9, without the emphasis on coffee.  Their breakfast menu is creative and offers a nice variety of morning choices.  I asked my very pleasant server which way to go - french toast or one of their skillets?  She unreservedly recommended the frenchie. Well, alright!\n\nWhile waiting, I looked around the house. About one third full, with mostly locals who knew the staff well enough to have them sit a while to chat.  Nice vibe.  The coffee arrived in a thermos pitcher for unlimited refills, and the milk I requested, in a small stainless vessel.  It was decent java, but without pedigree. Nice to have all I wanted.\n\nThe main course was basically a thick cut cinnamon bread dipped in egg, and heated on the grill.  It was good, but because of its thickness, the egg did not penetrate deeply into the slices.  They were pretty dry, and the extra dose of their syrup (not maple) helped a bit, but, could not compensate for the lack of egg melding with the texture of the bread, which is what french toast is all about. So, it was okay, but not what it could have been given the excellent raw materials. \n\nToo bad, because the Dish could have been a real contender.",

    "text": "Difficult to find office complex cafe in Yardley (actually, Lower Makefield), off Stony Hill Road. It is in the 790 Building which is in the middle of this corporate center. Signage is minimal. The easiest path is to walk around the right end of the building, locate the outdoor patio dining area, and enter through that door. Otherwise, you will be walking down long hallways without assurance you will reach your destination. Obviously, The Weekday Cafe (nice alliteration), is meant primarily for the folk who work in the complex, but if I owned the business, I would want to cast a larger net. \n\nThis is the third food operation at this location in about as many years, so they have their work cut out for them. Getting the word out beyond this small universe is critical. \n\nAnd, while the attractive shop is diminutive, it is worth discovering. They do a decent breakfast with a limited menu and good coffee. Service is friendly and efficient. My \"Early Riser\" sausage, egg and cheese on toasted English muffin was solid and cost only $2.95. The java flowed hot and strong. \n\nThis morning, a few other office workers came in to pick up something to take to their desks, but not enough to make a success. Hopefully, their lunch trade carries them.  They do have two other similar locations in Ewing and Hamilton, NJ, that are larger and also require excellent tracking skills to find, but seem to be doing well. \n\nAs this Weekday Cafe is closest to home, I wish them good luck and smart advertising.",

    "text": "La Casa di Lucia on the farthest end of Bustleton Avenue, in Northeast Philadelphia about a mile before reaching Bucks County, is another decent Italian restaurant slinging traditional dishes to the people of the nearby hoods. There is a big bar in the front of the house, and a small dining room behind it, with a larger banquet room to the side. It is clean and attractive. And, if you enjoy a cabaret feel with sultry smoky chanteuse, this house provides the entertainment several nights a week. \n\nWe were there for a light supper after strong foot massage, and La Casa di Lucia fit the bill. Plenty of choices, solid service and reasonable prices. This is the case in many such restaurants in this neck of the woods. We ordered a Caesar salad and large pizza, half mushrooms, half plain.  Both arrived within ten minutes.  \n\nIt was a large salad with plenty of romaine, and good homemade dressing. We could even taste the anchovy paste. It was a strong accompaniment to the pizza. The pie was good, too, but not as crisp and balanced as I like, and as are available not very far away. Plenty of cheese (perhaps too much compared to the red sauce, garlic and basil elements).  The crust was still too moist making it impossible to pick up and hold its point. Had to fold it immediately to avoid a hot cheese slide onto the plate or lap. Taste was decent, but the texture needed a kick in the crotch to stiffen it up. Took half of it home for later consumption. \n\nI would try La Casa di Lucia again to see what their dinners were about, but would pass on the tomato pie.",

    "text": "Maybe it's the way I was introduced to BBQ that spoiled me for the suburban variant, but unless I can smell the meat in the smoker, and the piquant sauces bubbling in their vats, I feel somewhat deprived of the true experience. \n\nAs a city kid, BBQ was something the family enjoyed as we drove south or west and came across a roadside shack along a two land blacktop with a hand painted wood sign that said, \"BBQ,\" or just had a picture of a pig painted on the corrugated tin roof.  So, going into a modern shopping center and entering a store for this most American meal just does not feel quite right. The space was dressed up to remind of those places, but aside from the flies buzzing my sandwich, it lacked true authenticity.  The lack of proper context detracted from the moment. \n\nStill, my Pulled Pork Sammy was tasty and filling.  The Fries were too salty, but that is a matter of preference.  The meat was fully smoked; soft and pleasantly chewy.  The sauce was sweet and tart as I like it.  There were 3 table rockets with hot, hotter, and vinegar BBQ options.  They all were fine, if not unique. While the abundance of winged creatures at first annoyed as they Kamakazied my lunch, I soon began to find them amusing as the only commonality with my boyhood country experiences. \n\nYes. Most everything was Okay, but not addictive enough to draw me back on their own.",

We stopped in looking for a suit for my stepson, who had secured a promotion at work and wanted to upgrade his wardrobe with new threads. \n\nAlthough the store is fairly large, the actual in store suit selection was meagre. Admittedly, the young man is tall and thin (6'3\", 160 lbs.), but to have only two dark colored suits on the rack was disappointing to say the least. In fact, they had nothing in his size. Our salesperson did her best to make something work, by mixing and matching pants and jacket in one size larger to approximate his actual measurements. Ultimately, we were able to determine the right sizes, which then had to be ordered for shipping to our home. \n\nLuckily, I know a guy good with needle and thread. \n\nThe shop seemed to have plenty of dress shirts and ties, as well as a reasonable supply of casual ware. Yet, they were bereft of more formal work clothes for the professionals in the crowd. Don't know if this is a decision by management based on actual marketing data, or just a supply chain issue, but given that this brand used to advertise to the well dressed male, it is hard to comprehend how far from that image Men's Warehouse has fallen. Perhaps, this is more evidence of new pandemic workplace realities, but some people still have to go to work and dress for success. \n\nIt would appear Men's Warehouse has decided that those people are not enough to carry the business as it once did. It is hard to justify another visit. \n\n2.5 STARS",

    "text": "\"You can take the boy out of the city, but you can't take the city out of the boy \" \n\nVery true. Perhaps this is why I always look forward to exploring Philly neighborhoods for cool places to eat. Today it was The New Olympia House on Castor Avenue that had my time and attention. A corner luncheonette that has been slinging hash for more than half a century, this little piece of Athens is well preserved, with long counter with about 10 spinners, booths behind that, and a large dining room behind the kitchen in this double wide row house neighborhood. The charm and cultural history were all in place, much as it has operated since 1960. I was very happy to have found the joint as I straddled the stool and was approached by the attractive server in black spandex pants.\n\nThe question at hand was - would the kitchen support the excited first impression, or no? \n\nThe answer was discovered soon enough. For this breakfast at least, the rude awakening was in the negative - my anticipation was better than the reality this day. \n\nMy french toast looked golden brown, and the old style syrup dispenser with slip down spring metal opening was way cool. However, the underside chassis had too much char, resulting in a burnt taste that required extra syrup to offset. That taste led me to think that the grill was not cleaned between orders, leaving burnt butter or other lubricant around to stick to the next food sizzling there. It also meant a lack of attention by the short order cook (not chef), and an attempt to hide the dark side from view. The three slices were ample, and had the decision been made to start afresh rather than hope I didn't notice, would have made me a true fan.\n\nFirst impression dashed. \n\nThe Cecilware drip coffee was fine. I love those old contraptions. Yet, despite all the help behind the counter, no one saw that my small cup was bereft of coffee and needed refilling, until I asked. Hard to understand such inattentiveness when I was the only customer sitting there. Chalk it up to my invisibility, sometimes not the best superpower to practice while dining. \n\nStill, I liked New Olympia House enough to regret this happenstance, and wish for a better experience. This could have been one of those true Philadelphia moments that only the city's profound indifference to perfection in the face of amazing potential, created the opportunity to transcend low expectations and truly hit the mark in miraculous laudation. \n\nThat moment must await a more hopeful day.",

It is one of the older sushi/hibachi houses, run by Chinese ownership and because of location and age, one of the less expensive operations. While the quality of the experience is a step down from the more modern Mt. Fuji, Sakura, Oishi, Arirang, etc., joints found throughout lower Bucks County, the difference is not so great as to make it unworthy of your dining out dollar, but is noticeable. \n\nWhat do I mean? A1 is carpeted wall to wall. They doubtlessly hide the remains of years of food tossing by hibachi chefs entertaining customers with food flips aimed for your mouth. They would have to shampoo the floor weekly to keep the place with passing grade. They don't. With each grill housing its own grease trap, it is dubious that it is emptied and cleaned regularly. Yet, the health inspectors allow the business to remain open, so it is up to you to be vigilant.\n\nStill, the food served looks and tastes good. Our salmon fillets (2 each) were fresh and presented well with sides of fried rice, mushroom soup (few in the small bowl) and grilled mixed veggies. Plenty to eat and even take home without ordering anything more. They even comp everyone 3 grilled shrimp. Nice touch. Their bar offers mostly national brand beers (Sam Adams Boston Lager) as well as some of those fancy ass fruity sweet things in hurricane glasses. So, if your policy on cleanliness is, \"Don't ask, Don't Tell,\" you won't have a problem with A1. \n\nOne suggestion, salt free soy sauce for the chefs as they squirt and cook. Standard soy sauce tends to make everything have a similar taste, detracting from the natural flavors that should predominate.",

Happy hours are extensive and often late at night. It is possible to grab a drink and decent snack or dinner without handing over a $20 without change. If your not losing too much, Parx can be a decent date night, with live entertainment and lots of people watching. \n\nBiggest negative - This is a smokers space. Anxiety increases the habit.

    "text": "This is strictly a 2 slices and a drink review. \n\nAmato's on Trenton Road in Fairless Hills, is an attractive space for a neighborhood Italian meal.  On this Monday evening, it was bustling.  I found a deuce in the front window after looking at the pizza-on-display under glass at the front of the kitchen/cashier area.  It all looked good, but I was most attracted to the square cut Brooklyn and Amato Pies, and ordered one of each, \"well done.\"  \n\nThe point about \"well done\" reheated pizza is my attempt to awaken the previously baked pie's essence by making the cheese and sauce bubble again to bring out the original flavors.  There is little worse than a pie that has been sitting around for a while, and is only partially reanimated by inadequate oven exposure the second time around. If the oven master understands me, he knows that I don't mind a scorched undercarriage in my search for more taste.  \n\nA friendly server brought the hot squares to my table on a small aluminum pizza pan.  It looked good as the steam hit my glasses.  I asked for knife and fork because there was little crust to gasp and I didn't want to burn my digits. \n\nFirst bite I realized that the crust had not been reheated sufficiently, while the topside was significantly hotter. The taste was okay, but the platform was soft and far from the more rigid structure I prefer.  The Tomato Sauce was dark thick red, and was nicely spiced.  As I looked around at the tables with fresh baked pies, I saw that those folks were able to lift their triangles without wilting, nor spillage.  They seemed quite happy with their food.\n\nMy wish is that all pizza parlors selling warmed over slices understand that those of us who can't handle a whole pie desire the same sensory experience as everyone else, and take the time to bring the fresh pizza \"zing\" to the rest of us.  I know it's a loss leader for many shops, but regardless of the price, failure to provide full participation only means they have a less than satisfied customer.",

Otherwise, despite the charm of an old fashioned bakery, and the butternut aroma, the products are inconsistent, and pricey. The bread, bagels, rolls are not worth the trip. There are much stronger options for them only minutes away.\nTo be a worthwhile destination everything must be good, available, and reasonably priced compared to the competition.

    "text": "Cha's Seafood sits in on Pennington Avenue, Trenton, NJ, in a small \"L\" shaped shopping plaza where an old factory used to be.  It is very clean inside, with a large selection of breaded fillets and semi prepared shellfish, crabs and king crab legs in various sauces for purchase by the pound or in platters to take out.  The space is large enough for a few tables, but that is not their business model.  \n\nI stopped in for lunch this week around 1:30 pm, and I was just about the only customer there. I ordered a whiting lunch (3 fillets, fries, 2 slices of whole wheat, small cup of macaroni salad and a bottle of water for about $7.50, including tax.  The price was definitely right. \n\nThe fish was sliced thin and breaded in corn meal before bathing in the deep fryer.  I could only eat two of the fillets made into a sandwich, and left most of the fries behind.  They were okay, but far to many to eat in a balanced meal.   \n\nStrangely, they did not offer any mayo, tarter sauce, nor even ketchup with the take away lunch. Any of those would have added to the flavor of the fish and taters, which was sort of  plain as it was.  Next time, I will be sure to ask for those accessories.  \n\nOverall, just a decent, but unexciting monochromatic lunch.  Those pre-seasoned crabs and other shellfish did look pretty good.  \n\nOctavia did a good job taking care of me.  She was friendly and informative.",

    "text": "Pho Washington is the latest restaurant at this shopping center location at 6th and Washington. The menu is fairly limited to traditional street food of Vietnam - pho (noodle soup), com (broken rice dishes) and vermicelli (rice noodles bowls with choice of meat and greens). They also have a long list of beverages on the back page. \n\nWe stopped in before grocery shopping at 1st Asian Supermarket across 6th St. We ordered Pho Tai (beef broth w thin ribeye steak slices) and Vermicelli w Grilled Pork, Spring Roll and Shredded Lettuce (w thin sweet dipping sauce on the side). We started with Summer Rolls with thick ground peanut brown sauce.\n\nEverything was good to very good, without any knockouts. The appetizer rolls were loaded with sliced shrimp and cabbage in a cool, sticky rice wrap. The sauce stuck to what it touched, so it really dominated the taste of the dish. The wrap was quite chewy. It was okay. The small bowl of pho was more than we could finish after adding all the sprouts, Thai basil, jalapeno and squeezed lime juice. The steak was plentiful and cooked well in the beef broth. While the beef stock was good, it needed more simmering with pot spices to attain the right degree of subtle richness. We squirted some sirracha from the table rocket to boost the flavor, which helped alot.\n\n I liked the vermicelli plate the most. The pork was delicious with or without dipping in the accompanying sweet vinegar dip. It was tender and fully exposed with a few chews. The noodles were both warm and cool depending on where it was in the bowl in proximity to hot or cool food. Both temps were fine, and I found that pouring some of the sauce over everything enhanced the flavor of each element, but wasn't essential. I would definitely get that again, but probably go to Pho Ha across the parking lot for quality well cured pho. \n\nService was fine and prices reasonable for the overall experience. \n \nThe bakery next door looked like the right place to hang out over Vietnamese coffee with condensed milk and pastries. Next time for that!",

    "text": "This was my first visit to a Sonic Drive-In.  This one has been around on North Olden Avenue in Ewing for only a few years. The place has two rows of drive-in slots where you can enjoy their rollerskating, eat in the car, gimmick. With an outside temperature over 90 degrees, the better choice was to go inside and enjoy the air conditioning and stop polluting for a while. \n\nThe place was clean and bright with Sonic Radio playing background muzak, and LED HD displays showing their standard menu and specials. There was no one in there but me when I arrived at 1:30.  The young woman at the single cashier post was friendly and seemed to enjoy having a little customer contact rather than talking to people all day long through headphones. \n\nThe Carhop Classic for $3.99 was an irresistible deal.  Single burger loaded with cheese, mayo, mustard, ketchup, lettuce and tomato, it was a nice size. It came with a choice of onion rings, fries or tater tots.  I went with the later. The actual burger experience was pretty much average. Far from the best fast food burger I've ever had, but far from the worst, too.  Not all that much flavor, but the overall bitechew was okay.  At least it did not arrive crushed like at 5 Guys, nor cold as so often happens at the Burger Kings of the world. The price/quality proposition was decent given the special available on this combo. \n\nWould I rush back? No. Would I avoid Sonic all together? No. Aside from the drive in cultural history, it is really no more than middle of the pack. If it was nearby when I was hungry, I would gladly chow down. Inside or out.",

Absent a genuine grill they did a fairly good job on my sausage, egg and cheese sandy.  I do wonder if they clean that press before putting other breaded sandwiches inside.  \n\nWhile the taste and price were decent, I prefer the use of a grill to prepare my eggs and melt the cheese.

    "text": "Tried the Korean BBQ Chicken Sandwich thinking it would have the crunchy skin of those excellent Korean wings in the form of a deep fried breast. Well, it wasn't that as it lacked the texture, but the chicken itself was plump and a big chew. Similarly, the family enjoyed the Chipotle Melt, Nashville Hot and Mike's Hot Honey. All substantial. All entertaining with their various sauces. \n\nBut, it became obvious that despite the overall quality of the sandwiches, they were wildly overpriced at $10 apiece including tax. They were smaller that Popeye's at nearly twice the cost. Given the comparison, Popeye, or even Chick-fil-A, are better. \n\nBeyond the merits, I found myself in a situation with a small sign on the door that said they would be closing at 7 temporarily. That was fine, but their website didn't alert the public to that fact, nor did Yelp nor Google. Besides, it was only 6:40, so why were the grills shut off leaving no burgers, no fries and no salad? In fact, they were out of everything but chicken, so I ordered four different sandwiches hoping my peeps would understand why they weren't getting what they wanted. \n\nI guess if you're plum out of supplies it's time to stop the grill, but it doesn't do much for the disappointment in the belly.",

It's gotta be at least twenty years sitting back in the parking lot along Newtown Creek.  \n\nGo for the incredible beer on tap or bottles, burgers, Caesar salads, quiche and calzone, but most of the rest of the menu is not as good as what they do best. Prices are decent, if a $10. burger does not scandalize you. \n\nThe facility has charm and worn ambiance and the floor plan is comfortable and uncrowded.

The best seat in the house is at or near the bar, and that room gets crowded Friday - Sunday nights. Still, you will find many knowledgeable beer lovers hanging out, so you can have a seminar about hops along with your Belgian or local craft brew. \n\nThe bathrooms are in the basement, down a steep flight of stairs.  They can be a challenge after a few, and I have never been able to escape the sensation of descending into Dante's lair.  \n\nStill, a good local pub with a long beer list and decent bar food. The dinners, not so much.",

    "text": "A Little Dragon sits in the same part of the Makefield Shopping Center as India Garden, but casts a much smaller shadow.  It does a good job with its American Chinese menu, and the price range is competitive with its peers in the area.  The floor plan has about a dozen comfortable booths.  The TV hung high on the back wall was showing CCTV News, the English language station in the PRC, for those of us who wanted to catch up on what was happening there with a pronounced nationalistic accent. \n\nI had a basic lunch deal.  Wonton Soup, General's Chicken, Egg Roll and Fried Rice, which came in at $8.50 with tax.  The soup was based in chicken consume out of a can, and was a bit salty.  The wontons had a thicker skin, but the filling had a better taste and consistency than other places.  The egg roll was 95% cabbage, but there were traces of pork and shrimp.  The General was in full uniform and filled the oval plate completely with the fried rice covering most of it.  The sauce was nicely spiced, rather than the often overly-sweet variant often found in this dish.  The rice was loaded with pork and veggies.  \n\nI was a little surprised that A Little Dragon made the effort to provided above average Americanized Chinois. While it will never be confused with authentic cuisine that can be found in Philly or The City, it at least knows what it is, and does a good job of it without apology.  \n\nBy now, Chinese/American is becoming its own distinct cuisine.  It may never be as purely satisfying as the real deal, but if you have a taste for it, this is a decent place to express it.",

    "text": "Jahan Kabob & Grill takes a bit of getting used to. \n\nAs a first-timer, I approached the shop looking for a door to the restaurant, and realized that it really wasn't a separate dining room, but a part of the larger well endowed beer store.  The kitchen is on one wall, and the tables for eating are along the front sharing floor plan with the beer display aisles.  There is a small opening in the kitchen's partition for placing orders, and then the long wait for preparation and service.  On a post snow winter night it is not the most comfortable place to dine. Live and learn. \n\nThe food, however, has promise.  Based on a Yelp suggestion we had the Spicy Chicken Cheesesteak, along with the Samosa app, the Banjan Eggplant side, and the Garden Salad. The Samosas were flat philo dough filled with very tasty Potato, Pea, Onion, and Pepper stuffing. They were very good.  The Spicy Chicken Cheesesteak came on a quality roll, and had an unusual taste that I thoroughly enjoyed. The spice was one that I did not recognize, and added the proper complement of heat. The accompanying fries were ordinary. If the meal had stopped there we would have been approaching a 5 star culinary experience. But, the Garden Salad was rather limited and bland, and we picked through it.  The Banjan Eggplant was sopping in its cooking oil, and although the taste with the Potato and Pepper was decent, the oiliness was too much and dominated the texture and overall experience. The Naan was cold, likely a misplacement of a heated bread, but tough and almost stale-tasting. \n\nThe reality of having beer buyers roaming the premises in close proximity to our table was not a big deal, but was noticeable and constant.  The slow service was understandable because there were only 2 people working the kitchen, and one was taking orders, packing the take out, and serving our meal. She was very nice and was aware of the problems. A third pair of hands would have been helpful to them, but the beer side of the operation did not seem to have anything to do with the restaurant, and they were not assisting each other.  Management might want to consider hiring someone who can help out on both ends. \n\nJahan is better utilized as a take out joint.  The custom beer operation is very interesting, and next time I would spend the time waiting for the food to go by selecting some exotic brews to bring home to accompany the Afghani victuals.  The Samosas and Cheesesteaks are worth another bite, and the menu may hide a few other worthy offerings. \n\nIt is not the place to bring a date for a romantic evening, unless looking at beer while noshing on comfort food is your thing.",

As this seems to be endemic to many places, it may be my job to ask for a \"well done\" slice so they are left to burn a bit longer.  \n\nOtherwise, Jeppy's is a cool little place.

Yet, the service is prompt and attentive, somewhat anomalous for a Chinese house.  The main courses are well prepared, with some attention to detail, but it takes a few shortcuts that diminish the overall quality of the meal.  The broth for the Wonton Soup is chokingly salty and a brownish tint that suggests use of bouillon with prepackaged salt, dye and possibly MSG to cut costs.  In a similar manner, the Fried Rice arrives artificially colored a dark tawny cast from its mass production earlier in the day. Both soup and rice are vastly inferior to the prime attraction, but as they are served with practically every meal, the overall result is \"mixed.\"  \n\nOn the other hand, the General Tso's Chicken was quite good in the context of a suburban Americanized Chinese shop.  It used chicken that had not been frozen long, if at all, a pleasant coating, and a sauce that used correct spices to attain the right sweet/hot spot that makes for a happy General. It even had whole chili peppers in the dish.  That was a big positive. \n\nWhile I would not rush back to Hong Kong Pearl, it was certainly a decent place for lunch.  If they would eliminate the problems with the soup and rice, and attempt to make them the right way - with a long simmering stock and just in time fried rice, it could be an exceptional experience for this part of the world.",

The front of the space is a little sitting area overlooking State Street through wall to wall, ceiling to floor, windows.  Nice.

Regardless of the sign on the machine and the small picture attached to same designating the flavor that will extrude when the handle is lifted, the actual experience is the same - looks good, feels good, but does not taste so good.  I sampled the Tahitian Vanilla, Very Berry, and Cookies & Cream, and added some Blackberry and Reece Cup toppings.  \n\nThe texture was smooth and creamy and the toppings were rich and full, but the taste of the yogurt was practically non-existent.  I tried to sample them one at a time despite being in one cup.  A weak response to each of them, with the Berry being the strongest.  Just not worth the nearly $8 I paid for it.  Compared to the ice cream available very close by, the yogurt seems an empty vessel.  \n\nFor my decadent sweet tooth, I want to be overwhelmed with pleasure; luxuriate in the smooth creaminess, close my eyes when the aromatic sweetness assaults my tongue and shoots to the brain.

    "text": "While I generally like Red Robin Gourmet Burgers for the consistency of the food in all locations, I find that this particular restaurant being very close to Sesame Place has a noise level just on the other side of comfortable.  Given the choice I prefer the newer facility close by Neshaminy Mall, which although smaller, is more modern and offers a cozier roadhouse feel.  Too, perhaps because of so many kids eating grilled cheese sandwiches, the signature burgers often are not finished to the desired degree, and present in less than tantalizing form.  Last time I was here my server did not ask how I wanted my burger done. I volunteered that I like it medium, but it came out well done anyway.  Maybe that was why I wasn't asked.  I also was not offered the endless fries that are so heavily advertised. \n\nThe burgers are okay in both places and the fries still better than average. The shakes are a bit underwhelming compared to their competition at Cheeburger Cheeburger, Nifty Fifty, and Jakes Wayback. Better to stick with the alternatives like bottomless limeaid or iced tea, where you can hydrate without the sugar rush, and even share the drink if one of you gets water.  \n\nIt is likely better to come to this shop after Sesame Place is closed for the season, and some quality control is reasserted.  This place is a gold mine usually filled to capacity. Sometimes that success goes to the bottom line, but gets lost in the kitchen and on the floor. \n\nSee you in the winter.",

    "text": "\"...Pulled into Plumsteadville, I was feelin' about half passed dead.\nJust need some place where I can lay my head.\nSay, sister, can you tell me where a man might find a bed? \nShe just grinned, shook her head. 'No,' was all she said...\"\n(With apologies to Bob Dylan)\n\nIt may have been the heat of a near-100 degree day, or maybe the high humidity that seemed to choke the breath out of every living being, but here I was in Plumsteadville feeling slightly desert crazed and in need of hydration and restoration.  The Inn materialized in front of me, a shimmering apparition.  Real or not, I was stopping in for a drink and lunch.  \n\nPerhaps, it was my gaunt appearance when I walked into the barroom, but it seemed no one saw me as I sat down on a corner stool.  I allowed the dim coolness to resuscitate me.  Finally, a bartender saw me there and came over to see what, \"...it'll be.\"  \n\n\"Summer Shandy and a Bison Burger, medium, please.\"\n\n\"I didn't see you come in, stranger.  How long you been sittin' there?\" \n\n\"Since breakfast, but I blend in.\"  My wink let her off the hook.  From then on the service was first rate from all the black & white servers, complete with sides of small talk and Potato Salad. \n\nThe Summer Shandy hit my thirsty spot dead center.  It was difficult not to just gulp it down it felt/tasted so good.  That squirt of lemon in the beer was an elixir. \n\nMy Bison Burger Special came out closer to medium rare, but I was pleased with it, as it was full on juicy and a deep rose color.  The pile of Shaved Onion, Cheese, and BBQ Sauce on Brioche Roll made for an excellent sandwich.  Knife and fork was the only way to go, and allowed me to pay attention to every morsel.  It was quite good.  The scoop of Potato Salad was a cool change from fries.  \n\nIf not for the fact that I had a ways to go before the day was over, I might have lingered over a second or third drink, and become friends with the attractive keepers.  I had to face the withering heat regardless of my wish to avoid it.  Luckily, there was an ice cream barn right in the parking lot that was about it receive my dessert business.  More on that in another review.  \n\nThe lunch had an epic feel to it due to the surrounding circumstance, but based on the food alone I feel no urgency to visit again.  It was a solid meal, but it would have attained higher rank if the bar folk had been initially more attentive as they busied themselves with prep work for the evening crowd.  The invisibility may have been part of the existential void I felt coming in, but they played their part in extending that sense longer than necessary.  \n\nStill, a worthy stop on the stagecoach line between Easton and Philadelphia.",

    "text": "Pho 75 on Adams Avenue does only one thing, but it does it very well. Beef Pho in all its variations still makes for a fairly limited menu, but on the other hand makes for easy choices.  Round Eye, Tendon, Tripe, etc., are all there in either a regular or large size.  Their bowls are smaller than in other shops, but still big enough to completely fill your belly with very good beef broth, rice noodles, onion and a load of selected cow parts, to which you can add fresh Thai Basil, Sprouts, Jalapeno slices, and Lemon(not lime) Squeeze.  \n\nIf Beef Pho is your yen, then you will be quite content here, because the steaming bowls flow quickly from the kitchen, and are very tasty and filling.  Just be sure you are not looking for a full course meal, because that won't happen.  No apps. No com (rice). No Binh Mi. No sweets. No Pho Ga.  They do offer coffee and a few other drinks. \n\nSo, what's the problem? The restaurant has little atmosphere; tables and heavy stackable chairs without the semblance of comfort.  The service is efficient with no effort to interact with the customers beyond perfunctory order taking and fast delivery. The place is a bit worn out and could use some TLC.  Most significantly, it is CASH ONLY, with a little ATM sitting near to the cashier.  For a business with five outlets in the region, that is another indication of lack of concern for the patron. Certainly they have the roots in the community and relationships with financial institutions to be able to offer a credit card option.  \n\nBottom Line - While the pho is quite good, if restricted in options, the surrounding elements within make Pho 75 a less than desirable destination for my Vietnamese fix.  There are too many nicer, friendlier, more comforting joints, to make this place \"go to.\"",

    "text": "My first time back here since joining Yelp*.\n\nNew Plum Tree is a Chinese/Thai restaurant in name, but it is fundamentally Chinese American cuisine with a Thai menu thrown in for good measure.  Neither are really outstanding, but both are competently prepared for the local palate.  I tend toward the Thai side of the street and have tried several dishes from noodle (Pad Thai) through Curries (Like the Green Curry dishes better than the Red).  \n\nToday I stopped in just after 12, which is early for me, but I was coming back from Philly, and decided to sit down rather than pick something up to eat at my office.  I had a veggie plate primarily of Eggplant mixed with Green and Red Pepper, Carrots, Peas, and Basil Leaves.  It had a mildly spicy brown sauce that also suggested some Ginger Root in the m\u00e9lange.  It was good, and felt to be a healthier alternative without meat.  \n\nWhat can I say?  It was Okay. I am not rushing back, but neither will I avoid it. \n\nMy fortune: \"If it seems fates are against you today, they probably are.\"  Thanks. I already knew that!\n\nLearn Chinese:\" A moment\" = Yi hui er.  Yes. Time waits for no one. (Especially, bad fortune cookie makers.)",

While primarily a take out joint, there are six tables for sitting in, and for the owner's kids to hang out on during summer vacation. Nice to see the family together. \nMy lunch special was actually better than expected. The egg Foo Young was made with fresh ingredients and the ubiquitous brown sauce lighter and more flavorful than in most chop shops. Even the fried rice, though that prefab yellow cast, was at least tender and full of finely cut veggies. \nPrices were ridiculously low (under $7), and there was a choice of soup, egg roll or bottled drink included. No extra charge for my Snapple. \nWhile the place could be cleaner, and the mess in the hallway leading to the restroom organized and stored out of sight, the food makes it worthy of regular, if infrequent, visits.",

    "text": "Northern Liberties now has a fair share of interesting and comfortable places to eat, drink and hang out over cups of good coffee.  One of the earliest pioneers that continues to pump out java and decent bakery snacks is Higher Grounds on North 3rd Street.  This converted row house draws a local crowd, as well as longstriders from farther south in Center City, and the occasional visitor from farther afield.  It is attractive in a Salvation Army Store furniture kind of way, with a lot of art, crafts, and a vast variety of tchotchkes to catch your attention.  It is cozy and worn, like an old couch or settee should be.  \n\nThe caffeine options are decent, but by comparison to other jumpin' joe joints in the vicinity, not in the vanguard in terms of coffee quality, nor barista excellence. Our sampling of hot chai latte and cappuccino left us feeling like we had tasted better elsewhere recently.  Still, the lemon pound cake was tasty, and the ability to sit back and watch this part of the Universe go by was a pleasant timeout.  Just wish we were holding ceramic rather than paper cups to enhance to quality of the experience. \n\nThere are ever more coffee outlets in the expanding urbansphere, and they all try to outdo each other with service, product, and atmospherics. Higher Grounds has the advantage of being an early provider in this neck of the woods, but also the disadvantage of staking its claim before cafes became more popular and the customers more demanding.  \n\nIf it was open to suggestion, a gentle makeover with heavy cleaning, fresh paint, and a competition to select the best available local roasted coffee, would raise the expectations here to better account for the changing java life in Philadelphia.\n\nThe old furniture is reminiscent of grandma's house, and should stay.",

It is a traditional American pizza parlor with full complement of pies, stromboli, steak sandwiches and standard pasta and chicken dinners. There are a half dozen booths in house, so most of their business is takeout. Service is friendly. \n\nI stopped in to check it out with an early supper. I took a booth toward the back and ordered their Enzo's Eggplant Bonanza sandwich, an amalgam of breaded fried eggplant, sauteed spinach, roasted red peppers, melted sharp provolone and very tasty pesto mayonnaise. \n\nIt arrived on a paper plate is a puddle of oil and thin plastic utensils. Presentation is important, and these guys blew it royally. What would it take to serve a heavy leaky torpedo on something more substantial?

The combination of flavors and textures, and especially the pesto mayonnaise on the crusty loaf and the mix of the eggplant and peppers we're well worth the price of $7.95. \n\nIf they had just thought about a better way of dealing with eat in customers they would have been starred up for creativity in the kitchen. \n\n2.5 Stars",

    "text": "I am a little confused by this new chicken shack on Race Street in Philly Chinatown. \n\nYes. It is cool the way it is an up the stairs second story shop. Its utilitarian set up with basic tables and chairs with little comfort shouts that this is a fast food joint that doesn't invite hanging around, although the wings are prepped as ordered and take 20 minutes to come out of the fryer. I am okay with all that. Yet, although called, \"bbq chicken,\" all lower case, in fact there is no BBQ chicken there. It is all Korean-type double fried chicken wings and cold drinks, bubble teas, smoothies, etc. The wall menu has about 50 drink options, yet just 7 flavor finishes for their wings. Bird choices are wings, boneless wings or chicken sandwich. If I didn't know better, I'd think this was really another over saturated bubble tea house offering wings on the side (By comparison, Vivi around the corner is all about interesting drinks, and offers deep fried wings as a nosh, for a lot less money.).\n\nGo figure.\n\nWhat about the wings? Well, they were crispy enough, and the soy garlic and secret spicy sauces were pretty good. As others have said, the secret in the spicy was that it was more sweet than hot, although there was some warmth behind the sugar. I liked the soy garlic better, but as I slowed down after the initial rush to dive into them, I began to taste the underlying oil they were cooked in. Not so nice. \n\nSoho has nothing to worry about from understated lower case 'bbq chicken'. It needs to decide what it really is and let everyone know.",

    "text": "Charming Garden is a typical Chinese American house that offers both Chinese and Sushi in the middle of a just-off-the-highway shopping plaza in Lower Makefield, Pa.  Calling this location Yardley is a marketing ploy, as it is not that riverside borough, but does have more name pizzazz that its actual address.  \n\nStopped in for lunch after a run to Home Depot last Saturday.  It is a bright, clean room, with efficient service.  The servers keep busy anticipating the needs of customers, while the sushi chef stands and waits for an order. \n\nMy Hot & Sour Soup was good, and seemed freshly made without reliance on MSG.  The Veggie Chow Fun was a nice size plate for lunch.  The assortment of greens was not vast beyond carrots, onion, peas, broccoli and a few baby corns, but the brown sauce covered everything in a decent tasting goo.  The broad noodles held the flavors of everything around them well enough.  My bud asked for extra heat on his dish, but got it bland with a side dish of Szechuan Chili Sauce.  He said it was not as good that way and he preferred when the sauce was cooked with the other ingredients. \n\nNo real reason to return to Charming Garden unless I find myself hungry again when in the vicinity.",

My own decaf latte was a bit harsher than expected and slowly degraded to a bitter aftertaste by the time I reached the office. The chocolate chip cookie I scored for accompaniment was nearly as large as my hand and was nicely crisp.

    "text": "This will be a review in several chapters. \n\nI just started looking for new wheels this weekend.  Three people in my family with new driving permits eager to be part of the great American right of passage. Where is the best place to see all the alternatives and drive a few of them on a private test track?  \n\nReedman Toll Auto World in Langhorne, Pa. \n\nThey have a series of connected showrooms along Rt. 1, with everything from Chevy, Jaguar, and Ram to Subaru and almost everything in between. We were free to meander around without interference; get in and out of any car there, and generally kick the tires as much as we wanted; all without a single salesperson approaching us to push us toward business.  This atmosphere in the comfort of modern display was surprising and refreshing.  We were around so long that I began to think perhaps they accurately read us as people only at the beginning of their shopping adventure.  \n\nWe ended up at the Subaru end of the complex.  We sat for a while in a Outback Limited (very nicely appointed with Walnut inserts in the dash and door), and a Legacy, Sube's \"full size\" sedan (similar, but felt smallish in the cockpit).  Finally, the sales manager walked over with a casual air and inquired about what we were looking for.  They were busy, and promised someone would get to us soon.  \n\nThere was more inventory outside, so we exited and strolled along the two rows of Outbacks of various colors and accessories.  Mostly green and black, some leather/wood; some cloth/metal.  After about ten minutes, a young guy wearing a knit cap and sweatshirt came up to us.  He introduced himself as a \"floater,\" who worked at their Chevy operation and who could sell any car on the lot.  He was relaxed and friendly and offered to get the key needed for a car we liked, so we could test drive it.  That accomplished, he drove us to the back lot where the test track was located.  We circled the quarter mile loop a few times.  Pleasant car to drive. Not exciting, but clearly solid and competent.\n\nTurns out our salesguide was a long term employee of Reedman, but relatively new to sales.  He was a mellow fellow who made our time with him very light and easy.  We got into some more personal talk, and it turned out he was in the middle of a lawsuit, and I was able to answer some questions for him.  By the end of our hour or so together we had developed the beginning of trust in each other. Me, in his basic honesty and willingness to work to find the best deal possible on one or two cars I was interested in; and he, in my willingness to listen to his concerns about litigation anxiety with patience and advice.  \n\nWe will have to wait to find out how this story continues. I intend to buy new wheels by the end of the month, and will give this good man the first chance to close a deal.\n\nDECEMBER 11, 2016 - UPDATE : This story ends quicky. Despite the new connection I imagined with our salesperson, I never heard from him again with the workup he promised. \n\nSo be it. As with fish, there are many more cars around to shop, consider, test drive and purchase. It just won't be at Reedman-Toll. \n\nNo hard feelings.",

Plenty of parking if you want to go inside. \n\nI walked in after lunch to grab an afternoon wakemeup.  The woman behind the counter was friendly and efficient. They had a surprisingly full rack of donut and muffin options for the time of day.  A few customers sat at one of the tables discussing business. Overall, the place was attractive, with everyone doing their job professionally.  \n\nThe coffee was what you expect from this franchise.  Consistent. Strong. Not overly acidic. Not particularly flavorful. Fully capable of keeping me awake for my afternoon surge toward the five o'clock world.  \n\nRight down the middle.",

    "text": "Chinese/American Lunch Special Review - \n\nI didn't expect much reward when I stopped into King China on State Road, Croydon, PA, for lunch after getting new tires for my car a few days ago. Walking in, the shop appeared worn and in need of some TLC. The menu was a trifold handout and photos of their greatest hits high on the wall. I ordered egg foo young, which came with wonton soup and fried rice, for around $7. \n\nSurprisingly, the meal was pretty good (for Americanized Chinois). The chicken stock was not overly salted, nor did it taste past its prime. The wontons were fairly thick skinned, but the filling was decent. The rice was likewise recently made and still granular without being clumpy and with plenty of veggies and bits of pork. Finally, the egg pancakes were light and loaded with bbq pork, sprouts, carrot and peas. The brown sauce was well made and plainly  prepared just for my order. Although the soup was served in a plastic pint container, the solids arrived on a nice heavy gauge plate. It would have been great had they offered wooden disposable chopsticks, rather than flimsy plastic utensils. \n\nI enjoyed the lunch despite its expected shortcomings, but moreso for its small unexpected pleasures.",

    "text": "The first review I wrote for this burgerdom disappeared from Yelp a few years ago for reasons unknown. When I stopped in recently with my son, I realized I hadn't replaced it. Out of sight. Out of mind. \n\nThis is the BK closest to Sesame Place in Middletown, Bucks County, PA. As such it draws heavily from family visits, and has attempted to make this operation a showplace. To a certain degree they have succeeded. There are inside/outside play areas for children, ordering stations that let you avoid human contact if you don't want to deal with high school students working their first jobs, and even partial table service where your tray it brought to you by the staff rather than waiting around in the lobby to be called. There is even a cozy fire pit zone that could be considered romantic by some. Mostly good things (except, my first job was in a burger joint and it was a great training experience, that I wish they continue). Given these amenities, you know that they have some good ideas, and makes you wonder why they don't do these tricks everywhere. \n\nStill, there are some things that don't change. Like the quality of the meal prepared in the kitchen. You still have to deal with thin, too salty burgers, that have little flavor, fries that chill quickly and become dry and lifeless, and sugar loaded drinks that just are not good for you. \n\nBottom line - Comfort is a variable they are willing to enhance to impress the visiting public, but food service remains inferior to most of the new fast casual joints sprouting up across the country, with much better sandwiches and shakes for only a few bucks more. \n\nIn the race for a better burger, BK only seems to be falling further behind.",

In addition to Chinese and Japanese elements, Thai cuisine is given a nod with a few curry and noodle dishes. I was there for lunch, and as everyone working there were speaking Chinese only, I was most interested in that part of the menu. \n\nI asked for their lunch specials General Tso's Chicken, extra heat, which came with a cup of soup (Wonton), small ginger dressed salad, and fried rice. I also had a mug of green tea (an extra charge, although not disclosed until the bill appeared). \n\nEverything was okay, but the only thing that stood out was the quality fried rice. It was freshly made with a higher standard grain, veggies and no dye. The soup was beef consomme with thick skinned wontons and decent filling. The chicken was plentiful and encased in a thickish shell. The sauce was tart as requested, with a few Szechuan red peppers in the mix. Particularly tasty when the rice was tossed in. The salad was from their sushi offerings - a first for me for a Chinese lunch and a nice touch, although I am not a fan of that ubiquitous ginger dressing.\n\nService was fine, and the manager stopped by to check on my satisfaction. The sushi chef stood at his bar in uniform and at the ready. \n\nPeking Tokyo (Bangkok) is a step ahead of its predecessors in variety and quality from this vantage point, and as a new business it is still on its shakedown cruise. Hope it maintains high standards and is successful. Langhorne Borough certainly deserves that.",

When I walked in the other day around 8:45 AM, I was the solitary customer and was told to sit anywhere. I did so at a table close to the front window after picking up their bifold menu at the counter. There was a large board on the back wall listing the smoothie possibilities. Not for nothing, I wondered why there were no fruit, nor blenders in sight. Maybe not the best way to market their signature product. \n\nSo, I slid over to their more traditional breakfast options and Made My Own Sandwich of turkey bacon, cheddar and fried eggs on English muffin with side of home fries included. It arrived open faced about ten minutes later. \n\nIt was okay, but could have been better @ $9. The bacon was thick, but lacked crispness. The eggs were fried to near dryness, where a bit of runny would have better integrated the elements. The potatoes were mealy and lacked the firmness of quality chunky morning spuds. On the other hand, the house coffee was very good. \n\nService was friendly and informative. Access was fine throughout. \n\n2 Street Pike Grill - Attractive with good ideas that fall short in execution. A more deft hand at the hot steel would help.",

Looked great! \n\nI was in the mood to sample the Tomato Pie at Marcello's Restaurant & Tomato Pie, but as it was not offered by the slice, and the small pie was a glaring $16, I decided it would have to wait for another time when the cost was more in line with the occasion. It might be awesome, but it would have to knock my socks off. \n\nSo, I ordered the Eggplant Parm Sandwich with a two buck Side Salad (total cost: $10. plus tip).  It took a while for it to arrive, and I had ample time to look around the barroom where I sat.  Very attractive cross between Colonial and contempo styles.  The room was mostly full with leisurely diners enjoying this mid August afternoon.  The side patio was temporarily closed for construction, but it looked like it would be a nice place for a cooler evening al fresco dinner.  \n\nMaybe next time.  \n\nMy meal arrived.  It looked great on the plate with toasted Italian loaf seared to melt and seal the Mozza and thin sliced Eggplant within.  There was more bread than veggie, and the diameter made it necessary to eat with knife and fork.  The Eggplant was well cooked; pleasantly soft and mixed well with the cheese and Tomato Sauce.  It is a matter of personal preference, but I prefer the double saut\u00e9ed approach to Eggplant and the use of a light coating of spiced bread crumbs to give it more texture and flavor.  This dish was done in a single cooking style, and without the crumbs; thus, somewhat light on taste and interest.  There could have been more sauce as well, perhaps on the side, to provide more oomph. \n\nMarcello's is a nicely appointed house, with attentive staff, and it clearly aspires to be a higher end Casa Italiana. In this it mostly succeeds.  But, I won't know for sure if it is all that until I take my first bite of its tomato pie.",

    "text": "I have never seen a larger breakfast menu than at Cracker Barrel. It is all very traditional and Southern, with huge portions of everything. Prices reasonable, too. Yet, this is not the place to go if you want to avoid temptation to over indulge on very fattening dishes.  Simply unavoidable here.  Even the \"healthy\" oatmeal is loaded with sweet fruity things that sound good for you, but really are not. Too much sugar and processing with everything you eat. \n\nHowever, if you feel like chowing down with country fried steak, biscuits and gravy, fat bacon, sausage ground from various animals, and lots of eggs, there are few places that can fulfill your fantasies like Cracker Barrel.  That, and a cute-to-death country store up front that is Americana gone to seed.  Where to look first?! \n\nI was here for a business breakfast suggested by the other guy.  I was curious, because Cracker Barrel was new to me.  I've seen them around, but always thought it was more a gift shop than a restaurant. I was wrong. It is really both. I tried to order a simple breakfast sandwich on a biscuit, but was advised that was not on the menu because their biscuits were too small. Instead, I could have it on thick sourdough-like white bread, complete with eggs and cheese, but not with the meat on the bread.  It had to be a separate plated side.  Okay. Whatever. Do it your way. Surprise me. \n\nWhat arrived was a large plate with oversized toasted bread, two fried eggs (medium hard), and a large dose of melty yellow Colby.  Two medium sized pork sausage patties were on a separate dish. I had to cut and assemble each forkful bite.  I didn't mind, but it was hard to believe the kitchen could not do this so that the pieces had time to meld together.  It was all decent and tasty.  The homefries mound which they brag about was also okay, but perhaps a bit to mashed and not as chunky as preferred. \n\nThe coffee was average, and flowed freely.  \n\nCan't say that I fell in love with Cracker Barrel, but I understood how that would be possible for people who like big breakfasts loaded with meat, eggs, cheese and/or pancake mix.  For me, it was just overload.",

Apparently, this store only offered complimentary mini-moos for java, but milk was a luxury extra charge item. This surprised and annoyed me, and I wondered whether this dude had it right. Would McDonald's be that dumb as to refuse to open a house bottle of milk for such orders, or was this an untrained part timer gone rogue? My decision; two creamers, please.

    "text": "Kumo Asian Bistro is in reality a Chinese sushi joint in one of the many shopping centers along Bethlehem Pike in North Wales, Pa.  As such, they offer a nice facility with broad menu that is primarily rolls and cold fish, with minimum dishes from China and Thailand. Everything is decent, but nothing stands out as exceptional, requiring return visits, unless you are from the area.  It is very much a variation of the sushi theme, without high artistry. Still, service was fine, and I had no real quarrel with what we ate. \n\nMeeting friends we were able to order extra dishes and sample everything placed before us. We ordered several apps, and two rolls (sorry, didn't catch the names).  We began with their \"Sushi Pizza,\" a good tasting, if poorly named, mix that reminded of its Italian namesake only in its shape.  It was just as much \"taco.\"  Crisp tortilla-like base with a pleasant load topside. Fun and enjoyable.  Their calamari was tempura style, which was not as good as the original in that it lacked good texture, and once cooled, returned to a too-chewy amorphousness.  The beef negiyaki was more interesting as a semi-spicy veggie combo wrapped in beef.  In truth, would not get either of those again. The two rolls ordered by our friends were fine offerings, one topped with eel. \n\nThis experience was more about our conversation than our meal, so the food was comparatively less important than what we were talking about. Still, the room and the platters were a good backdrop for us. We had room, space and time to relax and enjoy the moment. We never felt rushed, and our server engaged with us when appropriate. \n\nPrices were reasonable given everything involved.  There are no doubt better sushi houses around, but this one was right for the occasion.",

    "text": "Two Slices & a Drink Review\n\nThe first thing you notice when approaching Mannino's Pizza is the pollution coming from the tobacco shop next door.  Heavy cigar smoke hangs in the air, making it an unpleasant challenge to go inside.  Public officials should not permit such uses near food establishments as is a negative and so unhealthy. \n\nBut, after getting inside, this Italian house is fairly typical of the genre.  Booths up front. Kitchen counter in the rear.  Dining room to one side.  Clean and pleasant.  I ordered a slice of Tomato Pie and another Regular with a soft drink.  The pizzaman behind the counter was friendly and understood with a nod when I asked for the reheat to be \"well done.\"  \n\nThat is what I received.  The slices were placed on a large plate (so much nicer than using paper), and were steaming nicely as I carried them to my table.  A peak at the undercarriage showed nice scorch marks from the oven, and the aroma of tomato, garlic and basil wafted pleasantly in my face.  The Tomato Pie was very good.  The crust held firm when picked up, and released a loud crunch when bitten.  In addition to the above ingredients, the sauce was mildly sweet, which I prefer.  A nice slice from beginning to end.  The Regular Slice was not quite as athletic.  Its point wilted when lifted from the crusty rim due to an excess of cheese that was too heavy for the underside to endure.  Folding the slice was a help, but it also provided a crease for the extra oil to run off onto the plate.  The sauce was okay, but overwhelmed by the cheese.  I prefer more balance between the two topsides.  \n\nStill, I was satisfied, if not ecstatic with my evening snack.  The place is comfortable and the staff is friendly and capable.  \n\nJust wish the dudes next door had better ventilation that didn't leave a cloud of Perdomo exhaust where non-smokers must inhale.",

The architect and builder did a very good job.  The property is now very attractive. \n\nThe Caf\u00e9 feels both old and new.  Narrow plank wood floor and exposed beam high ceiling provide a light airiness, while the dark tones of the booths offer a sense of colonial times.  I sat at the counter with several other guys and had a nice overview of the operation.  The breakfast menu is two pages with an adequate variety of options and flexibility.  My wait person suggested that the fancy egg dishes were very good, but I opted for a full stack of French Toast and a mug of coffee.  A note said the toast could be made, \"crunchy,\" so I asked about that.  Breading with crushed Captain Krunch. Maybe next time. \n\nMy breakfast arrived a few minutes later on a large oval plate, dusted with powdered sugar, and a small dish of butter on the side.  The syrup was brought up from under the counter, and had a thick pour.  Not maple, but decent.  The menu describes the dish as a \"Texas\" slice of bread.  Not sure as I did not measure it, but perhaps the extra width required more time in the egg bowl to assure full saturation, as the middle was slightly dry.  Not a serious shortcoming and easily corrected. My coffee mug was refilled thrice, and it was a good commercial blend from a Bunn drip. \n\nOne piece of advice I would offer is that the servers smile more.  They are helpful and efficient, but they put off a vibe that they are not comfortable in their jobs.  Perhaps, they are naturally shy young women, but learning to act like a wait person will improve their job approval, and tips. That is something management can talk to them about, and tell them to act more relaxed and try to have some fun while being professional. \n\nPS. A sign at the back door/main entrance would be a big help for newcomers, as it is not obvious where the caf\u00e9 is, nor how to enter from the parking lot.",

    "text": "Not a fan of the Chipotle approach to Mexican food, I was disappointed that the new Mariachi Grill in Campus Town on the edge of The College of New Jersey adopted that process. Their shops on Parkway in Ewing and Quakerbridge in Hamilton are the traditional full kitchen variety, and are pretty good representations of Mexican American cuisine. Although the \"pick your ingredients\" can be considered  the way to customize a taco or burrito, to me it seems more the way to limit the menu to only a few possibilities, while preparation of the elements in advance means you often secure overcooked and dried out parts. A look at all the choices on the steam table behind the counter, offered proof of theory. The steak, chicken and ground beef all seemed desiccated and lacking energy. \n\nThey were out of the al pastor (roast pork & pineapple), and the only remaining juicy-looking choice was the carnitas (BBQ pork). I went with that in their duo taco plate (rice, black beans, lettuce, tomato, lime, radish & pico). The double tortilla soft shell kept its poise throughout the meal, with minimal leakage. They were tasty and well spiced. The rice and beans were forgettable. At just under $9 with drink, the price was fair. I left belly full. \n\nStill, I prefer other Mexican dishes like chili rellenos and flautas, not to mention fresh fish and fruit drinks,  much more than tacos, burritos and quesadillas, which all have the same contents with different packaging. Such variety was not on the menu there, although they are in their other tiendas. \n\nIf all you desire is basic Mexifast food, you can be satisfied at Mariachi. But, Mexican cuisine is far more diverse and delicious than portrayed here, and deserving of exploration and ravishing. There are plenty of those places across Trenton, Hamilton and Hightstown. Once seduced by those amazing spicy senoritas, it is difficult to really enjoy the Chipotle approach to South of the Border cooking.",

    "text": "Pop's Bagels sits in the shadow of Johnny Apple's in Holland, PA. It is a small shop with a few tables, counter and bagel bins along the walls. It is bright white, and on a sunny late September morning the room was very inviting. The folks working there were nearly as bright and cheerful. I ordered my customary onion bagel with butter and swiss, not toasted, and retreated to the side of the room to wait and watch. \n\nFamilies came in for bags of rounders, and a few occupied the tables available. My coffee and bagel were called, and I grabbed and walked out again into the morning light. The parking lot is far larger than the store so there is never a shortage of spaces. \n\nThe bagel was fresh and pliant, with a mix of both savory (onion) and sweet (dough) flavors. The crust lacked any crispness and I couldn't differentiate between the skin and inner texture. Too, the meat of the bagel although light and chewy, lacked the air pockets found in traditional ones. Perhaps, more boiling or lye exposure would create that texture. \n\nMany people prefer this style bagel, but it is not my desired finish.",

I had driven by many times, but never at a moment when I could check it out. \n\nThis is a traditional bakery with wall to wall refrigerated display cases showing rainbows of cakes, donuts, cookies, as well as a coffee service station for those in need of java.  Everything looked great, and the young women working there were friendly and very helpful with making selections.  \n\nI ordered a half doz Glazed and Vanilla Iced Donuts for the office, and one Carrot Cake Cupcake for a home dessert.  None of them were as good as I had expected from just looking at them.  The donuts were a bit past their prime when I picked them up before noon.  Their edges were becoming hard, and the heart of the dough was no longer soft and fresh.  They were still pretty good, just not the stuff of deserving a ringing endorsement.  \n\nThe Carrot Cake Cupcake was packaged well in a well designed plastic container, but I found the ample icing to be tasty, but lighter and less dense than true butter cream or cream cheese.  The actual cake was okay, but not the moist carroty base of a true carrot cake.  Again, it was decent, but far from great. \n\nThe coffee was brewed as I waited, and was fine. \n\nOverall, this place is fun to explore, and perhaps there are other more delicious options within.  Still, I am a donut/cupcake person, and I would not rush back for more of them.",

    "text": "Ritz Diner at the intersection of Roosevelt Blvd and Rhawn, is a fairly typical roadside diner in Northeast Philadelphia. Its menu is likewise standard fare, with a full page of breakfast possibilities on the back. That's what I was there for, and it only took a minute to decide I wanted their Ritz Omelet (onion, green pepper, tomato and hot Italian sausage), with Rye Toast and bottomless mug of Java. \n\nService was very good and it was beautifully presented within minutes of ordering. First observation was that it looked to be a three egger with filling enough for a smaller shell. Its pants were too big for its body, as both ends were a couple inches of egg without anything within. It tasted fine although the heat from the sausage failed to materialize very often. It was still enough for me, especially with the well buttered toast and refills of coffee brought to me by my friendly server. So, I am not complaining, but only making an observation, and suggestion that if I was aware of this imbalance, others would be too, and perhaps adjustments should be made. \n\nDidn't see much in the way of in-house bakery goods, nor a bar, nor even a traditional counter with spinners for the solitary traveler.  \n\nAdequate parking in front.",

    "text": "This is one of the Einstein Brothers Bagel franchises that has not been accurately identified on Yelp*. \nAs with all the other Einsteins I have customered, this one has in-house baked fresh bagels for any meal. The floor plan is large, the tables and high tops are not too close to each other, and in warm weather there is a small outdoor deck with a few tables. \nThere are more varieties of bagels than in most local shops, including those with jalapenos, cinnamon, asiago, pumpernickle, etc., along with the standards found almost everywhere.  The coffee is better than average, and its beans/ground are for sale. The staff is young, well trained and friendly.  This particular location often has seniors meeting at the large tables having a good time.  Perhaps, this is because there are a few assisted living facilities in the area, and this is a nice place to hang out as a mall walking alternative.  There are also doctors, nurses, lab techs stopping in on their way to/from the local hospital. \nThis is not my favorite bagel, as the outside is soft, not firm or almost crunchy, as I prefer them.  It is more like regular bread in a bagel shape.  Still, the freshness and customizing makes it acceptable when in need, or close by.  \nMany people enjoy bagel sandwiches, but I am not one of them.  Still, there are many options on the menu.  Their Bagel Dog (hot dog wrapped in a thin bagel skin) is pretty good.  Their daily soups are okay, and they have soup/sandwich combos at good prices. \nBottom Line - It is an OK place for a quick stop or sitting around for a while, but if a better bagel is what you need, a visit to Bagel Train in Yardley is your next stop.",

But, after that the experience is rather flat.  The side dishes are ordinary (beans, coleslaw, taters, etc.), and the drinks are generic except for the Horacha, which was too sweet and tasted like it was from a mix. \n\nAs fast chicken goes, this is a reasonable alternative to the Colonel or Popeye's, but not as good as a Bojangles or Cluck-U. There are other Guatemalan restaurants in Trenton that make great fried chicken in a much more unique and pleasant atmosphere.

    "text": "I had no idea when I decided to check out Basically Burgers in Doylestown that I would be entering a dilemma that required me to chose between fidelity to Yelp's creed of honest no-holds-barred reviews, and my understanding of the Golden Rule of treating people as I wish them to treat me. \n\nMy morality tale began as a walked the center of Doylestown Borough on an incredibly beautiful early August afternoon. Temperature 78; Carolina Blue sky; galleon clouds sailing their airy seas.  Perfect day. \n\nMy destination was Basically Burgers for a simple late lunch.  Yelp led me there, and I had every intention of ordering their best offering loaded with fried onions, jalapenos, and pickled sweet peppers. No cheese today to keep some semblance of austerity. Arriving, I noted the tables and chairs were bare bone, and a black and white mural on the wall that I took to be Doylestown. I wondered if Crayolas would be available to color between the lines. Given the high level activity on the street, I was a bit surprised that this joint was quiet and three quarters empty.  Hhhmmm....\n\nThe folks in front of me on line were four seniors who could not decide what they wanted. I took the opportunity to study the wall menu and figure out how to put together my slider sandwich.  Too complicated.  When my moment arrived, I was facing a kindly woman who took pity on my apparent ignorance and asked a few simple questions to lead me through the order process. \n\nI sat at a small deuce near the front windows admiring the ant colony that Doylestown had become.  The old folks were double dating, and sat at a quad front and center in the main window, chatting about their Medicare. I felt an involuntary shiver run down my spine at the prospect of sitting there one day. \n\nThe burger arrived, delivered by the husband owner chef.  He slapped me on the shoulder as he walked back to the kitchen, with a, \"..hope it's hot enough for ya;\" referring to the chilis mounded on top of the double disks, and making a bed for them to sit on, as well.  I took a photo to memorialize my favorable first impression. \n\nIt is a shame when great expectations are dashed by poor execution.  This was it.  I asked for a medium burger, but received well done. Little juice left to mix with the pile of fixins, making the first bite experience (FBE) disappointingly dry and with no taste aside from the onion and peppers.  I moaned silently.  I took the ketchup table rocket and shot a long stream of thin red sauce all over the sandwich in an attempt to resuscitate it. Marginally successful, I ate the rest grimly. \n\nThe wife, cashier, waitress came by a few times to ask how I liked my food. She was so innocent and earnest. I smiled weakly. When I finished, I wrote the tip you see elsewhere on the website. \n\nNow comes the dilemma. \n\nOn my way out of the bathroom I walked past the kitchen, where the chef caught my eye and asked again about the heat of the jalapenos.  I had no qualms with the peppers, so I honestly said they were fine, but I have a high tolerance for heat, and could have used more.  He pointed at another burger in front of him in a red plastic basket. \"5 Alarm Burger, if you like 'em to roast your mouth.\" He listed all the hot ingredients and took out a bottle of his secret hot sauce. He would not let me touch it, but his sly smile told me that he was very proud of the nitro inside. I told him I would have to try it next time (Ugh. Conscience pang). \n\nThen, he asked me if I was still hungry?  Well, I wasn't really, but where was he going with this line of questions.  \"Yes. I could eat,\" as any good boy would say to his favorite BBQing uncle.  Next thing - he offered me the 5 Alarmer gratis because it was a misorder.  \n\nI was caught; hook, line and sinker. He was making a generous offer because he enjoyed our exchange.  Of course, I took it with a big smile and sat down to devour another double.  This one was actually pretty good.  Much tastier with all the chili varieties piled on, and the secret sauce torching my tongue. Still, too well done for me, but mine was not to complain in the face of unexpected acts of brotherhood and random kindness. \n\nSo, do I write the review I intended to draft after the first burger, or after the second?  Do I allow this real story to influence what I say about this eating experience?  Or, do I just lay it all out for you, and let you draw your own conclusions, and perhaps use it in your sermon next Sunday?",

Staff is friendly, helpful and efficient. \n\nThe bagels were all decent, but not in the pantheon of great New York style rounders. So, it is somewhat surprising that they use the name of the city that made bagels famous, because they fall far short of that standard. Yet, they are good enough to satisfy my breakfast hunger, even if not epic. \n\nMy onion bagel with veggie cream cheese was tasty and chewy, with a slightly crisp skin. The spread was ample, if not over the top generous. Their coffee was good, with a few alternatives between House Blend, Bold, fruity and decaf. Certainly, caffeinated to wake me up and keep me focused. \n\nThe only real issue worth noting was the inconsistent experience offered by the three shops visited in this area. They looked the same, and the cream cheese was enjoyable across the board, but the freshness and texture alternated between right on target with crisp outer surface and softer texture within; and a chew that suggested the bagel was not as fresh (although purchased and eaten an approximately the same time), and may have been from a batch made earlier in the day. When it comes to out of the oven bagels, even a few hours more exposed to the environment can mean an aging that is noticeable. \n\nSo it was with these samples. Today's was the least fresh, while smeared with the most cream cheese. Perhaps that was not an accident.",

Now that I have used it a half dozen times I have a few comments to offer:\n1. The app is easy to use and attractively presented.\n\n2. If using PayPal or credit card on the app, once you provide the account info, ordering is a breeze, and can be repeated with a few clicks. \n\n3. Both curbside and walk-in pick up are available, but if ordering java, you have to go in and pour it yourself. They do put an empty 12 oz. paper cut and plastic top next to your bagged bagel, so there is a level of convenience if you don't mind walking to the self serve coffee shelf to take care of this. \n\n4. Of course, their bagels haven't changed, so there is no magic in digitalizing the process. Still a soft finish, with a heavy dose of toppings all around. As I prefer a crunchy bite, these rounders will never make my hit parade. Nonetheless, the spreads are decent and the overall gestalt, satisfactory. \n\n5. There are a few shortcomings in the bagel preparation which should be addressed. They don't cut the smeared bagel in half, as I remember they did when eating in. Too, there is no paper wrap around the bagel before placing in those small bagel sized envelopes. Thus, removing the bagel from its sack is a messy proposition. I never fail to get cream cheese on fingers in the process. Picking up and biting into these guys is a similar sticky problem. \n\nSo, while the app improves access to the bagels enough to warrant an additional star, other issues remain that continue to make their bagels problematic. Just don't forget to grab a few napkins before you leave, as the tiny bag is not big enough to slip them cleanly inside.",

But, the actual experience of eating their Baja Chicken Sandwich, and the takeout confusion, not so much. \n\nLovebird just opened earlier this week, and making all the necessary adjustments as Bucks turns Yellow from Red (Covid-19 speaking), earns them some slack from this sensory deprived quarantine, but some things are still hard to ignore. I didn't mind that there was a communications gap between online ordering, paying, and the chaotic scene upon arrival at the small shop for pick-up. It was a bit tense as some customers came in to wait with their shirts pulled over their mouth and nose because they lacked required masks and recommended gloves and the business had none to offer. It was even okay to wait 30 minutes for my order to be ready, and watch a dozen teenagers scrambling to package the orders into brown bags and seem lost about how to construct a strong meal sack that wouldn't descend into a leaky mess at the bottom of the bag by the time it reached its destination.  \n\nThat was annoying as the sandwich containers were removed with oil stains and partially deconstructed ingredients. Worst offender was the brussel sprouts side dish that tasted great in a black roast way, but whose oil cooking medium could not be contained and ran over everything in the bag. A class in solid trigonometry would have helped the unschooled packers. \n\nNot sure what I expected from a $9 chicken sandwich, but I may have believed that it would compare well with the Chick-fil-A, Popeyes, Wendy's of the world which sold for a coupla bucks less. Aside from the warm fuzzies from knowing the chicken's impressive pedigree, the Bite & Chew left alot to be desired. Plump, yes. Crisp, no. Spicy, no. Hang together to the end, sort of. Of the local competition, Lovebird came in last. \n\nJust not worth the high end pretense, especially for what they put you through to reach that conclusion.",

I waited until it changed to English and ordered coffee and a round sweet.  Easy so far.  Of course, when I finally opened up the bag when I was back on the street, I had not been given what I ordered.  \n\nAte it anyway. Not bad.  But, it does prove a point - Sometimes, a drive thru will not do.  There are some things that must be seen before being ordered.  For all I know, they gave me what they thought I wanted.

It is surprising spacious for occupying one half of an old Victorian mansion of Main Street, Yardley.  Looks like there is room for at least 60 people with many deuces around the room, and a few booths.  Brown and beige very pronounced neutral colors. The staff is warm and friendly, and promptly seat you and ask if you want something to drink.  The coffee arrives quickly while the large menu is perused.  \n\nMy breakfast of french toast was good with powdered sugar and cinnamon, but did not seem to be the thick \"Texas\" style promised.  My partner in crime ordered eggs over, hash browns and well done scrapple, and her plate was overflowing.  The java kept coming, as did the smiling oversight of the waitpeople.  The crowd was mostly locals having meet ups with friends and associates.  One woman had a birthday, and the establishment provided a candled cupcake and announced to everyone that we should sing \"Happy Birthday\" to the honored guest.  We all joined in.  That was a first for any breakfast I have had - that kind of thing most often happens at a group lunch or dinner.  Great sense of community spirit.\n\nThe meals were solid and satisfy, if not particularly inspired, nor memorable for the cuisine.  The thing that makes the  experience special\nis the warmth emanating from the staff and customers.  After all, who calls their place a \"Luv-Inn\" in the 21st Century?  \n\n\"...come on people now, get together, smile on your brothers, try to love one another right now!...\"\n(with thanks and memories to Jesse Colin Young)\n\nCome here for the timeless vibe of returning home, if not for the nostalgia of a good mom-cooked meal.\n\nMil-Lee's slogan : \"Food From the Heart\"",

Karma was the choice of our up and coming unofficial social director, Sari (Another great job!). \n\nThe space was a little tight in the back of the house on a long table next to the lunch buffet table and hot plates, but with the glass of wine that came with our $20 three course dinner had us forgetting our surroundings as we caught up with our Yelphriends and new initiates.  True, that the cuisine is somewhat secondary to our passion for each other, but we are \"foodies\" to a greater or lesser degree, and we are aware of what we eat.  \n\nSo, tonight had its good points and some of the other kind as well.  My Veggie Samosa was quite good with good mashed curried potatoes, peas and onion is a lightly fried dough with good tamarind dipping sauce.  One was enough for me.  My Chicken Xacuti had a nice coconut milk based sauce, but with somewhat dry overcooked Chicken.  The Naan/Garlic Naan were very thin, but tasty and capable of holding both the pinched main course and the superior Coconut Curry bath it came in.\n\nThe regrettable shock of the evening was tasting my buddy's Taj Mahal Indian Beer.  It was downright skunky, like it had been left in the heat for far too long and only chilled at the last minute.  Management took it off his check, but the damage to the  taste buds was not as easily mended.  \n\nOverall, a decent meal, but one that was not as good as many nearby Indian houses can provide, although our camaraderie made up for much of its shortcomings.",

By larger, I mean in circumference and in size of the component parts.  Yet, while the fish seemed fresh, they did not offer a pronounced flavor beyond the sauce that was drizzled on top and the Soy/Wasabi/Ginger accompaniments.  \n\nToo, the Wasabi was the mass produced green variety that most offer, and the Ginger was the artificially colored orange, rather than the actual white of natural Ginger.  \n\nIt was adequate and fresh, but certainly far from best of breed that is available only a short distance away.  \n\nThe family is very pleasant, and the hostess friendly and helpful. Her husband does the artistry, while the kids and grandmother sit nearby, making it feel somewhat like I was eating in their dining room.  \n\nNot bad, but not exceptional.

Not having those memories, I am left to evaluate this Street Road stop in the present.  \nBurgers joints are going through a differentiation process.  The McD experience has evolved into a Red Robin/Cheeburger/Hooters high end burger place, and now, a middle rung on the ladder ala Five Guys/Nifty Fifty/Johnie Rockets.  Grease seems to be the special ingredient.  Not that I have anything against grease...it is the \"secret sauce\" of the burger biz.  \nGinos falls into the space between McD and Five Guys.  It allows more self expression in what you want in the bun, and the fries are better than average.  The patty is free form and only 2 oz.  The bun is adequate and hold together better than the white bread variety found in many lesser establishments. \nWhether you like this semi-customized approach comes down to whether you can accept that grease adds flavor and texture to the dining experience. \nI think it does. \nThat, and some friendly service, brings me back for lunch when I am in the area.",

This was my first visit, although she knew her way around from past experience here.  \n\nThe supermarket is showing its age and lack of maintenance.  While large enough to inventory most of everything needed for an Asian home or resto, it has seen better days, and suffers by comparison to its competitors both nearby and in other Asian neighborhoods here and in Jersey or New York.  The fresh produce and frozen food sections are the highlight of the store, complete with those exotics and flavorfuls that are signature to such establishments.  The remainder of the aisles feel dark and dreary, but possess the required products unique to Asian stores.  The fish department in the back is large with plenty of whole fish on ice, and cut ups in refrigeration units. Plenty of staff to select, weigh, cut and package. However, the ice melts onto the floor, making for a slick foothold and slippery walk.  Yes. There is also the appearance of mold on the floor, bins, and walls.  Perhaps, not the safest place to spend time.  \n\nSo, we were able to secure most of what we needed at good prices.  Yet, the check out was slow and bagging disorganized.  Right. Just like the old country. \n\nThere is also an in house restaurant that seemed popular, but we did not check it out, having filled up at Pho 75 less than an hour before.  \n\nThis is not the place to make your primary market unless you don't have access to a better shopping experience.  Still, it has just about everything needed for an Asian kitchen at good prices.  It you don't mind the slovenliness, it is acceptable as the place you go to get the things you need while trying not to notice all the things that are wrong.",

It has been there more than a decade after the owners of the Steaks, Eggs and Things on River Road in Yardley sold it to the folks who created Charcoal, and moved to the present digs in a more downscale part of town.  \n\nThe house was bright with morning sun when I stepped inside for breakfast.  It was clean and homecoming attractive in a 1980's sort of way.  I liked its folksiness. The ladies of the day are still running it as they did the old place, making a space that feels like a cross between your kitchen and a country store.  Everyone knows everyone else, and most of the time I was at the counter the other stools were occupied by management and kitchen people chatting up a storm.  They seem to like each other. \n\nTheir Gemini Coffee Maker brews up good Joe, and the griddle turned out a nice full stack of French Toast for me.  The hot iron cauterized the surface of the egged bread quite well, creating the light crunch I prefer.  Amazing how many places can't get that right.  \n\nA little more attention to detail would garner this Squirrel's Nest another star.  Coming around with the coffee pot more often would be a big help, as would the timely placement of the bill in front of the patron for those who have someplace else to be.  Too, the use of an apostrophe where needed to demonstrate the possessive tense of the rodent so cutely displayed on the menu cover would really sharpen focus here.  \n\nI really liked it despite such nits, and will be back.",

It has always had the big trees and 19th Century architecture, but until the last few years, the storefronts were often empty or lacking in attractiveness.  Things have changed for the better, and it is now possible to walk down Warren and find several nice places to have a meal, drink, or even shop.  \n\nSunrise Luncheonette is one of those urban pioneers.  It is a small shop with 7 or eight stools at the lunch counter, and about the same number of tables.  D\u00e9cor is rather Spartan, but the management makes a real effort to make you feel welcome when walking in for breakfast before 8, while the surrounding state government drivers are yet to open.  I sat at the counter and watched as well known customers chatted with the counterman in friendly tones, swapping stories and jokes.\n\nCoffee was served promptly, and was about average.  My Sausage, Egg and Cheese Sandwich on a Roll was also decent and tasty.  The convenience of location cannot be beat.  I enjoyed being able to park on the street without using a meter until 9 am, having a pleasant breakfast only 5 minutes from court, and getting out for under $6. Trenton is actually showing some gritty charm early in the morning, and I enjoyed being part of the wake up.\n\nSunrise's breakfasts should not be compared to suburban style diners where excess is the name of the game.  No. This is a cityscape locale, where the clientele tells a different story than heard out there.  Life is rougher downtown, and Sunrise Luncheonette reflects that reality.  \n\nIf you get off on the difference, this can be a nice way to start the day.",

    "text": "Gold Fountain II Restaurant sits in the strip with McCaffery's Supermarket in Lower Makefield.  It has a nice facility, with more room than many other Chinese shops.  The tables are spaced far enough apart for some privacy.  The owners are pleasant and helpful.  The menu is the traditional Chinese American fare with little creativity beyond that. Still, if you like this style hybridized cuisine (and many do), this place is as good as the others in the area. For better, you would have to go to a city, or into Jersey to Shanghai Bun or Szechuan House, which are both more authentically Chinese. \n\nWe ordered an app of Fried Pork Dumplings, and they were good.  They may have been deep fried rather than pan fried, and the extra oil was noticeable but did not detract from the overall good taste.  \n\nThe entres were from the Chef's Specials Menu; Sesame Chicken and Orange Beef. Both came with complementary bowls of soup.  The Hot and Sour Soup had too much vinegar for my taste, and was not so good. The Sesame Chicken was plentiful and the thick gooey sauce captured the big pieces of chicken like they were encased in amber.  The taste was what we expected, but some of the chicken seemed dry from overcooking or deep freezing.  The Orange Beef was better, with plenty of thin sliced and coated beef and a thinner sauce that allowed the texture of the beef to dominate. Both of us liked it better than the chicken.  Both presentations were surrounded by Broccoli Spears in the customary way.  So wish someone had a better concept of how to finish off garnishing multiple plates that did not demand broccoli on everything.  How much of that stuff can you eat?  \n\nOverall, Gold Fountain II was a run of the mill Chinois house, with the usual suspects on the menu.  As that is what most people want, there is no disappointment.  The quality is middle of the road; neither better nor worse than the local competition.  \n\nIf I was asked to compare with its nearest competition, A Little Dragon, on the other side of this building, I would say that they are very similar, but based on what I have tried, the edge goes to the Dragon.",

It is in the same complex as Wild Wasabi and Ultimate Pizza, so this is a good place to head for some grub (See subsequent review of Ultimate Pizza, which received 1 star).  \nThe floor plan of the dining area is small, with only 28 seats, plus a few for waiting for takeout.  The space could use a face lift, but it is clean, without feeling overcrowded. \nTheir luncheon menu is what you expect, but while I waited, Lisa, the owner, brought out a few gratis appetizers that were as good as they were unexpected.

Both were reminiscent of samosas.  \nI sampled the General Tso's Chicken, which was large chunks all white meat, lightly coated, then flash fried in a wok, with a tangy thick tart sauce.  Nice effort.  Additionally, the fried rice was plentiful and tasty.  Best was the hot and sour soup, which came out steaming, and full of pork, tofu, mushrooms and way better than average broth.

    "text": "Bread Crumb is a nice old place just outside downtown Doylestown on Easton Road.  It sits in an older strip commercial zone and with lower rent can keep their menu costs down for the fixed income crowd, and those who enjoy a frugal breakfast on occasion. \n\nThe counter has room for about half dozen spinners, and the service from there is friendly and efficient.  The coffee was a good brew, and refills were offered several times as I sat and devoured the French Toast.  The Log Cabin syrup tasted like it might be a refill of an industrial strength brand, but the overall taste of the meal was okay, but not more. \n\nThe French Toast would have been improved with the additional of a little vanilla extract and sugar in the egg mix to bring up the flavor of the finished product and allow for the caramelization of the edges into a crispy bite.  Without them, the taste was a bit \"eggy,\" and flat.  \n\nStill, the place has a certain sunshine charm that makes it a pleasant stop.",

    "text": "If you like street push cart hot dogs that can be found all over New York, you might really enjoy sampling a couple of \"franks\" at Russ Ayers Hot Dog Stand in Rt. 206 in Bordentown, NJ.  \n\nAlthough the push cart is now housed inside a hat box sized structure, they are still boiled in the stainless steel compartments that sit inside the old wooden external walls.  Even the wheels are still attached.  The menu is limited to a half dozen variety of toppings, and they are all slapped into basic white bread buns that can't hold the mustard, onions, relish and other options that the staff loads into them.  \n\nThe environment is the best part of the Russ Ayers experience.  The small hut has about 6 stools at the small counter, but many outside tables for good weather noshing.  The drinks are simple soda fountain options or a few bottles in the standup refrigeration unit.  \n\nAs a rookie, I ordered one of their basic dogs that came with mustard, onions, kraut and relish on top of the Hatfield pork/beef sausage.  The young cook worked very fast to open the top of the boil box, snag a hot dog, drop it into the bun she held in her other hand, and then slather and spread all the accessories is a blur of near-accurate preparation.  My other choice was a bacon and cheese dog (see photos).  \n\nThey were both decent and fun to eat.  In chatting with the workers, I learned that Mr. Ayers was deceased for a couple of decades, but that when he passed, he left the business to his waitress.  She carried on the enterprise with the help of family until the present.  I also learned that they would be installing a milkshake machine soon to add to the festivities.  If done well, that would certainly help.  \n\nI could not help thinking how much more this joint could be with a little more imagination and investment in better provisions.  The Hatfield dogs had a cheap taste.  At $2.25 a dog it was obvious why they didn't have higher quality meat.  Still, I would gladly pay more for a kosher or all beef frankfurter that had better flavor.  Too, improving the buns and condiments would likewise make most people happier with the overall meal.  Finally, unless Mr. Ayers' Last Will & Testament strictly forbid using anything but boiled hot dogs, finding room for a grill as an alternative cooking source would broadly expand the possibilities.  \n\nAs it is, Russ Ayers is fine enough for the uniqueness of the experience, as well as its unusual history.  Generations have stopped in for a few dogs and a coke.  So, it really doesn't need to change if it doesn't want to.  But, as a hot dog lover I would so appreciate having more available from this iconic never-franchised food classic.",

    "text": "\"It was the best of times. It was the worst of times.\"  - Charles Dickens, Tale of Two Cities. \n\nWith apologies to the master, my experience at Empire Szechuan resembles that opening line in the classic novel; in reverse.\n\nWe were just looking for a decent meal after excellent foot massage down Bustleton at Lavender Foot Spa.  I saw the sign and was curious without checking Yelp first.  Spontaneity can lead to wonderful discovery, or just bust your balls.  This was a strange hybrid of both. \n\nWalking in, we quickly realized this was primarily a take out joint.  Two tables out front, with one occupied by the owner's sons playing computer games.  It was also chilly inside with everyone wearing jackets to keep the electric bill down.  I love Szechuanese cuisine and hoped the name on the sign reflected the product in the kitchen, when so many others simply do not.  \n\nWe ordered at the counter. Apple ordering and pay system.  Reading the menu, it was obvious there was precious little Chengdu kitchen here.  Still, we agreed to ride it out and see what happened.  Orange Beef, Eggplant in Garlic Sauce, and Steamed Dumplings, were our desire.  We sat at the sole open table to wait, and hoped for the hot tea to warm us.  \n\nIt arrived in a quart sized plastic soup container, with tea bags inside.  No teapot. No ceramic teacups.  Just styro cups. Free pour by bending the rim into a spout. Really?!  Before we could pour the tea,  our place settings were brought out.  Styro plates and skimpy plastic forks, with those take out packets of duck sauce, soy and mustard thrown on top.  \n\nFeeling so appreciated right there!  \n\nWe poured the cha and waited for the next act to unfold.  This was either going to be a disaster, or outright conflagration, if their slovenliness continued.  We scored a pair of chopsticks, which were much sturdier than the malformed forks.\n\nThen the moon broke through the brooding clouds.  \n\nThe Eggplant dish arrived first.  It was a large amount of the veggie, with other colorful edibles mixed in.  This was way more than could fit in a Chinese take out box, and it glistened from the oily sauce that held it together.  We opened the rice box to shovel some on the plates as our base for eating, and sticked a few pieces of the purple nightshade on top.  We were guarded lest the load prove inedible.  \n\nWe looked at each other in astonishment as the taste registered in our pleasure centered brains.  It was excellent!  Soft eggplant.  Appropriately cooked secondaries. Wonderful garlic sauce that was just prepared for our meal.  Yes. It was rather incongruous after the inauspicious start to the dinner, but one we gladly welcomed.  \n\nThe Orange Beef arrived moments later.  Another huge pile of food, this time, dark brown spicy gloop on top of a motherload of nicely sliced beef, that had been wokked and rolled in a light batter and deep fried before returning to the stove for the final pouring of the Tso-like sauce.  \n\nMunch. Chew. Blooming, mouth expanding flavor of orange and chili, that had my eyes open wide in silent exclamation.  What the hey?!  This was even better than the eggplant.  The meat seemed fresh; not frozen, and again the sauce was prepared just for us.  It tasted as good as almost any orange beef I had ever eaten.  We agreed that we were enjoying an exceptional Chinese American meal, especially given the dive we were in, and the way the story began.\n\nQuite frankly, we were blown away.\n\nMaybe the secret of this place is to overlook the distain of the sons, and the stain of the environment, and just hunker down in the winter heatlessness of the house, knowing something those who only do take out and delivery never discover - that the food at Empire Szechuan is a slam bang winner for those who sit there and wait to eat right out of the wok. By the time it arrives to your home, the magic has disappeared.  Astounding! \n\nWe packed up the leftovers in anticipation of a second round of slammin' Chinois, suspecting it would not be anything like what we had just devoured.  We paid the twenty bucks or so, and walked out into the night slightly inebriated from this rags to riches saga.\n\nPS. The dumplings sucked (not XLB), but we forgave them after this profane/sacred epiphany.",

    "text": "I love the name, \"Wild Ginger.\"  It evokes images of spicy jungles with Jaguar eyes and Elephant tusks lurking in the deep canopy forests of northern Thailand.  \n\nThis version of the two shop restaurant empire is not quite as wild as the name suggests, but does have its positive moments.  The Jamison store has dark red walls with black cut out images of exotic Asian women and the Eiffel Tower.  On a hot day it instantly cools the visitor with its permanent shade.  \n\nThe menu works especially well at lunch, where the offerings on the Thai side are based on the main ingredient you chose - Tofu, Veggies, Chicken, Beef or Shrimp and range from $8 to $9 for the style you select.  I almost ordered the Pad Thai, but allowed myself to listen to my server telling me the Cashew Thai Style was just as good.  She was very pleasant, and she convinced me to try the nut approach.  \n\nFirst came the Tom Yam Soup, which was nicely spiced and steaming.  It was what I expected that soup to be.  Tart and sinus rattling. Nice. The main dish was very attractive with fresh Veggies (Pepper, Onion, Scallion, Carrot, Baby Corn, Cashews), and a light brown glazy sauce that made everything shine.  Looked great.  The taste was were the letdown occurred. While the menu described a mild sweetness, to my buds, there was little if any flavor. Freshness and quantity were not issues, but I truly wanted something bolder in line with my Thai-spectations.  Rather than ask for more sauce or something sweeter to add to the plate, I went the other way and asked for Sesame Oil and Chili Sauce to bring up the flames.  \n\nAfter dumping the small dish of spice and oil into it and mixing thoroughly, the flavor was much improved, and I enjoyed the meal the rest of the way.  It still wasn't authentically Thai, but it was reasonably good. \n\nTurned out that Wild Ginger (II) was a \"fusion\" or hybrid kitchen, owned by someone other than Thais or Japanese.  Such 'con-fusion' houses usually don't work well as the concept doesn't exist in the \"wild\" of southeast Asia, and relies on the theory that no one here will recognize that this concoction approach lacks roots in any indigenous culture.  \n\nWild Ginger gamely tries to offer a valid alternative, and the dishes are okay for what they are.  It's just that they fall short of being fully satisfying because of what they are not.",

    "text": "Stopped in for an early lunch today at Xi'an Sizzling Woks, one of the three XSW sister shops in Philly.  \nThey are known for this Biang Biang noodles and semi-spicy dishes.  Their sauces are excellent for sticking to the mein, and when you get the hand drawn pasta from their kitchen, you are in for a good time. \n\nTwo of us ordered the same thing (unusual for us); the cumin beef with noodles.  This was a single serving in a medium bowl.  It arrived with unseen noodles at the bottom of a pile of small strips of braised beef, green pepper and onion in a cumin based light sauce on top. Gentle mixing was required.  The noodles were not handmade, but a decent store bought variety.  The beef was tender with ample cumin powder and a little crushed cumin flakes, making for good flavor and a filling meal. \n\nThe third dish was a pita soaked lamb noodle soup, which I am told is a extra specialty of Shaanxi Province.  At $16 it should have been, but my spoonful did not impress my palette, despite the dent in the wallet. However, the one who ordered it seemed very pleased, so what do I know?! \n\nService was friendly and water/tea refills prompt.  It always helps to have Mandarin speakers in the party to get a little extra TLC from staff.  I'm not above taking advantage of that benefit.\n\nThis house is much larger than the shop on Race Street, but it also lacks the forced intimacy of sitting at tables placed on top of each other.  To each his own, but I remember Chinatown's version being somewhat better in kitchen quality and cultural (crowded) authenticity.",

    "text": "Yummy Sushi has moved to newer digs just off the College of New Jersey campus, but their food hasn't changed along with it. \n\nIt had been a few years since last visit because I found everything I tried from pho to sushi rolls was average at best. Today I ordered their teriyaki salmon bento box, and must report that nothing has changed. The rolls are still on the thick side with far more rice wrap than contents. Made for an adequate chew, but lacking in much taste beyond the soy/wasabe/ginger additive. It was nice to see they were using white ginger. \n\nIf all the iceberg and cabbage were removed, there really wasn't much to the meal. Two small shumai, 2x4  grilled salmon with decent teriyaki BBQ sauce, and the six roll segments. Not complaining about the $12.95 tag, but a little more real food would have made for a better value. \n\nYummy is still a family place with Granny sitting in the corner and now teenage kids in the opposite corner yakking while serving customers. No problem with service otherwise. \n\nThere are still better choices nearby if higher quality dishes are your priority.",

    "text": "TAKE OUT REVIEW \n\nI was looking forwarded to sampling the kitchen of Saigon Caf\u00e9, especially for a bowl of their bun bo hue and a bahn mi sandwich, but I failed to note that their hours were from 7 am to 6 pm. When I walked in at 6:55 pm, I was advised that the kitchen was closed and the doors would be locked in 5 minutes. My bad. \n\nLuckily, one of the women working the counter took pity on me and offered to make a bahn mi for me to take out, as she had all the ingredients available, and nothing needed to be heated.  I could work with that. I thanked her and ordered a roast pork bahn mi with all the trimmings. I watched as she and a cohort put it together, wrapped it up, bagged it, and handed it over - all for $4. Couldn't beat the price.\n\nI realized as I stood there that Pho 75 was right next door and I could bring my sandwich there and have it with a bowl of their excellent pho. That's exactly what I did. The guys there acted like they had seen this before and were fine with me spreading out my meal with some solids. \n\nThe beef noodle soup was awesome as always, and having the sandwich to eat with it made for a very nice meal. \n\nThe banh mi was very good, with plenty of daikon, carrot, tender pork and leafy cilantro. The only weakness was the roll itself, which lacked the crispness of a French style baguette, but was soft and too pliant. I guess at the end of the day, the bread had been around awhile and lost its crispy edge. \n\nAside from that I was satisfied, and plan to return to Saigon Caf\u00e9 earlier next time so I can enjoy their menu more completely.",

    "text": "Dacey's Pub (aka Dacey's Irish Pub) is a fascinating place.  The location is right out of a Kafka novel.  The railroad tracks across the street are a massive wall of gray trap rock and high fences.  Not a blade of grass grows, nor tree casts a shadow.  Viewing that while walking to the entrance can be oppressive and other worldly.  \n\nYet, once inside I was enveloped in a dark mystique of long bar, high top tables, and rear kitchen window.  The rows of silently glistening bottles offer respite from the harsh glare outside. I slid onto a stool at the bar to await service and allowed the aura of the place to settle on me.  Felt good.  There's something going on at Dacey's, and I would figure it out. \n\nThe bartender came up to take my drink order and hand over a menu.  First timer, I needed a few minutes to reconnoiter the offerings. This was lunch so Redd's would have to do.  The special of the day was Guinness Fish and Chips @ $6.95.  Although I considered a burger, I was intrigued by what was \"Guinness\" about the meal.  Turns out, not much.  The basket was delivered with a nice load of chips (fries) and two frozen to deep fry breaded fish fillets, and a choice of tartar sauce and/or malt vinegar. I took both, as I sort of like my chips with tartar sauce over ketchup.  It did not seem that the fish had been dipped in Guinness before frying, which had been my expectation.  They were okay, but not more.  The chips were actually a bit dry.  So, I would not order that again. \n\nYet, the dudes at the table close by had saddled up to huge burgers and pints of suds, and were elbow deep in their meals and conversation.  That was the way to go, and will certainly be the next approach for me.  I felt like starting over and joining these guys, but thought better of it considering the time.  \n\nWalking back into the sunlight the prison escarpment across the road again stood a menacing presence.  I realized that Dacey's was the sentinel protecting the rest of us from whatever evils lurked behind that barbed wire, and the patrons and staff the soldiers on the wall.",

I realized I was in my first Egyptian pizza shop.  Why not?!\n\nThey certainly have a huge display of pies under glass for people to choose from.  Buffalo Shrimp, BBQ Beef, Cheesesteak, Chicken Parm, in addition to regular and mushroom standard oldies, to name but a few.  Their lunch deal is two slices and a large soft drink for $7.  I've seen that offer around town for less, but when you get the actual slices in front of you, and pick them up, it is obvious that the weight of each piece is equal to two in those other joints', so in fact you are getting half a pie for that price.  For those who value weight and max load for lunch, this is the place for you.  \n\nA traditionalist when it comes to tomato pie, I went for a slice of regular and mushroom.  The crust was thick and supportive of the topside.  With the first bite I knew that I had ordered far too much.  There was a thick layer of cheese atop the substantial base, which was more substance than I enjoy on pizza.  The flavor of the tomato sauce was drowned by the cheese, making for more of an open face grilled cheese experience, rather than a true pizza chew.  Fine if you like cheesy cheese pie, but not exactly what I was hoping for. I prefer a lighter experience where all the elements are apparent, and the topping an accent to the main attraction, as opposed to dominating it.  \n\nI knew I couldn't finish these heavyweights, so by command decision I ate half of each and left the balance behind.  Didn't feel called to take them home.  \n\nIf you enjoy heavy pie, Purple Pizza is calling your name.  They certainly have a large selection of flavors. However, if you are more inclined to a lighter bite, and like a thinner crust and balanced top load, you may have to look elsewhere. \n\nThey also do fried chicken according to the sign out front, but I didn't get to try any on this visit.",

Where most of this main street has come to life in the past decade and now is attractive for strolling, eating and comfortable happy hours, this place is a throwback to when B'town was more or less a dump you wouldn't consider visiting unless you lived nearby.  \n\nMy beginnings were not auspicious, as I parked at the front door, and immediately behind a exterminator's truck.  I asked the driver if he was about the treat the restaurant, or was coming in for lunch.  He appreciated my concern, and replied he was only doing an inspection as part of an ongoing service contract.  Glad they were on top of that. \n\nI came in and sat down at one of 2 booths and 2 tables in the front end.  The space was cluttered and populated by three generations of the family running the operation.  Grandma and grandpa sat at a round table in front of an HDTV watching a Chinese station, while mom and dad worked the kitchen, and granddaughter came in and out doing what 10 year olds do.  \n\nI was sitting in their living room.  Gratitude for the invitation.  \n\nThe menu was state of the art for 1990.  All the usual dishes.  So, I asked for the Sesame Chicken lunch special and a bowl of Wonton Soup for an extra 4 bits.  Let's see what was delivered.\n\nThe Wonton Soup was surprisingly good!  The 3 dumplings had a thin coat, and the ground Pork within was tasty.  The broth was unusual because it had a mild lemony flavor, which at first stopped me mid-chew, but ultimately was interesting and enjoyable.  Cool.  \n\nThe Sesame Chicken was plentiful dark meat chicken that was textured as if it had not been frozen, with a very dark brown sauce that was not as gloopy as expected and nicely piquant.  Again, above average for the standard Sino American plate.  Finally, the Fried Rice while suspiciously uberdark brown, was full of chunkies, and tasted pretty good.  \n\nWhile I wouldn't make the trip to this tail end of Bordentown's main drag again for this, I was pleasantly surprised that the cuisine emanating from the kitchen was far better than the dining room atmospherics suggested.  \n\nGrandma was a gracious hostess and server as her hubby napped peacefully.

    "text": "This was my second visit to a Panda Express, and true to it's corporate nature, it was consistent with my first experience. That is both a good thing and a bad thing.\n\nLet's start with the positives. The facility was clean and bright, and constantly being mopped and wiped while I was there. They keep staff busy in visible ways. The service was friendly and expedient, if formulaic. I was offered a sample of a special chicken dish on a toothpick. Can't remember the taste, nor the name. \n\nI ordered the two mains, one side option for $7.95. Veggie Lo Mein, Gung Pao Chicken, and Beijing Beef we're loaded onto my styro dish, which was place on to a plastic tray before being handed over.  I took a pass on their sweet waters. \n\nAll three were luke warm and past their prime. The taste was good, with strong spiciness on the gung pao, and crispy tangy sweetness on the beef, even though the latter's sauce was overly goopified from hanging around for a while. Really no better or worse than the versions found in traditional Chinese American shops, just not as hot. The noodles we're becoming al dente, but not beyond the pale. \n\nGiven a choice I would normally opt for the local momasan papasan joint over corporate mass produced dishes, but it is safe to say that the Panda is a reasonable alternative, especially if you come when the offerings are right out of the wok.  Even when approaching their sell by date, the taste is okay even if texture and temperature are not quite right.",

Too, the staff in both places I have visited is friendly and courteous to a very noticeable degree.  \n\nThese places remind of modern rest stops found along the highways and byways of America.  Finding them on the streets of our cities is a bit of an amazement. \n\nA very enjoyable one.",

    "text": "My first time to Indian Garden, a destination hidden in the shopping center on Stony Hill Road in Lower Makefield (we all know it is not really Yardley).  It is catercorner from the Giant Supermarket, and next door to Vesuvio Pizza. \nWalking in the first impression is that the space is darkly lit, and in combination with the aroma of curry, cardamon, and other spices, feels a little like entering a bazaar on the subcontinent.  As the eyes adjust, white table clothes appear on small square and large round tables reflecting the dim recessed lighting and the illumination over the buffet tables. They are a little close together, requiring a bob and weave to access the back tables. Still, very engaging way to start the experience.  The staff in black and white with ties is super efficient and helpful. \nI went with the buffet to be able to sample more than would be possible ordering off the menu, although another reviewer warned off doing this.  I tried : Vegetable Pakora (not hot enough, and thus a little oily), Chicken Tikka Masala (very good), Chicken Kadai (good and smokey flavored), Chicken Makhani (nice creamy tomato/ginger sauce), Vegetable Korma (was that frozen veggies in a good Korma?), Chana Saag (very enjoyable), Aloo Bhartha (love eggplant in all incarnations), Paneer Makhani (the cheese reminds of tofu, but decent), Naan (quite good, but wanted garlic), Mango Lassi (excellent), and mango pudding (really?). Ok. I won't have dinner tonight. \nTotal Cost: $12.50\nGiven the almost total absence of Indian food in the immediate area, Indian Garden is very good, and worth another trip.  Next time, I will order off the menu and see what shakes out.  Upgrades are definitely possible once the larger menu is penetrated and surrenders its secrets.\n\n9.28.13 - Returned for another lunch buffet today with a few campaign people. The floor was not crowded when we arrived, but slowly filled after 1:00.  I think I was placed at the same table as my first visit. I love when that happens. Kismet. The food was as good as last time, and the Naan changed from Regular to Onion while we were there, and added to the sop up enjoyment of all the rich sauces mixing on the plate.  I was a bit distracted with conversation so did not commit to memory what I ate, but I thoroughly enjoyed the mix of flavors, textures, and basics. \n3 Stars with a Bullet.  This place is going to move up soon.\n\n11.11.16 UPDATE - Sometimes the best intentions to return to a restaurant soon to followup on good early impressions are swallowed by life taking you elsewhere. So it was with Indian Garden. Job changes, new food outlets, or just plain forgetfulness, play a hand. Still, I finally came back here last Friday night with family when we decided we hungered for local spice. \n\nWe were seated promptly without reservations at 6 by the smiling hostess. The large dining room was half empty on arrival, but filled quickly with some recognizable faces. Just beat the rush. \n\nThe three of us ordered Veggie Samosa and Chili Pakora apps. Both good, but the Pakora had a too thick fried coating over the pepper and filling. Reminded of a Relleno, but not as smoothly integrated. The Chicken Curry was fresh with a nice red mild heat. Our Lamb Korma had grilled baa-baa pieces in a smooth and almond sweet beige sauce, that was the star of the show. The third dish was a potato and eggplant combo with chunkiness and light spice finish without a pond around it. Their Basket of Naan completed our table. \n\nEverything was solid, if not exceptional, with a tendency to underspice all their dishes, perhaps in tune with the palates of their clientele. Not a criticism, but an adjustment to reality. Yet, if a stronger  South Asian taste is what you seek, just ask for max heat, or try the local alternatives (Guru, Dream Spicy), where there is less accommodation to neighborhood preference for dilution. \n\nStill, the quality of the meal was undeniable. A little fine tuning will achieve the heat quotient desired. Indian Garden is fan worthy.",

    "text": "Yummy Sushi sits in an unconventional food court - a mid-sized strip center surrounded by Chinese, Pizzeria, Bagel joint, Hungarian, Italian and Sports Bar restaurants.  You can walk to all of them in under five minutes.  Very convenient if you have a diverse group that can't decide what to eat.  \n\nAlthough Yummy is ostensibly a raw fish house, I came strictly for the Pho, the Vietnamese Noodle Soup that is known as a wonderful comfort food.  And, it was so here.  The broth was rich and complex with the right spices and time spent simmering to unleash the subtle undertones.  The nest of rice noodles at the bottom of the large bowl was difficult to corral as they were very long and did not drop easily into the flat bottomed spoon.  \n\nThey offer only one form of Pho here - Flank Steak and Meatballs. The Steak arrived medium/rare and continued to reach medium from the heat of the soup.  The Meatballs were sliced, but very dense, reminding me that \"meatball\" doesn't always mean Italian. The bowl already contained Sprouts and Basil Leaves when it landed on my table.  Only the Lime and Jalapeno slices were on the side.  Hoisin Sauce and Sriracha were delivered, but there was no dish to squirt them into.  I used the one the lime and jalapeno came in, and dipped the meat into both before eating.  \n\nI did also try the Fried Wontons (described as Pork Dumplings in the menu).  They were not very good, as they were over deep fried and had a burnt taste. The Duck Sauce that came with them was watery and lacking in flavor.  \n\nThe Mama-san was very cordial to all the customers, although she spent a lot of time with those she knew best.  Her children were present, but did not disturb anyone.",

    "text": "What the heck is a Chalupa? \nIn Mexico it is a small boat or a food creation in Oaxaca and Puebla that molds masa dough (base ingredient of a tortilla) into the shape of a concave container, filled with pork, chicken, beef, peppers, onion and salsa, before deep frying. It looks like a cup or skiff, rather than a enlarged taco. \nWhat I ordered at this Taco Bell arrived at my table looking much more like the big soft taco, than the smaller corn cup described on Wikipedia. So, the name is assumed via poetic license, and not the actual dish it is South of the Border. \nDespite this misappropriated name, this version of a Chapula was still tasty and filling. I had the chicken filling, and found the package enjoyable to eat, if not the most authentic tasting Mexican food in the world. Really lacked serious spice quotient. The lunch special offered two of these babies, plus a soft ground beef taco thrown in for good measure. It was all far too much to eat in one sitting, unless gaining weight was a priority. I left half the second Chalupa and three quarters of the taco on the tray when I departed. \n\nWith all the excellent real Central American houses around these days, it is difficult to be excited by Taco Bell, which is a mere shadow of  good Mexican or Salvadoran food. Prices are low, but so is the dining experience. \n \nOkay if hungry in the desert, but not close to what you can get if you really want the real deal.",

    "text": "A Happy Family is both the name of this Chinese/American shop and a description of the people who own and operate it. \n\nI met both spouses during my lunch there yesterday.  The mister took my order and chatted with me, and the misses served my plate of egg foo young, egg roll and fried rice, with a smile and gratitude.  They have been in this location just off Brunswick Circle in Trenton, NJ for a few years, and seem to be making of go of it.  \n\nThe store is long and narrow, with a small dining room in front, two middle rooms that appear to be used by the family, and a rear kitchen.  There is some distance between front and back, and they installed a bell for customers to use to catch their attention.  I used it to get them to come out and accept my payment.  \n\nThe lunch was about par for the course in the metro area.  All the owners must have gone to the same restaurant school, because most of the wonton houses have identical menus, and tastes.  A Happy Family is no different, except that they deserve credit for making their fried rice without soup bouillon with dye to color the rice.  This pile of grain looked natural, and was nicely chunky.  The pancakes were full of veggies, wok fried, with a plastic cup of brown sauce on the side.  It was decent.  The egg roll was mostly cabbage with a few slivers of pork, but I didn't expect anything more.  \n\nThey have a confusing menu because of the similarity of the lunch specials, and combo offerings.  Not clear what the differences are, except one costs less than $6, while the other comes in at $7.50.  Not a big deal either way, but I like to know what I am looking at when ordering. \n\nA Happy Family is worth a visit if Chinois Americain is something you like. Your visit will do a lot to keep these folks pleased.",

    "text": "Home Place Restaurant sits in a rather forlorn older strip center on Bristol Road in Bensalem, PA.  This is the latest in a line of restaurants that have made a run at a successful kitchen at this location. It shares the strip with a Wawa, which offers indirect competition for coffee and breakfast sandwiches with its neighbor. \n\nThe house is pretty large with several dozen tables, a high display with desserts, and two HDTVs on the wall.  The furnishings are new utilitarian, but there is a dark carpet on the floor which is never a sanitary solution compared to a hard surface that can be swept, mopped and vacuumed clean. Service was friendly and attentive.  My small coffee mug was refilled twice without need to ask. Breakfast menu is larger than many restaurants, and although Home Place is not a traditional diner, and lacks a counter service, it did have a broad breakfast list with morning specials at very low prices. \n\nI opted for their Greek omelet with special request to put the home fries inside, rather than on the plate.  That always adds substance to the eggs and allows the potatoes to integrate with the rest of the ingredients. Tastes better to me. The plate arrived ten minutes later looking quite good. The three eggs had been mixed with the feta cheese, onion, pepper and spuds, rather than left as a shell.  I prefer this approach, although it was no longer a true omelet. It was pretty good, but needed more than a shake of black pepper and salt to bring up the flavor. The feta, while salty, was not in sufficient abundance to offset the need for sodium chloride. The rye toast was lightly buttered and a good complement to the eggs. The coffee was strong and hot.\n\nNo serious complaints about Home Place. It was pretty much a decent breakfast, but lacking any WOW factor. The location and clientele do not permit prices necessary to do things to make the space and offerings more attractive and intriguing, yet does provide a substantial meal which should not be disregarded.",

The Burger was right on Medium, but crumbled when cut due to freezing.  It wasn't bad, but they would have done better hiring a crew from Five Guys to handle this chore. The Onion Ring on top was over-fried, as was everything on the Appetizer Mix Platter. The Wings were not good, the Chicken Fingers were dry and tasted of yesterday's oil.

It has a small private parking lot behind the structure, with much more space available in the Mealey Furniture lot next door. There is a dining room as well as a large counter for folks like me who are eating alone and enjoy watching their employees as they work. \n\nThe staff is friendly and efficient. I had menu in hand and a mugga joe before me within a minute of sitting down. Traditional diner fare, with a few things for which they are noted - chicken croquettes and Jewish apple cake - among them. It even had a moment of fame when it was the subject of Guy Fieri's Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives show on the Food Channel. Of course, Guy is all about spiked hair showmanship and excessive exuberance, and not necessarily honest assessment of the food he is mugging for. Here, his enjoyment was legitimately entertained by the urban nature of this part of town having its own stainless palace, but also likely uninformed by the other Philly Special joints in the same neighborhood that far outshine The Dining Car (The Clown House, for example). \n\nI was there for a French Toast breakfast, although I was tempted to see what the fuss was all about with the apple cake. Doubt it was better than grandma's. \n\nStill, I enjoyed my morning repast, even if not outstanding. Two slices of decent white loaf seemed a bit light if it wasn't a short stack. Although advertised with \"maple syrup,\" I'm fairly certain that the sticky sweet colloidal liquid pouring out of the container on the counter was not from a maple tree. Tasted a lot more like a generic Mrs. Buttersworth. Still sweet. Still a decent companion to the fry bread. Just not Grade B Dark.

Very easy to ignore the vehicles coming from the left, or walkers in front of you while stowing a bag of nosh.  Service is fine at the counter. \n\nThere is no doubt that Wendy is attempting to up its game in order to compete with the fast casual burger crowd.  Most ingredients are fresh, and the new basic roll is an order of magnitude better than the old one.  It holds together throughout eating, and has a pleasant flavor.  The only remaining issue is the quality of the beef patty.  Its taste and texture appear the same as the old version, which is to say that it is somewhat mealy (frozen), and lacking any real verve in taste, and juiciness.  It still seems flat and uninspired.  \n\nSo, the key to enjoyment is keeping the package together while consuming, with the fresh onion, lettuce and cheese can dominate the experience.  As a whole, the burger is just okay, although an improvement over its predecessor, it has a long road to travel until it can stand next to its cousins at Red Robin, Cheeburger, or even your local corner tavern.",

My approach to new places like this is to start with their basics and if satisfied, return for the high end expensive meals.  \n\nSo, we ordered a chicken broccoli rabe panini, and a chicken, spinach sandwich on a 7\" hoagie roll.  The place wasn't busy, so they allowed us to sit in the big boy room. Service was slow as a rainy Sunday afternoon in April, but we weren't in a rush.  They provided a basket of bread and an olive oil herbal mix for dipping. Enjoyed that. \n\nOur lunches arrived looking quite nice on white ceramic plates. The panini was nicely grilled and came with a load of crisp fries. The smaller sandwich was less impressive, with a minimum of grilled chicken, saut\u00e9ed spinach and two square slices of mozzarella melted over the top.  Son enjoyed half the panini and could not finish the second. We brought it home.  The chicken 'wich was just okay, with no effort to make it appealing or tasty. I guess we shouldn't expect much for the low price, but it was disappointing nonetheless. \n\nWe also ordered a small standard pizza with sausage to take home.  When we opened the box, it looked fine with plenty of chunky meat and red sauce.  We reheated it in the oven a few hours later, and found it to be a decent pie.  The sauce was a bit salty, but overall we liked it. Can't be too fussy about a reheat job. They are never as good as piping hot from the oven. \n\nIt was hard for us to get overly excited by Salvadore's.  It is certainly a place where you can stuff yourself at a good price, but the offerings we had were not the stuff of return visits. Yet, the large menu did have some tempting items in the pasta, marsala and francaise department. On another rainy day, we could find ourselves there again to check them out. Our server certainly encouraged us to come back and give them a try.",

    "text": "Tre Fratelli was the first meal I had when moving to Bucks County many years ago.  It was decent then, and remains decent now.  The pizza, cheesesteaks, sandwiches and pasta are the way to go here.  The dinners are a step down from memorable, and not able to generate a strong desire to return for more.  \n\nTwo of us had the Chicken Parm dinner, and our third, the Marsala.  The Parm's chicken breasts were large and cooked to the right point of nicely retained juiciness, but the Red Sauce was heavy and covered the entire bird so not even a pan fried edge could be seen for visual cuing. The Mozza melt was similarly overdone; making the plate about its toppings rather than complimenting the chicken.  The Marsala was overcooked and left less than tender medallions adrift in a dense brown wine redux that should have been lighter and more subtle.  Both dishes were edible, but less that we hoped.  \n\nThe surprising upside were the sides that came with the meal.  Each of the three we ordered; the French Fries, Penne Oglio Olio, and Veggies arrived in large, family dinner sizes, and were totally enjoyable.  The taters were hot and crunchy, the veggies bright and lightly tossed with Olive Oil and Garlic, and the pasta, loaded with razor-thin Garlic Slices browned to gold like copper leaves in a mound of snow.  Al Dente and more fun to eat than the mains.  \n\nIt happens that way sometimes.  Stick with the basics.",

    "text": "Sitting back off Bethlehem Pike a block from the top of Chestnut Hill @ Germantown Avenue, Thai Kuu is a small attractive Asian dining room. Buddhas and elephants adorn the walls and menus giving a serene atmosphere that augurs well for the meal to come. This establishment offers weekend lunch at a reasonable price, and I was there to check it out. Many similar houses eliminate the midday meal discount on weekends, and I appreciated that this one kept it in play. \n\nI saw what I wanted and ordered Tom Ka Soup and Spicy Pad Kee Mao (aka Drunken Noodles). Service was provided by a gentleman I took to be an owner/manager. While efficient and cool, he also had an officiousness that was subtly off-putting. Maybe he objected to my black hoodie or my dining solo, but I wasn't going to allow his silent judgment interfere with my enjoyment. The food, on the other hand, could impact my take on the experience. At the end of my meal, that opinion was less than my first impressions. \n\nThe Tom Ka was pretty good with strong coconut flavor, a hint of lemongrass and fair amount of string bean, carrot, mushroom and broccoli. I lifted the square bowl to my lips to suck it all in. I anticipated the Pad Kee Mao would be hot and spicy from a chili pepper base sauce, and from the word \"spicy\" in the name on the menu. Not the case. \n\nInstead, the word was used to label the sweetness of the middle width noodles and brown sauce, not its heat. An exceedingly small portion, its lack of traditional burn was disappointing; pointing to the conclusion that Thai Kuu was far more an Asian fusion kitchen than anything close to vibrant Siam fire. \n\nIt was all okay, but could have been so much more had they the courage of their culinary convictions.",

At $36 per person, it was an expensive thrill, and if I had to cost it out, it came to about $10 a scare. Not really all that spooked out, but they are dealing with a mixed audience and what frightens me might cause coronaries in others. Yet, the monster in the Trump mask was so realistic I almost thought he was moonlighting. \n\nThe flatbed wagon held about a dozen people and the course went on for 20 minutes. There were plenty of ghouls and demons along the route and they never came out of character. The haunted house was very dark and foreboding, and the choreography was, again, well done. Plenty of screams. \n\nThere is a small snack area, but don't come to eat to avoid leaving it on the field. \n\nThe guys had a lot of fun and the two hours there went quickly. I probably won't do this again as the world is frightening enough without finding more ways to be scared s**tless!",

In fact, I was the only customer in the house. I had the warehouse to myself. \n\nI ordered their tacos carnitas with pinto beans and brown rice. I watched as the friendly preparer put my snack together, asking me to choose from each of the ingredient options as she moved down the steam table. She ended with the type of finishing sauce I wanted squirted on top. I went with the most spicy chipotle/chili pepper. \n\nThe tacos were good, if a bit drippy. The pork was tender and moist, and the overall big bite was tasty and filling. The rice and beans may have been on the steam table all day, so were past their prime - a bit dried out. Still, I was dining alone and had time to look around and appreciate the historic structure surrounding me. More on that in another review.",

I did like the somewhat thicker crust and pasty thick tomato sauce, but not more than the quality \"Jersey\" style pizza from joints like DeLorenzo's in Lower Makefield, or the Burg in Falls, to name a few others. \n\nI guess being suckled on Brooklyn and Trenton slices spoiled me for other conceptions. I just like the thinner crusted, basil flavored, chunky tomato sauced, creations, with the secrets of the dough mixed with softer water that flavors the crust with subtle cracker-like tones and texture. \n\nTo my buds, the Trenton Pie is perfection, far superior to the upside down variation Philly is famous for. It's not that I don't enjoy this style once in a while, but given the choice, the ones from Trenton win every time.",

The roll was better than average with a fresh firm crust and flakey innards. It was a good sammy with oozing American cheese and fried egg.  I would certainly have it again if nearby in the morning. The coffee was hot and middle of the road in strength. \n\nPrice was under $6 for food and beverage; a very attractive price.  \n\nIf Deli-Licious Caf\u00e9 had a bit more character and comfort, it could easily garner the fourth star.",

When I need to pick up a load of dress shirts and private garments they have always been a source for heavily discounted, recognizable brands that were perfect for the daily grind of my law career. With 30 suits in the wardrobe in heavy rotation, I needed that many shirts and twice as many ties to keep myself looking the part of a successful abogado. Why pay department store prices when the same garments were available at 80% off? On the other hand, so much rack space is full of junk and poor quality merchandise, that I hate walking in for anything beyond those few things I find useful. \n\nCovid has changed all that with Zoom conferences and hearings where no one sees the suit beyond the headshot on the screen. Judges are no longer sanctioning lawyers for improper dress, as they leave their robes on the clothing tree in the corner of their chambers (if working from court at all). Professional life has become more casual, although I'd return to the old ways in a second if we could eliminate this virus and be fully safe in public again. \n\nThis visit I wasn't there for myself, but for my stepson who had received a promotion and had to upgrade his work garb to suit his position in management. We had purchased suits elsewhere, and now needed to supplement the basics with shirts and ties to complement them. While he was willing to buy everything in one place, I was compelled to teach him where to save money without sacrificing quality. When you can pick up seven name brand dress shirts for under $200 (list price more than twice as much), even he recognized what he could do with the money saved over a lifetime. \n\nSo, now he will be the best dressed manager on the casino floor. At 6' 4\", he will stand out like a beacon of sartorial splendor. No one will ever know his new found secret to success. \n\nAnd, I will have passed on a family value, and done my step parenting very well.",

If you love Elvis and think he and Marilyn are the apex of American culture, this is your place. \n\nThe world may have changed, but the Anthony's pizza remains the same.

    "text": "REHEATED SLICE COVID TAKEOUT REVIEW:\n\nThe constant problem with ordering pizza by the slice is that they require sufficient reheating in the oven to resuscitate it into edible condition. If not requested to be \"well done,\" they are only partially revived, while the rest tastes dead or just lacking in energy. \n\nThe same is true here. Without knowing how long it had been sitting on the cooling rack, nor the heat of the oven, the time spent could have been enough to scorch the undercarriage and bubble up the cheese, but it didn't quite make it all the way back to life. As a result it was a mediocre slice. Decent crust, almost right sauce needing more basil, and thick cheese deposit in the center that wasn't quite the volcanic lava desired. \n\nNot bad for noshing in the car on the way back to Bucks, but not the Jersey Strong hoped for. \n\nOh, and the shop really needs a deep cleaning.

Once there I saw a counter with kitchen equipment behind it, and a couple dudes aproned up for food service. My personal sized pizza and cheese steak hoagie were already boxed and ready to head out the door. \n\nMaybe using this Slice app would be acceptable. At least the food was ready as advertised. \n\nUpon opening at the kitchen table, I beheld a 12\" pie with heavy cheese, and lighter puddles of red sauce, mozza droppings and a scattering of green basil leaf. Looked sort of like a child's drawing of a clown face. The cheese steak hoagie was more handsome, with goodly amount of thin grilled beef mixed with cheese (provolone?), topped with lettuce, tomato and red onion. Liked it.\n\nTaste was uneven. The pizza had too much cheese and not enough of anything else. Even still warm it was out of balance, with the crust its strongest attribute. The sandwich was good and hung together well in the torpedo. \n\nWon't be rushing back for takeout, but the broader menu for in house dining might be worth a try aside from the tomato pie.",

The java was industrial strength, as desired. The three egger was okay with an overload of green pepper along with onion and diced potatoes. The hash browns were a bit of overkill given their cousins in the eggs, and would have tasted better if they replaced the spuds inside the shell, as they had far more flavor and texture than those puny chunks used as filler. Overall, the opus was a tad dry, detracting from what might have been a contender had it been moister and had better balanced ingredients. \n\nLiked the rye toast. \n\nService was fine.

I was the sole customer when I walked in last weekend on a Saturday afternoon. I was mildly surprised by the lack of activity, but the staff was friendly, and answered by rookie questions with a smile. \n\nI opted for the Chop House Burger (horseradish, darkly saut\u00e9ed shrooms, steak sauce, dijon mustard, provolone and onion frizzle on a standard bun), and an apple pie shake. I asked for medium, but then I read that all burgers were served medium-well. At $6.59, the price was a little high for the product presented. Quarter pounder without fresh taste, and a ton of spicy additions that were enjoyable (love horseradish on my sliders), but somewhat contradictory on the tongue. The interplay with the steak sauce and dijon was not harmonic with the radish, and appeared to have been absorbed by the mushrooms so that the original earthiness from the cellar dwellers was lost. Not a bad sandwich, but I wasn't in love with it. \n\nI had visions of a real slice of apple pie being placed in a blender with ice cream and milk to create the shake. Not exactly. There were a few small apple slices, and the cinnamon nutmeg flavor, but no crusty bits. The flavor was strong and sweet fun, but would have been completely off the hook with an actual slice of pie. It was comparable to a Shake Shack freeze at a better price, so no real demerits for the shortcut. \n\nThe Five Guys nearby makes a better burger (with double meat), while the shake was very good here. Flip City sound track is mostly classic rock, so the atmosphere is fine. These guys have some tough competition in the burger wars.

Very thin cracker-like crust, mozza cheese under a nicely balanced sauce.  Similar to the pies found in New Jersey, and not the \"upside down\" thing that often is called TP, but is nothing like the real McCoy. So, congrats on getting it right. \n\nService was okay, but there were long stretches of time when no one stopped by to see how we were doing. Long wait for the check, too.

Unfortunately, as with many renditions of FT that use thicker breads, the egg/sugar/vanilla mix had not penetrated beyond the surface, leaving the center bland white and uninvolved in the frying. There was little caramelization to produce crisp edges, likely because the grill was not hot enough under the bread. This, along with table syrup lacking any flavor but sugary sweetness, made for a competent, but uninspired breakfast. \n\nThe free blueberry muffin presented upon payment was a very nice touch, that helped redeem the mediocrity of the morning meal.",

It is a small house with about a dozen tables, and courteous, efficient service and a rapid response kitchen. \n\nOur order of a chaat appetizer (Sev Puri), spinach soup (Palak), chilli chicken and cheese curry (Mughlai Sahi Paneer), with garlic naan, arrived on time and as ordered.  Each had its strength and weaknesses, but overall was a good meal. The chaat was their take on traditional Indian street snacks, with a crisp cracker base, ground veggies and spiced crispies on top. Very good and fun to eat. The spinach soup was sort of a flat dark green broth with interesting flavor, but little body. I bit of cream would likely have really brought it to life. The chilli chicken (dry) was okay, but although said to be dry, was still fairly moist in a heavy goopy sauce. I have had this in several other Indo/Chinese fusion joints, where the chicken had a drier coated finish and a better texture/flavor profile. The paneer dish was rich and flavorful, and was the star of the show. We asked for it moderately spicy, and thought it hit the mark. Finally, the garlic naan was very good. Thinner and crisper than most I had eaten before. The mango lassi was a thick smoothie with crumbled cashews on top. A tad expensive, but a delicious suck. \n\nSpice Rack is pretty far out of my way, so it is unlikely I will return. There are many better and more consistent Indian kitchens in and around Bucks County, so unless your in the hood, there are plenty of other choices. \n\nHidden? Yes.  Gem? Not really.",

    "text": "COVID-19 TAKEOUT REVIEW -\n\nIt was Saturday night and time for a break from extreme social distancing and constant home cooking.  We opted to go Italian with a family sized order from La Villa Pizza & Family Restaurant, Morrisville, PA. Housed in a former Pizza Hut in the parking lot of a small strip center, they are now open until 9 every night to care for the community. Although about 10 miles from home, their reputation for delicious tomato pie made the drive worthwhile. \n\nIt was eerie with the roads bereft of cars and seeing the occasional driver wearing a mask, but this is the way it is in the Days of Coronavirus. \n\nWe ordered in advance their Tradizionale Tomato Pie (dollops of chunky tomato sauce over mozza with plenty of Sweet Sausage), Chicken Parm, Sausage Pepper and Onion Sandwiches, and Steak Stromboli (basically a folded pizza loaded with Cheesesteak, Mozza and Red Sauce). I put on my newly designed and home constructed mask (formerly an old shirt), feeling vaguely like a bandito about to holdup the stagecoach, and went inside. My order was ready, so I completed the transaction with a credit card and plastic glove I carry around in my car for such purposes. \n\nI always remind myself that carryout is almost never as good as eating at the source. This was so for this meal. While the tomato pie was still very good, it was no longer hot and needed more time in our oven to revive. Once reheated, it was fine. Same can't be said for the sammies, nor stromboli. There was far too much globby cheese atop the chicken parmigiana, and too little red sauce. The sausage was a motherload, but what happened to the pepper and onion? Sparse is the first word that comes to mind. And, the stomboli was huge, but again was mostly goo clumps of Mozza completely out of proportion to the meat component. We tossed out half the cheese just to make it edible. \n\nThis morning we got creative. We put the other half of the sausage sandwich sans bread into a frying wok, added fresh sliced red onion, green pepper and garlic and three eggs, to create a great hobo egg dish. It was far better than the dinner the night before. \n\nMoral of this story: Stick to the tomato pie and disregard the rest.",

    "text": "This new version of Ho Sai Gai (Prosperity), is so much nicer than the old one I visited several decades ago.  Small and cozy, it is clean, bright and friendly.  There is a full bar if that is the direction you want to go.  Their hours are long into the night to capture some of the after hours crowd, and their offerings compare well to the competition across the street.  \n\nThere are both English and Chinese menus.  Their contents are somewhat different.  While the English version is similar to most Chinese/American offerings (read: non-authentic), the alternative book stays truer to what the Chinese diner looks for.  It should also be noted that this is a Taiwanese-styled kitchen, which brings it closer to Cantonese plates in taste, but also providing a few dishes that are more uniquely from Taipei.  \n\nThe three of us were handed the English menus, which were quickly exchanged for Chinese when we explained that most of us only spoke English as a second language.  We ordered 3 dishes; two with Pork, Beef, Veggies and Rice or Tofu and Mushrooms in Brown Sauce, and a Crispy Pork Chop on top of a thick dark and flavorful sauce.  They were all decent, although none of us thought the meals exceptional.  The meats were well cooked on the first plate, but my other friend found her dish too salty.  My Pork Chop was a big, coated and fried slab with bone, but a bit passed prime, and seemingly dry.  \n\nStill, we consumed most of everything, enjoying our conversation.  The pot of hot tea was great to see delivered to our table as part of the presentation, and without added cost.  We are not fond of the Fried Noodles on the table for dipping in Duck Sauce, and had them removed to avoid caloric temptation.  \n\nThe sweet spot for Ho Sai Gai appears to be its late night business.  Its mid-afternoon weekend lunch, not so much.",

    "text": "Pottstown, Pa., is an interesting old city.  We dropped into it late in the afternoon after a day in the heat of French Creek State Park and Hopewell Furnace National Historic Site.  I was feeling the effects of the 90F temp, and needed hydration and a little nourishment.  \n\nFirst choice was a tour of Yuengling Brewery, but I had confused Pottsville with Pottstown, and would have been too late anyway. (Should have looked further and found Sly Fox Brewery, but that will have to wait.)  Second choice was to find the nearest dairy bar and settle in for some fresh cool creamy ice cream and a burger.  Yelp Search found Coventry Parlor at Laurel Locks, not 10 minutes away from Main Street.  Not too many reviews, but a little more pioneering today wouldn't hurt.  \n\nActually in Coventry Township, the Laurel Locks refer to both the canal built there to connect with the Schuylkill River canal system, and the large farm that took root there in the early 18th Century.  Another little remembered historic fact was that this area was the home of the a small religious sect called the Stubblebines, whose moral code allowed nudity and cohabitation; giving this locale the name, \"Free Love Valley,\" in the early 19th Century.  It all got out of control, with murder and jealousy rampant.  The group died out by the mid 1800's, when self- proclaimed prophet, Hannah Williamson, caught the last wagon train out of town heading west.  \n\nSo, we settled on a couple of burgers and split a Cashew Raspberry Shake.  The shake was thick with nuts and ice cream, and was quite refreshingly creamy sweet.  The burgers were something else.  Past well done, they were crunchy and almost beyond redemption.  I was too weary to bring it to the server's attention.  It came with store bought bun, cheap chips (not even Herr's), and a soft pickle.  \n\nIf not for affording the opportunity to learn about the fascinating history of this community, I would have departed disappointed by the grub here.  I just won't look past the front retail ice cream shop next time, should that come to pass.",

It is located in a sprawling commercial center parking lot, and is easy to see, but a bit harder to navigate to through the lot. \n\nLike any mid-range casual dining franchise, there is a sameness to every plant.  While this may have been cozy and \"intimate\" at one time, today it feels tired, like an old home in need of new furniture and fresh paint.  The formula is dated.  The menu looked the same as when I visited other Applebees' a decade ago.  I guess I shouldn't argue with success, such as it is.  On this day, the customer profile seemed to primarily be grandparents and their grandkids. \n\nIn keeping with the \"Oldies But Goodies\" theme, I ordered the same Oriental Salad with Chicken as I had ten years ago.  My partner for the meal went with one of their burgers.  Not unexpectedly, my lunch looked and tasted the same as last time, although the bowl was now colorful rather than white.  While we were not there to discuss the food, I did learn that the burger was satisfying. \n\nI don't feel as critical of this joint as many others here, although I am not enthusiastic about it, either.  It provided a decent meal, service and price in a reasonable time, and in a comfortable setting.  \n\nWhile this shop and its brethren will not make my short list of desirable dining, I will not turn up my nose if someone wants to go there.",

    "text": "Angelo's is a lovely local Italian establishment on 2nd Street Pike in the heart of the Southampton commercial district.  The reviews show they have the devotion of a lot of people living in the area.  After 30 years that is to be expected and it is well deserved.\n\nThe facility is fairly large, with ample privacy for the tables.  The staff is exceptionally friendly and attentive.  The menu is traditional Italian-American fare, with many pizza options, Parms, Alfredo's, Marsala's, etc.  Prices are very reasonable.\n\nMy son and I went there last night for the first time.  He had the Chicken Parm, with Minestone Soup; I the Pizza Rustica (small).  The accompanying Italian bread was very tasty, with enough thin crusty crispiness to be enjoyable in taste and bite.  I really enjoyed it with a smear of sweet butter.  It was served warm. \n\nSon's Parm, was excellent.  The breast was pounded and breaded with a pleasant bread crumb mix, and covered in a heavy fresh tomato sauce.  He was rolling his eyes in delight.  If anything was off, perhaps, the spaghetti side was a bit mushy (he gave me a taste of everything so I could review it).   The Minestone was rich with veggies, pasta and a little beef.  Very good.\n\nThe Pizza Rustica was hand-pulled, with fresh Basil, Garlic, chunky Tomatoes, and a heavy Mozzarella finish.  It was good.  Now, pizza is a very personal and subjective taste.  We are all experts.  Some may love this style, but for me it left something to be desired.  I prefer my pizza to have a thin, but firm crust that does not bend or fold under the weight of the toppings.  This one suffered from cheese overload, and required a knife and fork.  It was tasty, but the cheese overwhelmed the other flavors and softened the firmness I prefer. I added crushed hot pepper and garlic powder, which was helpful.  \n\nWe will certainly come again and see what else is cooking.  I will tell the waitress more about my pizza preferences, and perhaps, we can reach an accommodation. A good chef appreciates a customer's positive input.  Given all the other positives,\nAngelo's may yet become as special to me as it has been to so many long time patrons.",

I did not see it on the menu, but that is what I had a craving for, and I suspected the kitchen knew how to make it. \n\nI sat in the corner near the door and shared the attractive floor with three other occupied tables.  It was a cold and quiet night.  My server took a few minutes to find me, but she was courteous, efficient and prompt.  The Side Salad came out first.  It was small with a nice Spring Mix, if a bit light on the house Italian dressing.  Just greens. No cheese, nuts, dried fruit. Basic salad. \n\nThe two small dinner rolls were housemade and quite good with a crunchy crust and mildly salty flavor.  \n\nThe wide brimmed white bowl of pasta was adequate, if not generous.  The spinach was cut into smaller pieces and fully saut\u00e9ed into the oil and garlic.  Tasty.  The pool of oil at the bottom of the bowl was perhaps more than expected, but it did not detract from the al dente Rigatones that were bathing in it.  The garlic taste was strong although not a lot of the bulb was showing in the dish.  \n\nThe meal was competent and filling, if not memorable.  There was a lack of energy emanating from the food. It did not visibly shine as many good meals do. Maybe it was the cold night, or the sparse occupancy, but the experience was flat.  Given the cost of this simple meal ($17), I guess I anticipated something more dynamic. \n\nThat I could not get an internet signal in the house compounded this impression.",

It sits in a 4 shop strip commercial building with a pizza parlor, and dance studio.  \n\nWalking in, there is plenty of room in the brightly lit space.  Part of that is because there is no where to sit down to enjoy your creamies.  There are two benches out front, but it would be uncomfortable to hang there is cold or wet weather.  Don't know why they don't want people hanging around in the shop.  It would seem to be the best way to keep folks happy coming there.  \n\nI sampled a small cup with a scoop of Peanut Butter Ripple and Pumpkin (Pie).  At $2.85, the price was downright 1980! The service from the owner was friendly and efficient.  He told me he had been at this location for 6 years, and another nearby place, 9 years more.  That's a lot of ice cream cones and shakes.  \n\nCone Heads doesn't make its own product, but uses several vendors depending on the flavors available.  That is both a strength and a weakness.  It certainly saves money not to invest in equipment, and provides flexibility in purchasing.  Yet, it reduces flavor and quality control by putting it in foreign hands.  I could taste the difference.  While the Peanut Butter Ripple was very good with a lot of peanut butter throughout its vanilla base, the Pumpkin had much less taste and creaminess, and was so subtle that I did not recognize it at first.  It was only when I came across pieces of pie crust in the mix that I realized that I was dealing with pumpkin pie ice cream, not merely the orange gourd.  \n\nThis place could be so much more than it is, if it standardized its inventory to better manufacturers, and made the house more comfortable for folks to sit around and enjoy their sundaes and malts.",

If you want a beer with that, than RR is your only option.  If great shakes are a priority, Chee Chee is the better way to go.  \n\nHere, the ambiance is all ersatz 1950's diner-esqueness.  Very similar to Nifty Fifty, Johnnie Rocket's, Jake's Wayback, and the like.  I forgive them the weak attempt at historical orientation, as the actual product is pretty good.  \n\nThe burgers and fries are fresh, not frozen at the start, and the end result is a decent (not great) burger experience.  Compared to 5 Guys, it falls a little short in the taste department (not enough tasty grease), but it compensates with more menu variety (chicken, salads), and additional treats to put on the burger (banana chilies, shrooms, pickles, etc.).  The shakes are very good, and they will add malt powder for no additional charge if asked.  Really, creamy and tasty. \n\nBottom line - Worth the trip and money when you want a good nostalgia burger.",

The menu is extensive, particularly if you like Vietnamese dishes or Pho.  Portions are large.  Prices are low.  Very popular combination that keeps the two floors busy day and night.  Just don't spend time looking at the floor around your table, because cleanliness is an issue.  The house hasn't been inspected by L & I for a long time, and it shows. \n\nStill, it is mind over matter.  If you don't mind the grit around you, it doesn't matter.  Just enjoy the plentitude so light on your wallet.  \n\nWe were there for a late lunch and stayed with the soup.  My partner had the Pho Special that contained all the meats available in the kitchen, and I their Bun Bo Hue.  They label the sizes of their bowls as large and extra large, as if that was something everyone understood.  The former would be a large bowl in most establishments, and the later, a fish bowl.  We couldn't finish either.  \n\nThe Pho broth was decent; full of noodles and a load of meat.  It was tasty, but lacked some of the more subtle flavors associated with the better noodle soups.  I did not taste Anise, although it could have been in there.  My Bun Bo was stocked with three big Pig's Feet (Glad they left him one on the hoof), plus slices of Beef and shreds of Pork.  It had ample Lemongrass for the strong spiciness that makes this so distinctive, Fermented Shrimp Paste for sourness,  plus Onions, Mint, and a few unidentified floating objects.  I did not detect Coriander, Rock Sugar, nor Congealed Pig Blood (thankfully), which are part of the totally authentic mix.  The side dish accompaniments had the usual Sprouts, Thai Basil, Jalapeno Slices and Lime Wedges, but was missing the Banana Blossom Slices, and/or Red Cabbage.  \n\nStill, it was pretty good; the first spoonful paralyzing my vocal cords so I could only whisper for about 15 minutes.  It wasn't the best BBH I have had in the City, but it wasn't the worst.  Given the complexity of the real deal, perhaps it was unfair of me to expect Pho Xe Lua to get it completely right.  \n\nService was fine, and our server was multilingual, making my Mandarin speaking friend happy with his descriptions in her native tongue. \n\nNo need to run back here, but its broad non-Chinese menu makes it a reasonable alternative when in Chinatown, but not feeling like Chinese food.",

Having visited the Bordentown shop and been happy with their Tomato Pie, I wanted to try them all.  \n\nThis Italian palace sits on the bottom of Klockner Road.  It is a nice space, if dated, but it definitely harkens to another time when these places were full of locals; the men around the bar, and families in the dining rooms eating home cooked Roman meals.  It certainly has its charm and could easily fit into Chambersburg, if Chambersburg was still Chambersburg. \n\nI sat alone at the bar for a late lunch and ordered their Bar Tomato Pie with Sausage.  I was entertained by an array of large HDTVs above the back bar and the outer walls. It was a rectangular bar with seating on 4 sides.  I liked the lay out.  When the Pie arrived it looked beautiful - steaming with bright red chunky crushed Tomato and a nice spread of crumbled Sweet Sausage.  Rather than serving it on an aluminum pizza oven pan, it was presented on a large round white platter.  \n\nThe outer crust was golden, cracker crisp and delicious.  Yet, the center of the pie had condensation between it and the cooler plate.  this caused dampening of the undercrust, and when I went to pick a slice up, the gravy, cheese and sausage slid off the base onto the plate, leaving just the white crust in my hand.  It still tasted good, but it did detract from the overall enjoyment of the pie.  I learned why most pizza shops serve their pies on the metal tray, to hold heat and reduce condensation. \n\nI would certainly return to Palermo's if I found myself in that neighborhood, but there are so many other very good to excellent pie emporiums in Hamilton that there is no need to settle for less that total wonderful excellence when only a tomato pie will still the savage beast.",

The sausage, egg and cheese biscuit is super tasty and textured, so every bite is a pleasure.  The fresh biscuits are flakey and have a mild buttery flavor.  \nThe best thing offered are the shakes.  They claim to be \"hand spun,\" whatever that means.  The taste is wonderful with the right amount of sweetness and creaminess.  Their season special shakes are fun on St. Patrick's Day (green minty), late summer (peach), and fall (pumpkin).  They are a little expensive compared to the drink alternatives, but a palate pleaser. \nI am not a regular here, but there is a time when it offers exactly what I want.",

    "text": "BREAKFAST ONLY REVIEW -\n\nReno's is basically a pizza take out joint on very old (and nearly decrepit) business route one in Penndel, PA. There are two small tables in front, but upon talking with the one man on duty (owner?), it was apparent that their business plan had changed to a stripped down pizza-to-go operation. Even the sign offering breakfast was misleading, as they would still grill up a morning sandwich, but lacked a means to provide hot coffee to customers. So, my idea to sit down for a quick early bite was denied by the lack of the essential beverage. \n\nStill, the sausage, egg and cheese on Kaiser roll was pretty good, with fried egg and white American cheese. The roll was more a potato roll than the described German loaf, but was actually better than the anticipated bake would have been. Just would have preferred not to eat it in the car. \n\nCan't speak to Reno's pizza or other Italian plates, but the sammy itself was an enjoyable chew.",

    "text": "Stumbled on Trent City Pizzeria on my way back from court. I had stopped to pick up fresh coffee at Trenton Coffee House, and continued down Cass Street until I turned onto Lamberton Street to head back to the office. I didn't remember a restaurant being there.  It looked new and shiny.  Decided the time was right for lunch, so I parked on the street in front of the shop and went in.  \n\nIt was indeed a new store.  Four booths. Seven stools along the walls. A big kitchen in back, separated by glass counters and work space.  Everyone spoke Spanish, and Telemundo was on the tube, yet the menu was all Italian with Spanish specials behind the counter for the asking. I went with my old standby, eggplant parm sandwich.  I sat and waited.  A couple of local street dudes came in for a bite.  We all fiddled with our smart phones waiting for our food.  \n\nThe nightshade was pretty good.  Plenty of thin sliced eggplant, breaded and saut\u00e9ed in olive oil.  Tender and nice taste.  The red sauce was ample, as was the mozzarella melted on top.  The roll was crisp from the oven's warm embrace.  It was a big sandwich, and came with fries. Left most of those behind to concentrate on the star of the show.  \n\nWith a Snapple, lunch was $9 and small change.  Thought it good enough to warrant a return visit to sample the pizza, and perhaps a cheesesteak or Italian Hot Dog.",

    "text": "Until checking Yelp, I always thought of The Brick Hotel in Newtown, Pa., as both the first floor restaurant/bar and upstairs bed & breakfast.  Apparently, it is separated by function on this site.  Still, for more than 200 years it has been known in the community only as The Brick Hotel; the hotel made of bricks. Historically famous for its existence during the Revolutionary War (Yes. George Washington was there for many meetings and meals during his wintering in the area after being expelled from New York by the British, and before decisively crossing the Delaware River and surprising the Hessians in Trenton on Christmas Day, 1776.)  \n\nAlthough somewhat modernized with large enclosed dining space on what was a wrap around porch, the structure is very well preserved inside and out, and it is easy to imagine what it was like 250 years ago.  That is also the main problem here.  Most of the upstairs bedrooms seem to have remained unchanged since the 18th or 19th Century, and it is looking pretty worn out in the 21st. It was recently the focus of an episode of Hotel Hell, but despite the free publicity and promises, little has changed since that exposure.  So, unless you enjoy such ambiance and reported ghost sightings, this may not be the place you want to rest your head. \n\nOn the other hand, the large first floor dining room makes a very nice place for a gathering for up to 100 people.  I have attended several public meetings and fundraisers there, and have enjoyed them all.  The barroom is small, but beautifully appointed.  You can pick up your open bar wine or beer there, and stroll into the meeting room to chat with folks before the speakers take the floor.  Too, there are usually a few tables with oer d'oeuvres to quiet those stomach rumblings so often associated with rubber chicken experiences (speaking of the politics, not the food).  \n\nSo, if you find yourself in the area, and enjoy American history and pleasant surroundings, you might consider stopping in for a drink.  There are several other very strong bars/taverns/restaurants on State Street for you to visit and indulge.  The Brick Hotel is not a bad place to begin or end your adventure.  \n\nTell them \"George\" sent you.",

    "text": "Donuts seem to be making a comeback after years of suffering through the likes of Dunkin and other over extended chains turning out mimeographic fry dough, that are little more than a standard platform for applying a variety of colored sugar. Yawn!\n\nPlaces like Factory Donuts have the right idea.  Make the donuts just in time for the customer to receive them hot from the oil bath and customized on the spot to suit their taste.  It works for burgers and pizza, why not for other fun comfort food? It is an idea whose time has come. \n\nOf course, it really helps if the overall experience contributes to the enjoyment of the finished product.  Here, that is not quite the case. I noticed that the rounders were smaller than found in most other outlets; and more expensive. If you are going to charge over a buck for one of these babies, shouldn't each one be magnificent in taste, texture and size?  Not only were they diminutive compared to the competition, but the apparent variety of flavors was not quite real. To my tongue several varieties had different colors, but more or less the same taste.  That pretty red one was no different than that pretty purple one with sprinkles. \n\nHocus pocus. \n\nI don't know about you, but I love a good cup of Joe with my glazed sugar fix. The java at the factory doesn't stand up. It is a bland commercial blend that does not contribute to the enjoyment of the moment. For a premium price, there should also be a premium bean. \n\nFinally, when I buy a box of six donuts, I don't expect to eat them all immediately.  I will sample one to taste it warm, and wait a bit for the rest, sometimes until the next day to consume them all with help of friends and family.  The first one eaten while I was still in their parking lot was terrific.  Fresh cake out of the kitchen, glaze barely set to hardening - a pleasant jolt on the tongue. Teased and almost seduced. Yet, by that evening the thrill was gone, even with a short burst in the microwave. Come the next morning, there was little to enjoy beyond scraping the excess icing from the bottom of the box for the mouth rush hardened sugar provides. \n\nIt wasn't a complete fiasco, as watching the donuts being made and customized was fun, and they were truly very good right off the assembly line.  If they would up their game on the coffee, I would return knowing that I should only buy what could be eaten within an hour or so. Under those conditions, Factory Donuts would be a hit.",

The only ray of light in the area of 15th Street is the corner Dunkin Donuts.

The drivers stand around outside or sit within, chatting in their native tongues, and sipping the local brew.  All this adds to the color of the joint.  \n\nThe coffee is pretty much standard issue DD.  Never great. Always adequate. The bakery offerings are below average, as if they are being made by people who don't really get the donut concept.  Maybe that's the way the cabbies like them. \n\nIt's hard to get excited about any Dunkin, and this one is no different.  \n\nAny caffeine in a storm.",

No wonder successive owners have tried to make a go of a comfortable retreat here.  It is really quite lovely, especially before dusk when the western orientation raises a curtain on some magnificent sunsets. This was my first meal at Erini and I looked forward to the opportunity to enjoy a repast in the large and well appointed dining rooms of the past. \n\nWalking in past the well fed cats, I soon saw that little had changed within. Same bar crowded at happy hour, and same spacious dining area.  Although we were early, the hostess easily sat us at a nice table, and the server brought us menus and took our drink order.  Seemless. We ordered the Grilled Salmon and Chicken Marsala, foregoing apps and sides in the expectation that we would have a substantial dinner. \n\nAnd, substantial they were.  Both plates were large - steamy, colorful  and textural  in presentation. We dug in.  Not to bring you down too quickly, but nothing was quite as good as it at first appeared. The Salmon, although a nice size steak, was not first quality according to my companion.  She found it too \"fatty,\" and less than the tight morsel she desired.  Good sauce, nice Roasted Potatoes, but still disappointing. My Marsala has a similar story.  The chicken was slightly overcooked in the fry pan and lacked moistness. The sauce, though plentiful, was monotonal and lacking finesse.\n\n It was all good, but not good enough to make me a fan. Kudos to the staff that was professional and engaging. The Happy Hour trade is a success, and perhaps that is where the sweet spot is at Erini.",

My Egg Foo Young was thick and loaded with Veggie and Pork.  The Brown Sauce seemed identical to all the others I have tried in such joints.  The Pork Fried Rice had the brown tint of beef stock base, and the Egg Roll was mostly cabbage with a bit of something else - perhaps, pork. \n\nAt least, China Garden seemed cleaner than many of the others.  Too, it is obviously a family place because the owner's son was on site and helping out, though he seemed no more than 12.  \n\nThe people are friendly, are fully bilingual, and the prices seem like from the 1990's, perhaps because they have been there so long and making a go of it in part because of the low rent on that strip of Broad Street.  \n\nIt's not the place to take a date, but it is certainly decent enough for a combo lunch or cheap and filling dinner.  \n\nGarden? Can't see the connection from out front or inside.  But, maybe they all fly away to a secret place at night, or have a small cultivated plot out back.",

The joint is cozy with small dining area, self serve coffee and very reasonable prices. It's a nice place to hang out with friends and family (if you can find a table). \n\nDownside is that their bagel style is not my fave. They are on the small side and more densely textured than I prefer. To my buds, they taste like sour dough loaf with thin shell and lots of sprinkles (onion being my primary choice). The quality is there, but I jump for a lighter, air-pocketed inside, crisper shell and less sour flavor. It comes down to the base flour used and the amount of kneading before forming the ring of dough that becomes the bagel. Like pie crust, less is more when it comes to great texture. \n\nEveryone behind the counter was pleasant and having a good time when I was there. That's always a good sign for a positive atmosphere. If they made the kind of bagels I loved, I would stop in regularly. As it is, Bagel Train in Yardley will continue to be my station for awesome bagels in Bucks County.",

Man, where were the urban planners when we needed them? Recently with all the bad weather drivers have been too busy dodging potholes to notice that the entire zone is really one Grand Canyon sized pothole. Once safely in the parking lot the challenge becomes finding a slot for your wheels.  The lot is undersized for the capacity of the facility, but if you drive behind the building and turn right, you might get lucky.  \n\nOnce inside, the familiarity of Diner World takes control and you know what needs be done.  Wait to be seated at booth or table, or slide past the throng at the door, turn right, and take a spinning stool at the counter - no waiting. So moved.  I was promptly greeted by a kind waitress in black and white who deposited a multi paged breakfast menu and inquired about a drink.  Coffee, please.  She turned and poured mine into a white mug from the antique Cecilware Auto Coffee Urn.  Can't get those any more, but back in the day they were the best way to make large volumes of java. Still great Joe. She returned often to refill.  \n\nI ordered the Whole Wheat French Toast.  It arrived on white oval industrial ceramic, dusted with powdered sugar.  The middle slice of bread stood on edge mid-plate, like a mainsail mast in a sea of Maple Syrup.   The bread was fresh and a thick cut.  It was super absorbent.  No matter how much syrup I pour on it, there was nothing at the bottom of the plate to sop up with the FT.  Three additional pours and still not a drop.  Oh, but the meal got sweeter.  I was impressed.  \n\nIn years of French Toast sampling, I have come to prefer a thinner sliced bread over the thicker version, because the egg absorbs more completely, and with a hot grill carmelization takes place where hot metal cauterizes the egg/bread surfaces, creating a mild crispiness.  Still, this stuff was pretty good for thick cut, and I had no complaints.  \n\nClearly, Suburban Diner has its loyal followers.  A look around the dining room disclosed a predominance of seniors, some with children and grandkids.  The place seemed wholesome. The bakery turned out some pretty cakes and pies.  Maybe next time for that.  \n\nWith \"I Love Lucy\" playing in black and white on the TV, it was easy to slip into a time warp and imagine myself in a Back to The Future moment.  \n\nI enjoyed the experience on several levels, but I am not sure I would put Suburban Diner on my short list of fandom.",

    "text": "We have the original Piccolo Trattoria in Newtown, PA, and watched with satisfaction as it succeeded to the extent of opening a second restaurant in Pennington, NJ., and now creating a new concept in Italian dining - fast casual, build your own pizza/pasta/salad.  Fahmi is a great guy, and deserves his good fortune.  \n\nI stopped in this afternoon to finally sample something from this new venture.  Not in the mood for designing my own personal pizza on this 90+ degree day, I decided to try a simple pasta dish - Penne Aglio Olio w/ Sauteed Spinach.  That combination was put together in the mostly open kitchen as I waited at the cashier to pay for lunch.  Yelp had a check in gift of a free soft drink, which was easily negotiated in exchange for a 16 ounce paper cup (regular price, $2.50). \n\nThe store is very bright with a wall of windows, high ceiling, and plenty of lighting. There are large sign on every wall with menus, instructions for building your meal, and goodwill sayings and quotes. A serious effort is made to be friendly, informational, and efficient.  I received salutations from most of the employees by the time I left the building. The company also is involved in the community, and makes generous contributions to many local charities. A big check for $6,000+, payable to the Trenton Soup Kitchen, sat in one corner of the dining room. \n\nImpressive and heartwarming! \n\nMy pasta was served in an orange bowl on a metal tray.  Drinks and silverware were available farther down the assembly line beyond the cashier.  It was a good size portion for lunch, with ample olive oil and mashed garlic cloves.  A sprinkle of crushed dried hot and black pepper, and I was looking for a seat near a window. I am obliged to disclose that it was far from the best oglio olio I've ever had, with the garlic not saut\u00e9ed long enough to turn it golden, and thus having a raw flavor rather than the mellowness of well cooked garlic in extra virgin oil.  Too, the spinach was in two large soft clumps, rather than spread throughout the dish.  It was next to impossible to separate the leaves, and the garlic taste did not penetrate to maximize flavor. A little more training in the kitchen would correct this preparation issue.\n\nOverall, I like what Piccolo Pronto is about -  making traditional Italian dishes, pizzas, sandwiches, etc., available at lower cost with good ingredients and friendly service.  A little tinkering with small details could easily bring the final result up a few notches. Certainly the folks around the College of New Jersey have a good place to eat, but I hope for something more enticing to bring me back as a regular customer.",

    "text": "Richboro, PA, is experiencing a big growth spurt with the closing of the Davis Auto Group facility in the center of town and the new businesses being developed in that large space. The cranes and construction workers are still there, but a couple of buildings are finished and the new look downtown is taking shape. Dairy Queen leased the space at the rear of the new office/retail structure at Second Street Pike just off the Bustleton Pike intersection. It is a little hard to find hidden way in back.\n\nThe store itself is fairly small, with two rows of about a dozen booths and tables in front, cashier and kitchen in back and soda service area against the rear wall. Service is young, friendly and accommodating. The order taker was kind enough to point out that as I was there before 2, their $5 and $6 lunch specials were still in play. Cheeseburger, fries, soft drink and small sundae for a fin was good deal, so I went for it, except I knew I couldn't handle the dessert, so he gave me a coupon for a free one instead. Much appreciated. He even permitted me to swap the carbonated beverage for a small blizzard without upcharge. \n\nThe package was okay when delivered to my booth, but not really inspiring. Fries were hot and crisp. The bun was not grilled, nor heated and could have used something to improve its plain white bread texture and taste. The 3 oz. burger was decent with onion, lettuce and tomato topping. The shake was a shallow imitation of the thick, rich and creamy 'Zzard of my childhood. Too watery. Not much flavor. A disappointment. Maybe something was missed in the downsizing for lunch. The whipped cream on top was more dominant that the mix beneath. \n\nSo, while I might return, I would skip the cheap deal and go for their full bore burgers and blizzards to see if those were true to the DQ Brazier creed.\n\n Life is too short for boring burgers.",

The world around it may have changed, but this establishment has not, except for a few architectural modifications to accommodate the uses to which it was being put.  \n\nThis is both good and not so. Walking into the tavern area throws you into the Eighteenth Century, where the local Sons of Liberty gathered to plot the Revolution. Downside, the beer selection is from the same era.  The dining area is also dated to about 1890.  The menu is solid for a 1960's kitchen.  Everything is well prepared and tasty, but if you want something in the way of vegetarian, vegan, or even contemporary cuisine, it will be hard to find. The burgers, traditional Italian, and usual suspects are present.  As long as that is what you want, you will be satisfied.  \n\nToday I tried the Italian Sausage with Peppers and Onions in red sauce over Linguini for a lunch special. At $7.99 the price was right.  I enjoyed the meal, but there was nothing memorable about it. We turned lunch into a work meeting and remained for  more than an hour after we finished eating. The room was practically deserted on a August Friday afternoon.  We were not rushed, and the room was comfortable, if somewhat brown in tone. \n\nA new menu, broader beer options, fresh coat of paint and new carpets would go a long way to bring the Langhorne Hotel a new clientele. But, if they did that, the Sons of Liberty in the tavern might go elsewhere to plot our way to independence. \n\nMaybe we are wise to leave well enough alone.",

It isn't bad, but just can't compare with the local mom and pop kitchens anywhere in eastern Pennsylvania, that give you cuisine right from momma's oven.  \n\nI like the Tuscany-esque high ceiling and heavy timber, as well as the open kitchen.  Service was excellent from \"Big Sean.\" He was on top of all our needs.  \n\nMy lunch special Chicken Parm Sandwich was pretty good, with fresh bird and enjoyable variation of an Italian loaf.  The chicken tasted deep fried rather than pan fried, but the sauce was okay and there was the right proportion of mozza/sauce.  My partner's Italian Pulled Pork was more unusual, but had a mildly sweet taste, and a lot of greens on top as a substitute for the American cole slaw.  I had never heard of BBQ on an Italian menu, and this was no doubt an attempt to capture more diners looking for something not strictly from the Boot.  \n\nThe price for these lunches @ $7, was very good, and allowed us to eat a full and tasty meal at a reasonable price, rather than jumping to the dinner options.  \n\nBottom Line - Not a bad choice for a road stop if you don't know the local haunts with genuine home cooking.",

Go if you like fresh food options in meat, produce, dairy, bread, and Middle Eastern/Mediterranean food,  or Amish-style pickled stuff, sushi, fresh fish, or my favorite BBQ'd everything.  There is a small eating area if you love to snack or have a noisy meal, but otherwise take out is the name of the game. \n\nThe prices are more or LESS competitive with local grocers, but the freshness is what they score with. Also, the Pa Dutch folks who are there, provide a quaintness that makes the exploration a pleasant experience.  \n\nOverall, whether you like it or not depends on your expectations.  Don't think: Reading Terminal, because it is not even close to that in scope.  Think: small time alternative to megamarkets with some local color and fresh food.  With a little creativity and space, it could be so much more. \n\nIf you have the time and enjoy this kind of thing, the Trenton Farmers' Market is much larger and more diverse.

Made from scratch upon ordering so it took 20 minutes for them to be prepared. Next time I'll call ahead to save time. Great to have these near best of breed wings so close at hand, rather than having to travel to another county to get a fix.\n\nYet, that \"Homemade Hamburger\" needs to be reconsidered and hopefully reinvented. It was awful. The ground beef was a poor quality with pieces of fat and other nasties that fell apart upon biting into the sandwich. The slice of red onion was tough and bitter. Their signature burger sauce was okay, but really added nothing positive to the taste. A Sriracha mayo would have been a better option, or something like Russian dressing. The potato wedges were quite good, but it would take alot of convincing to get me to try that thing again. \n\nSo, it was the best of times and the worst of times at CHKN & BBQ.

It is really a Latino Casa that does breakfast and lunch.  The menu is on a large blackboard on the wall.  The gist is mostly burgers named after the automotive universe, with burritos a strong option.  \n\nI was there for a late breakfast around 10:30 am, and went with a Sausage, Egg & Cheese Sandwich on a Kaiser Roll.  At $6 for the sandwich with a small side of Tator Tots and a large Coffee, I thought the price proposition to be very attractive.  I sat at one of the 4 small tables along the front window, facing the wall menu, with the counter to my left and the short order grill just on the other side.  \n\nStanding up to look for the coffee (it was being fresh brewed for me in the back of the kitchen), I observed the cook putting my meal together.  Link sausage was being deep fried before slicing and grilling and lay the groundwork on the base of the roll.  I didn't need the extra oil from using that approach to preparation, but it did not affect the taste.  The same was true for the Tator Tots.  Deep fried and crunchy.  The eggs were fresh and folded flat on the hot steel before being slipped into place on top of the meat.  The cheese went on last and helped seal the fresh roll top to the contents of the creation.  \n\nAll in all, a pretty good sandwich, and better cup of brewed java.  \n\nNext time, I will ask for one of their well-named burgers, as that seems to be their sweet spot.  \n\nThese guys should make it.

My 12 year old son came along when he heard we would go for cheesesteaks.  \n\nThe environment around Pat's is terrific.  People all over the place.  The queue to order.  The Rules for Ordering.  The smack in the puss aroma of burning grease and onions.  The whole migila.  I felt my own excitement rise the closer I came to the ordering window.  I felt the vicarious thrill as my son ordered his first Cheesesteak Witout and Provolone, and a Birch Beer.  Truly, a right of passage. \n\nYet, when we sat down at a red metal grate table and began to devour our sandwiches, I noted my son's displeasure with the amount of fat and gristle he had to  spit out.  I, too, was surprised to find red meat in my tumultuous pile of steak, onions, mushrooms and cheese.  Uncooked.  It felt careless. I did not mind that each time I picked up the load to have a bite, and equal amount fell out the back end of the 'wich. That was to be expected from an unfortunate roll incapable of holding its load.  Still, I did not feel like picking up the canned shrooms  and steak pieces to eat them.  \n\n5 Stars for the institution and historic icon that is Pat's King of Steaks. \n2 Stars for the actual product generated from this amazing operation.  \n\n3 Stars for the King who needs to look in the mirror and realize he may be wearing only his reputation.",

It is not as big as I was expecting, but well maintained and definitely creates its own unique carnival-like atmospherics.  \n\nStopped in for breakfast recently and took a seat at the counter.  Big breakfast menu, and a cup of coffee were placed in front of me before I had a chance to squirm to a comfortable position on the spinner.  Impressive attentiveness.  The servers wore smiles and were warmly engaging.  \n\nI opted for a breakfast sandwich on a Kaiser roll.  I thought that was all I would get for the reasonable price.  However, my waitperson then asked if I wanted Home Fries or Fresh Fruit with it.  Potatoes or fruit on top of what was already a big bite.  Thinking quickly for that time of day, I suppressed my surprise and inquired if it was possible to have half of each.  I wanted to sample more.  She nodded in appreciation.  \n\nNow, most Sausage, Egg and Cheese 'wiches come with a single sausage patty, one fried egg, and a slice or two of American cheese.  Not this baby.  It came with two patties, one egg, and a load of melted cheese that had to be three or four slices.  The Home Fries took up a third of the large plate, and the Fruit Cup was a nice mix of Cantelope, Watermelon, Pineapple, Grapes, Blackberries and Strawberries.  \n\nNeedless to say, this was more than a single meal, and much more than I wanted to consume early in the morning, so I tasted a bit of everything, but could not finish anything.  I had a momentary qualm about the over the top quantity of food, the obesity epidemic in the US, and starvation elsewhere.  It felt excessive and indulgent.  \n\nWhile everything tasted good, if I return I will make a conscious effort to ask them to give me less.",

The previous tenants lasted as long as their leases and succumbed to the poor location at the ass end of a run down strip, it's nearly invisible from the main roads and a tiny floor space that had little room for dining in. \n\nStill, this iteration has a chance, if they maintain reasonable standards of taste and cleanliness and do a little advertising. I found the interaction with the woman owner to be pleasant. She took my phone order of Crispy Orange Chicken (extra spicy, with fried rice and Wonton Soup) graciously and had it ready moments after my arrival as discussed. \n\nHere's my rundown of the this lunch special -\n\nCrispy Orange Chicken had a pretty good sauce, and the cut chicken was plentiful, as was the rice. Problem was that the crispiness was gone by the time I opened the plastic container because both were mixed together, rather than keeping bird and sauce separate until consumed at final destination. Too, but for this premature exposure, the chicken could have been left dry with a little ventilation to allow excess moisture to escape as the food cooled. Still a tasty dish, but could have been so much better without the soggies. \n\nWonton Soup was less redeeming. The wontons were thick skinned and filled with mystery meat. The beef stock in which they swam was aging rapidly and lacked much to applaud. It was hot, so I'll give it that. \n\nFried Rice was the largest part of the combo. It was okay, with enough pork and veggies to warrant some merit, but I left most of it behind as unwanted starch. \n\nThere was nothing unusual about the meal, although the price was inexpensive. Happy China falls into the overall Average range of Chinese American takeout. It would be hard to find much better in similar joints, and much easier to find worse.",

Adequate parking and nicely remodeled interior with those colorful carved chair backs and murals depicting the bright life made famous in all the pastel paintings sold on the streets of almost every small villa in Mexico.  Looking for a place to pick up a good meal, I picked this one because of strong reviews and relative proximity. \n\nBottom line - It lost something in-between house and store, as many carry-outs do. Sitting in aluminum containers and covered to keep in all the moisture, it was no longer as fresh and crisp as they would have been if eaten right there. \n\nThe Steak Fajitas were plentiful, but overcooked and too chewy when eaten at our kitchen table. Far too well-done and dried out. The side salad, guac and crema tasted good, but couldn't revive what was already deceased. Luckily, the Los Coco's Special (two beef/chicken quesadillas with red rice) was much better, especially with salsa roja generously applied over top. Very satisfied. \n\nNeither dish came with the promised side tortillas. \n\nThe Chip & Salsa was a hefty bag of corn crunchies and fresh tomato, jalapeno, cilantro in a large plastic bowl. They were a strong compliment. \n\nNo doubt this meal would have been better if we had spoken with a server about how to finish the steak (medium), and done without the grillman scorch them to well done. It's hard to get it right when the only dialogue is over the phone, and all you see is a packed up brown paper sack with your name on it upon arrival.

Give them your phone number to find your account (or make one), and give them a name and city where you want to send your package, and in a second they have all the known names/addresses there, and you select the right one.  \n\nSmall world and getting smaller by the minute. \n\nThe only real downside is the expense of using their services.  I just spend $70 to send a very small package to California overnight.  Makes me think I should set up an account directly with FedEx or UPS. \n\n This charge felt like I had just been held up on the stage coach from Bisbee to Tombstone. These robbers didn't even bother to wear masks.  But, I sure felt someone's hand in my pocket.",

    "text": "Massimo's Caf\u00e9 sits at the point where Hamilton Ave. and Liberty Street merge in Hamilton Township.  Sitting in this primo location, Massimo's is a solid Italian lunch and dinner restaurant where you can sit down, fill up, and depart sated on a fairly small budget.  The food is what you would expect from one of the better Italian-influenced cities - Trenton, which sits a few blocks away.  The facility was recently renovated and the inside is attractive is a basic sort of way.  This is not a tablecloth joint, but the tables and chairs are spread sufficiently, and the atmosphere is casual. Nonna sits by the register most days, and adds to the Mange mentality here. \n\nMy lunch this week with a friend consisted of Eggplant Parm sandwich, fries, and ice tea.  My lunch mate had the Chicken Parm variant.  The torpedo rolls were fresh and crusty, made crunchy by a turn in the oven before serving.  The Eggplant was plentiful and tasty.  The gravy slightly sweet, which I prefer.  We were both happy with our choices.  The fries were...fries.\n\nService was good, but I did feel sorry for our wait person who had to cover the floor by herself with more than 8 tables occupied. Still, she provided service with a smile. Tipped her well for her effort. \n\nWhen in the area I would certainly consider dinner here, but until I do and have a few more things on the menu, Massimo's gets Three Stars with a bullet.",

Ray is the chief cook and bottle washer, and his better half runs the front of the house.  She is a stitch, with a load of funnies to crack, followed by a horse (hoarse) laugh that is infectious.  \n\nThe house itself feels rather dark, with a small counter toward the back where I settled in earlier this week for breakfast.  Perhaps more lighting would dispel the sense that the back area needs a thorough cleaning. Still, the coffee was strong and plentiful, and the French Toast available as a Short Stack, which was all I wanted.  Ray came out to the grill to prepare the meal.  The dish was decent, if a little \"eggy,\" around the edges. My compliment to the chef was met with a smile before he retreated back to his enclave.  \n\nRay's is a place with some old world charm, but a bit disheveled.  The prices are in line with the atmosphere, so there is definitely a deal to be made on an inexpensive meal.  Still, Mt. Holly is a happening place this century, and there are more than a few better stops for a memorable morning meal. \n\nI would return, but not anytime soon.",

Of course, there are other diners on Broad Street, so don't be confused.\n\nThis place has been well renovated to match its new moniker, and although smaller than the better known places like Mastoris and Town and County a few miles away, it is still comfortable, although the tables are fairly close together. \n\nI was there for a late lunch last week, and the floor was mostly empty.  I was greeted with a smile by a waitress and the cashier, and led to a deuce in the side dining room. A second waitress brought me a menu and informed me where to look for specials. She promptly brought water and lemon, and returned again moments later to take my order of Greek Turkey Burger on Pita.  The platter came out with the grilled pita on the bottom of the plate, and the burger on top of it. It was up to me to make it a sandwich, which I opted not to do.  There was a small plastic cup of fresh feta cheese, and tachini sauce in another, so I could use what I wanted. Lettuce and Jersey Tomato sat on the edge of the plate.  At first, I was a little put off that the finished product was not constructed in the kitchen, but as I got into my own preparation I began to appreciate leaving the raw materials for me to combine.  That way I had it just the way I wanted it. There were also a side of fries, but aside from being hot and crisp, I don't recall the taste two days later. \n\nMy server was very friendly and efficient, and obviously well trained.  She appeared to offer more water or ask if I needed anything, and I knew she really meant it, as opposed to the monotone I often get when the job is just routine.  I tipped her well for her pleasant professionalism. \n\nThe meal was good. Everything fresh, quality ingredients.  While I would not rush back for another meal, I certainly will remember I enjoyed my lunch and not hesitate to return to the Broad Street Diner when in the area.\n\nJanuary 4, 2016 - Stopped in for a late night dessert, coffee and conversation.  All three played their part well in making an enjoyable evening.  The Rice Pudding was excellent.",

    "text": "Originals Pizza sits to the side of the Giant Shopping Center on West Trenton Avenue in Morrisville, Pa.  It is in a small commercial strip next to a Wells Fargo office and a Dominos Pizza.  It has been here for a long time and has settled into its space nicely.  Although long and narrow, the furnishings create the sense of sitting on picnic tables under a striped awning along the outside walls of the building.  Nice, if gitchy, touch. \n\nThe moustachioed men behind the counter look like brothers, but they assured me they were not.  They were both friendly and ready to serve.  As I came in after 7 pm on a midweek evening, the pizza offerings were not vast for a guy in need of only a slice.  That is always the risk taken late in the day of any pizza shop.  You never know how long the pies on display have been waiting for your attention.  Their \"Tomato Pie\" seemed to have the most energy as it sat there, so I asked for it to be reheated to \"well done\" for me.  \n\nIt was that.  When it arrived I could see that the heavy tomato pasty topping had been reawakened.  Picking it up gingerly, it held its point well with only the slightest quiver from the weight above.  The scorch marks on the chassis were well established from the oven.  That is what I wanted.  First bite revealed a thicker than expected crust that resisted my clenching incisors just enough to let me know it would not yield its secrets willingly.  Solid chew.  \n\nThe slice was more than enough for an evening snack.  Two slices would have been way too much.  The top sauce was thicker and saltier than I prefer, and the few chunks of garlic not enough to demand serious attention.  I overheard the chef say to a customer that this was \"Brooklyn Style\" Tomato Pie.  Not sure what he meant, as it surely wasn't the T.Pie created and made famous across the Delaware in Jersey.  There, the mozza goes on before the sauce, and the tomato mix is applied more sparingly to achieve balance in texture and taste between the two main food groups.  Originals had little or no cheese that I could discern, but just the overpowering sauce.  \n\nIt was okay for what it was, but not close to what I was accustomed to in a Tomato Pie.",

While George Washington may not have slept here, he certainly ate here - and that is amazing. Through the centuries The Brick has seen its share of historic moments, as well as its share of scandal.  It has prospered and suffered at the hands of various owners, some of whom took great pride in the establishment, while others did not.  \n\nIt went through such a change a few years ago, and the trail of reviews shows this plainly.  Through it all, the first floor bar and dining areas have retained their charm and well accented colonial airs.  For that alone, The Brick is worthy of Fandom.  The cuisine may not always keep pace with the aura of the old stone, brick and wood.  \n\nToday, I attended a special function for a community group honoring (and roasting) some of the more ancient sportspeople in town.  For the first time in the long history of the organization, the silver cup was engraved with the name of a woman.  Very happy to be part of the moment.  Buffet dinner was served before the award ceremony.  It was spread out in the bar room; a perfect setting.  Spring Mix Salad, Chicken Piccata, Penne Vodka, Roasted Potatoes sat waiting for our walk through.  The salad dressing was a pale yellow cheesy creamy Italian and the croutons from a box.  The Chicken was slightly above room temperature with the lemony gravy semi-solid on top.  The Roasted Potatoes somewhere between well done and dry.  The pasta was good, but also not hot enough.  It wasn't that the ingredients were lacking, but that the preparation and presentation were not quite right. \n\nIf not for the great camaraderie in a grand old room, the food would have been a near fail.  We were not there for the food, so to some extent I can overlook the issues.  I was happy to be there today, and it was very cool to be part of this small piece of history being made.  \n\nGo for the atmosphere, and perhaps a drink.  Go for a brunch when you can sit on the glassed-in porch and view downtown Newtown. Don't go for more, or risk disappointment.",

Sad for me, they were out of the former, and I would never consider the later, when I arrived shortly after 1:00 on Wednesday afternoon.  Still, there were other choices.\n\nI asked the women behind the counter in the rear of the store what was the best thing they made and was told that aside from the Chicken Salad and Breakfast Sandwiches, the Cheesesteak was high on the list.  They were cordial and chatty, so I ordered a Chicken Cheesesteak with Saut\u00e9ed Onions and Mushrooms while I continued to question them about the Store and menu.  One lady retreated to the back room where the grill was located to made my lunch, and the other told me that her father had worked there 40 years ago, and she was creating a family tradition. Cool. \n\nWhile waiting I took a stroll around the small shop that had been standing on this site for at least 80 years.  The front half shelves were mostly empty, except for an ATM machine and small groupings of soft drinks.  The rest of the space was sparsely inventories with cookies, chips, snacks and other lunch accessories.  It was all rather Spartan. The refrigeration unit had the best provisions with the meats and cheeses for lunch making. While I normally enjoy the historical/cultural ethos that permeates an old commercial building that has withstood the passage of time, I found myself in a more somber mood within this building.  I don't know what it was but I felt a pall that made the air feel heavy and brooding.  Perhaps, it was just my low blood sugar crying out for something to eat.  On reflection, I think that somehow the depression era around 1930 was trapped inside the building. \n\nOnly take out here, so I went back to my office to eat at my desk.  The Chicken Cheesesteak was presented in white wrapping paper only.  It was still warm, but no longer hot when I sat down 10 minutes later.  The Chicken, Onions and Mushrooms had been chopped and mixed well.  The roll was fresh, but had a soft exterior without any appreciable crustiness.  The overall taste was decent, but not really satisfying.  It was a bit too salty.  Given the nearby alternatives, I would not get it again.  \n\nWrightstown Country Store has seen better days.  If walls could talk, they would certainly have tales to tell about life in these parts in the first half of the 20th Century, when Route 413 was still only Route 113.  But, the story for the second decade of the 21st Century is that the walls need a fresh coat of paint, and more imagination in the kitchen if it is going to attract business and continue to operate prosperously. \n\nI will return soon for a breakfast sandwich and provide an update.  I want to see if the vibe is more upbeat in the morning. \n\nStay tuned.",

My favorite bagel joint for many years was gone. What was I going to do?\nI checked on Google and Yelp for a substitute for my addiction.

But, there is a reason for only 3 stars.  The bagels are 4 star (everything is relative), but the interaction with the owner is stiff and unwelcoming (1.5 stars).\n The coffee is so-so.  The help is very good, and compensate in part for their boss's personality, and the lack of physical comfort as I stand in a long line waiting my turn.  Even that has its benefits, as there are many nice people to talk with.\nCash or check only.",

The original six spinner lunch counter still sits in back for those who prefer taking a load off in the 60s, before returning to the teen years of the twenty first. \n\nThe menu offers BYO omelets, quesadillas and loaded french toast in equal measure, but it pays to keep it simple because each additional item has an upcharge that quickly runs over $10 for even a basic sounding plate. Clever, but not exactly consumer friendly. I chose the naked Frenchie with three slices of thick white bread, melted butter and table syrup. \n\nIt looked great with all the caramelized edges, but was a bit dry as the profile showed the egg mix had barely penetrated the wider bread and the middle remained uninvolved in the cooking process. It wasn't all bad, but could have been so much more.

Can't blame them for offering Afghani dishes (Kofta), Indian options (Samosas, Tikkas) and Central American snacks (Empanadas), in addition to the expected gyros and falafels in pita, but to say they fit into the geographic culture of the Mediterranean is inaccurate. \n\nStill, even lacking the grill and spit for real lamb/beef gyro preparation, they do a decent job with what they have.  My lamb gyro in pita was overflowing with meat, tomato, onion, cucumber, yogurt and tahini sauce inside their somewhat thick skinned pita. It wasn't wrapped properly inside the aluminum foil, and was impossible to eat handheld once the paper and foil were opened enough to permit a big bite, thus making the use of a fork mandatory. The lamb was in small chunks rather than being carved in slivers from the mother as it slowly spun vertically on a grill. I found it tasty and filling despite missing the traditional cooking method.\n\nNo one will mistake Aya Kitchen for the real deal in Mediterranean dining, but it wasn't bad overall for a mall food court. I would easily chose it again if I found myself hungry and alone in Oxford Valley Mall.",

    "text": "Victoria's Bagel Bistro is really more of a tie dye T-shirt, hippie dippy kind of place out on Rt. 38 in Mt. Laurel, NJ.  The place has a nice sized room with about a dozen tables, Rock & Roll Classic Hits for sound, and photos/sketches of Presley, Marley and a few other music heavyweights on the walls.  Definitely, a chill place.  \n\nVictoria, herself, served me.  Very friendly and accommodating owner that puts herself into the environment she created.  She gave me the two bit tour of what was available for breakfast, and I opted for an Onion Bagel with a smear of Butter and a few slices of Swiss, not toasted. I took a seat at the table nearest the front window, and settled down to check in on Yelp.  \n\nThe bagel arrived looking quite good.  There weren't a lot of toasted onion flakes on the surface, but enough to hold the flavor.  In profile, the transection was a nice layering of bread and cheese.  First bite announced that the surface of the bagel was not crisp, nor crunchy, but rather more like the regular crust of a bread loaf.  I really prefer a more distinct outer texture with a softer airy middle.  So, while the taste was decent, it was not an optimal bagel for me. We all have our own opinions about bagels, and this must be what the strong enthusiasts here like most.  For me, is was really only Okay.  \n\nStill, the java was hot and strong, the price very competitive, and the overall experience, positive.  I liked what Victoria was doing there. \n\nAnd, wish her continued success.",

    "text": "Stewart's is part of the small food court in Neshaminy Mall, Bensalem, PA. What it can't duplicate due to lack of being a stand alone drive up roadside dog, burger and root beer joint, it tries to make up for with friendly service and a menu straight from 1975. \n\nA hot dog lover, when the mood strikes and there aren't many local frankfurter havens nearby, even this neutered version of the iconic Stewart's Root Beer emporium, will do. Although there are a few better dog shops around (Cheese Dogs on Bustleton being an excellent alternative). I ordered their special with fries and black cherry beverage and a skinny beefer buried under chili, relish, onions, mustard and ketchup. It came in a plain white bread bun that had a hard time holding up under the damp weight of all the condiments.  Lucky I grabbed a handful of napkins. \n\nIt was okay, but the doggie was lost in all the flavors above. The texture came through, but not much of the taste. The fries were decent because freshly made, and the carbonated drink stronger in flavor than the original root beer. \n\nStewart's would do well to investigate the competition, especially the more creative houses like Tower Dogs and Destination Dogs, that produce a far superior product and gastronomic experience. They should up their game to capture a more discerning crowd, while holding on to their simpler pleasures as well.\n\n Why not appeal to everyone?",

    "text": "This International House of Pancakes on Mt. Holly Road, Burlington, NJ, sits in a renovated former fast food structure, and is small compared to the more recent versions of this franchise around the country. All the cues are there to prepare you for a hearty breakfast. \n\nI walked in before court last week for a light bite and coffee, and to kill some time before my workday began. I took a seat at the 5 stool counter and was served by Tim, a young dude who seemed diligent and engaging. After a short look at the long menu, I opted for their traditional french toast and strong java. All the other choices seemed like they would be way too sweet with berries and whipped cream. Didn't want those calories. \n\nMy plate arrived ten minutes later looking attractive and tempting. I spread the cup of butter across the egg pocked surface, and poured on the old fashioned syrup (maple not on the counter).  First bite was very good, but a realized that their signature approach to this dish was to add pancake mix to the beaten eggs.  This was visible in the unusual shine on the surface of the toast, as well as the distinct mild taste of buttermilk with each forkful. I had not tasted this before, but I enjoyed this take on a historic platter.  Nice for a change of pace, but not something I would specifically request, as I prefer the traditional approach to french toast. \n\nThe carafe of hot coffee in front of me is another thing they do well. They realize that coffee is an inexpensive way to appear generous. \n\nI have never been a IHOP regular, as I normally prefer a mom and pop shop to a chain or franchise for breakfast, or any meal. Still, I appreciate what they do, and their effort to find a new approach to their business. They even are doing burgers now. Haven't tried them, but they do look good on the menu.",

It is located on South Warren Street, the cobblestoned lane that manages to look good despite all the degradation around it. It is an Americanized Mexi house that does it's best to imitate Chipotle, with bowls, burritos or wraps made to order as you select the rice, beans, meat, salsa and drink of choice being constructed behind the counter. All this for around ten bucks.\n\nWe walked down last week. The room was empty, but for one table when we arrived at 1:00. The two women working the assembly line were friendly and knew their craft. I ordered a bowl with brown rice, red beans, shredded beef, corn salsa and cilantro. It felt hefty on the plastic tray. \n\nThe result was tasty and filling, but far from special. Then again, I don't frequent Chipotle for the same reason. I prefer the authentic version of Central American cuisine so prevalent and delicious around this capital city. Yet, for a downtown foodery it certainly carries it's weight and contributes some variety to the lunch scene in these parts.",

    "text": "Las Margaritas on 2nd Street Pike, Southampton, PA, isn't bad for a casa Mexicana that serves mainly an American audience not necessarily familiar with the deep choices available in a kitchen that caters to its own nationals. The space is large and dimly lit, with plenty of colorful cues of its South of the Border cultural heritage. It is very popular as witnessed by the long wait for people walking in looking for a table. Luckily, as a solo diner, I was able to grab a barstool and take my liquid and solid choices right there.\n\nI have been somewhat spoiled by the wide variety and authenticity of all the casas Latinas in and around Trenton, which has become a very ciudad Centro Americano. All those formerly Italian corner restaurants now speak Espanol, and they put out amazing cuisine. \n\nStill, Las Margaritas is a good place for a reasonably priced cocktail by the same name, and the well known dishes found in most Mexican houses catering to gringos. Lots to choose from in terms of nachos, tacos, burritos, chimis, and tortas, and even a few decent dinner platters, like the chili rellenos ordered by me.  I found the two large breaded and fried poblano peppers to be nicely loaded with melted cheese and queso fresco, and topped with a thin, but well spiced, ranchero sauce. I tossed on the salsa from the chips to add texture and heat, and enjoyed the refried beans and dirty rice accompaniments. \n\nNot a bad meal at all. Bartender service was fine and muy amable. The only hiccup was being tendered the wrong cuenta for a couple of bucks more than what I ordered. El hombre tried to tell me it was the same price as what I got, but I knew that was not the case. Still, it wasn't worth a challenge to his manhood, so I let it roll, and adjusted the tip accordingly. \n\nHonesty is always the best policy when it comes to restaurant tabs.",

    "text": "It seems that Caf\u00e9 con Leche has been in Newtown forever.  It is a place I used to go to with some frequency, but over the years it fell off my radar as a \"go to\" place for good Latin/Italian styled cuisine.  When a friend recommended it for lunch I jumped at the chance to revisit an old friend. \n\nDaniel Lucci is the owner/chef in this walkout basement of a restaurant on the Newtown Creek side of State Street.  It is best approached from the parking lot next to Isaac Newtown's, where it must compete for parking.  It is accurate to describe the dining area as small and dark, but for some that adds to the ambiance and charm.  The menu seemed smaller than I remembered it, but it still had Mexican, Italian, and Continental flourishes.  \n\nLunch was from the Sandwiches Menu.  All are prepared on French Bread with a side salad.  The bread is fresh with a moderately crunchy crusty ingratiating bite, and my accompanying salad was potato with celery and a mayo-mustard creamy connector.  The Yellow Fin Tuna Salad was good, layered with lettuce and tomato slices.  It was satisfying and filling.  The Cajun Salmon was nicely blackened with a Pesto Mayo dressing and side garden salad with Daniel's special Balsamic Vinegrette, he calls, \"Balsamico.\" I tasted this and thought it was better than the tuna.  \n\nI could not escape the thought that perhaps, Caf\u00e9 con Leche had remained too long in the same space, and thus cramped its growth in both tables and adventurous gourmet meals.  A little more sunshine might open this accomplished chef to brand new and exciting possibilities.  In some way it seemed that the rest of the local restaurant world had caught up to CCL, and even passed it by.",

To be honest, had this meal been at the same level as lunch, I would have lowered the ranking down to 2 Stars. \n\nBut, it wasn't the same.  The Sausage, Egg and Cheese sandwich was a totally different animal.  It was loaded and it exploded.  Where the run of the mill sandwich has one sausage patty, this one had two.  When most put in a single sunny side up egg on top, WCS cooked up two flat omelet style huevos and wrapped the sausage within it.  Most will not cut the sandwich before packing it up to go, but these folks cut the Kaiser Roll before enclosing it in white paper with a heavy tape sealer.  The only weak link was the roll, which was fresh, but lifeless.  \n\nThe first bite released the mix of meat and cheese flavors strongly.  The textures worked well, especially the double patty which required more chewing, and thus more release of the undertones.  It was an imperfect pleasure to eat. \n\nI would certainly go back to the Store to pick up breakfast on occasion. If we were just talking about breakfast sandwiches, 4 Stars might be attainable, but given the condition of the facility and the sadness it evokes, and the less than satisfactory lunch sandwich, 3 Stars is where the ranking belongs.  \n\nBreakfast saved the bacon.",

If this isn't a gold mine just based on overflow from the S.$$$, I don't know what is.  \n\nFirst impressions walking through the front door is one of narrow aisles and stacks of used books and Cd's (also some tapes, etc), with hand written labels to direct you and creaky wooden floors that have been tread on for more than a century.  Yes, there is also a dustiness and slight scent of decaying paper, as would be expected where thousands of old books are stored.  It all adds to the overall gestalt of entering a literary and musical time warp.  It is quite enjoyable if you like this sort of thing.  I do.\n\nLikely due to the rent paid for this location, the prices on the books and music are higher than seems reasonable, and the trade in policy is not designed to provide value to the trader.  Over the years, I have purchased a few things here on impulse, but overall aside from wanting the old place to survive, the selection is generally not what I am looking for, and the cost offsets the cultural and historic imperatives. \n\nDefinitely worth a long browse while sipping caffeine from next door, but if you have visited the Princeton Record Exchange you know what a dedicated used music emporium is all about.  This one is not that.  As to the books, you might find something you like, but if you don't, the Newtown Library Company is about 2 blocks away.  You can join and likely find what you seek and be able to return it after reading. Recycling at its earliest and best.",

Still, it is a survivor, and puts out decent pies at reasonable prices, as long as you are willing to overlook the worn out feel of a now run down store.  \n\nI am about the pizza and can ignore almost anything when in the presence of good T Pie.

Much better than the paper plates used by so many joints. I did not mind going to the high counter to retrieve them. \n\nAlthough I seldom order a \"fancy\" slice, she asked for a chicken parm wedge.

Mine were sausage and traditional Trenton tomato pie. They had a firm thin crunchy crust that held up well. Not too oily. The gravy was a little salty, but nice and thick with clumps of Tomato on top of the mozza on the TP. They used sliced sausage rather than free form which exuded less flavor than preferred. \n\nThey weren't perfect, nor even exceptional, but still pretty good.

It has been run by one family since 1978, and they certainly know what they are doing adapting to changing tastes and fads to remain a solid choice for a hearty meal and a load of suds options. \n\nFirst impressions are that Fireside has three personalities - a front room dive bar full of locals enjoying the broad beer list and a few eating something meaty from the grill; a simple dining room with a dozen tables, and outside patio enclosed in canvas and plastic for cold weather, with a few picnic tables and service bar. The front bar was the most crowded  and with the most attitude.\n\nOur server told us to sit anywhere and came back to us quickly for drink orders. Menus were already on every table.  Two pages of beer options took a few, but we settled on Limbo IPA and Weyerbacher Imperial Pumpkin Ale drafts. Cool and smooth going down. \n\nSon opted for a pulled pork sandwich with chips. He liked it, but has had better flavor. Too, there was no sauce on the table for added moisture and taste. The grilled salmon was a small steak, but fresh and nicely done. The spinach and slaw sides were forgettable.  My chicken & rib combo put a heavy plate with 6 ribs and quarter bird before me. They were both covered with the house BBQ sauce, a deep amber red.  The meat easily pulled from the bone and tasted of a good rub, long smoke and twangy sauce. Really liked it, and they were so loaded that I ate three, gave two away and brought one home along with the untouched clucker. The baked beanz were great and the mashed would have been too with a spoon of gravy or sauce on top. \n\nFireside is a solid choice for basic BBQ in a down home environment.  It's nothing fancy, just serious meat overload and strong fermentation possibilities. Put a few table rockets of Memphis, St.Louis, Carolina,  along with the house slather in front of me, bring the ribs out dry for me to doctor the way I want, polish up the sides a bit, and this smokehouse would be seeing stars.",

Plenty of windows and the sunlight was pleasantly warming.  \n\nThe overall impression is that it feels small inside, perhaps because of the dark wood and cut up design.  The bar has 9 or 10 stools on two levels, and the rest of the barroom seconds as the main dining area.  It feels somewhat rustic.  \n\nI ordered the Patty Melt, and it was quite good.

The rest of the menu seemed to offer plenty of comfort food that would be worth a try.  \n\nI remember when this was the Wycombe Inn back in the day.

    "text": "As circumstances would have it, a single visit to a nearby Home Depot in West Windsor, NJ, has become a series of trips to three (possibly four) of their warehouse distribution stores in and around Mercer and Bucks Counties, NJ and PA.  I picked up a bag of black mulch while buying sand last week just to see how it would look in the flowerbeds and under trees.  At $3 per large 50 pound bag, it was worth the investment.  Turned out that the quality and coverage was very good, so I went to the location nearest where we were having dinner the other night, and purchased six more bags.  \n\nCan't have enough of a good thing, so I stopped in to the HD on Oxford Valley Road in Langhorne, PA, last night to haul away eight more sacks of the black moist blanket to spread this weekend.  What is obvious is that I'm not the only one getting this stuff, because the pile of bags in their nursery was depleted when I arrived last night.  Plenty of brown and red available, but the black was almost exhausted.  Too, I realized that if I am to attempt all my garden beds, I am going to need a lot more mulch!  The fifteen already stacked around my beds will likely double or triple before I am done. \n\nSo, while checking out, I inquired of the gardening lady cashier whether more would be brought out.  She assured me they had many more pallets where that came from, which would be moved into place before the store opened today.  Further, taking pity on my dirty work in lifting, stacking, hand trucking and car loading while in my suit, she informed me that they had people around who could do all that for me, and all I had to do was drive up and open the back gate of the wagon.  \n\nNice to know I won't have to include a dry cleaning bill in the expense of freshening up my garden. Too late for these slacks, but I can deal with that.\n\nPS. I'm now at 25 bags and no where near done. Luckily, they started a sale @ $2 per bag! I'm going to need a bigger truck!",

    "text": "It is hard to believe that prior to 1926 there were no bridges across the Delaware River south of Trenton, NJ. Despite the growing American love affair with the automobile, the only way to get across that body of water anywhere near Philadelphia was to swim or take one of the two ferries that operated from bank to bank at Camden and Burlington. There wasn't a car ferry until 1922, when a private business started a service that was wildly successful, but not nearly capable of meeting the growing demand. \n\nSo, the same entrepreneurs seeing the success of the new Benjamin Franklin Bridge just to the south that opened in 1926 as the longest suspension bridge in the world, organized their consortium to construct a span between Palmyra, NJ and the Tacony river ward in Philadelphia. Eighteen months and $4 million later, they had their toll bridge open for business. Rudolph Modjeski, the designer of the Ben Franklin and Manhattan Bridge in New York, did the work. \n\nThe first year the average volume was 3,500 cars per day. These days it is over 70,000. The original $.35 toll has gone up to match inflation and is now four bucks. Keeping things local, the steel components were fabricated by the American Bridge Company of Trenton, NJ, an offshoot of the older Roebling Steel Works, where the Brooklyn Bridge was cast. \n\nThis isn't a particularly efficient bridge these days, as it remains a drawbridge that raises up to allow ships to pass beneath, causing traffic to stop for 20 minutes with each opening. Too, the access on the Philly side it a problem as it has not been redesigned in nearly 100 years, except for modest improvement recently. Of course, it still is useful if your reliance on the trolley service hasn't changed since your great grandparents used them. \n\nOtherwise, better to plan for the nearby Betsy Ross or Ben Franklin, both of which are easier to use than the venerable but outdated TPB.",

    "text": "I'm not sure what to make of the fact that there were no Indians in the kitchen of Cross Culture Indian Restaurant in Buckingham, PA. The menu was more limited than many I've seen, and the dishes themselves while decent, lacked some of the dynamism I associate with quality curry and other colorfully spiced South Asian cuisine.\n\nWe ordered their Veggie Samosa and Tomato Soup appetizers, Chicken Cashmere, Veggie Navaratan Korma as entrees and Garlic Naan for sopping up the anticipated creamy reductions. They were a mixed bag. \n\nThe Tomato Soup was disappointingly bland, and we decided to bring it all home to doctor it to a better place. The Samosas had a good crunchy shell, but the potato/pea contents was dry with little tongue tickle. The Cashmere was the best of the bunch - pleasantly creamy sauce sweetened by the cashew and raisins and tender dark chicken. The Korma was also quite good, but the sauce was too similar to the Cashmere and needed a bit more curry heat to make it distinguishable from its sibling. Where was the tumeric and chili? Finally, the Naan was hot and oily as it should be, and quickly gone as we enjoyed spooning up the sauces as our dessert. \n\nService was warm and efficient by one of the owners. She seemed to appreciate our presence in the days before restaurants were closed to protect from the COVID-19 crisis. We all suspected that moment to arrive soon, so in some ways we expected and acknowledged that this might well be our last meal out for the foreseeable future. Just wish the entire meal was as memorable as the societal moment we all were enduring. \n\nBe safe everyone.",

    "text": "I have a love/hate relationship with Wawa. It applies more or less equally to all of them, but especially the super hyper Wawas that are currently being developed on the East Coast. \n\nI certainly see the value buying their gasoline which is always a few cents cheaper than the regular gas stations in the area. Yet, I hesitate to buy it because I don't know who refines it for them, and thus can't trust its quality and ingredients. Too, I will sometimes stop in for coffee or a hoagie, but know that by doing so I am helping weaken the older mom and pop shops that rely on passing drivers for their survival. So, I usually feel conflicted visiting these 21st Century phenomena and avoid them more often than not.\n\nIt's not about whether they present a real monetary value to customers, nor offer the convenience of being able to fill up both your tank and stomach in the same place. Obviously, there are benefits in time and money being able to do so. But, do we want this to become normative behavior if the cost is really enforced conformity, universal standardization of our diets, and the end of all the variety that existed earlier in our cultural evolution? \n\nI have concerns about this piece of progress, and wonder (perhaps, too often outloud) whether we would be better off if we spent more time doing little things like buying gas or eating lunch. Ultimately, I have no problem if I end up at a charging station to power my vehicle rather than slaving to the internal combustion engine, because that's good for the environment. But, on actions where convenience and not ecology is as stake, I vote for a little less time saving, and much more consideration of the existential quality of our lives. \n\nIt may not be fair to make Wawa the symbol of that degradation, rather than just another symptom of something bigger, but I came to that realization naturally, and it seems to capture my internal conflict as well as anything else. \n\nFeel free to ignore these rantings of a peaceful lunatic, but sometimes you just have to ask the questions.",

    "text": "Nino's Trattoria & Pizzeria sits just off the Brunswick Circle in Trenton, NJ.  It is easy to see how it is a pizzeria, but it does not look nor feel like a trattoria. Rather, there is a long narrow area to the left of the restaurant with the ovens and prep zone, and a larger dining room to the left as you enter.  There are a dozen or so tables and booths in this typical Italian shop.  It would look a lot nicer if the chairs had been taken down off the tables during business hours. It felt like they weren't quite ready for prime time. \n\nHowever, my lunch was of considerably higher quality than the atmosphere.  My eggplant parm sandwich was made of thin sliced nightshade, dipped in breadcrumbs, and pan fried in olive oil before being placed in a submarine roll, topped with red sauce and slices of mozza cheese and thrown in the oven to melt the cheese and toast the bread.  The coating was thin enough to allow the flavor of the veggie to come through loud and clear.  Not too much gravy nor cheese to obscure the main ingredient, but enough to enhance it.  \n\nMy companion went with penne with their house red gravy, in a child size portion. Just right for lunch.  I sampled the pencil points and found their sauce to be very good.  It had lots of minced garlic, salt, pepper and a touch of basil; creating a lightly chunky tasty crushed tomato texture and rich taste.  Although I usually eat the eggplant without the roll, I found myself sopping up the delicious mash with pieces of the hoagie roll, it was so good. When I asked for the second half of the sandwich to be packed up for home, the server put in two extra small containers of the sauce, because she had seen me going after it with gusto at the table. Gratitude! \n\nNino's has some strong kitchen skills with their pasta and baked specialties. Can't speak to their pizza.  A little attention to the impression created in their customers would allow them to make the dining room more presentable, and create the sense of a polished dining facility.",

It is richly appointed with dark mahogany and fabrics, tables & chairs, and soft gold and amber tones. The male staff is in shirts and ties. The entire ambiance is of an upscale restaurant, with a menu that generally covers the broad range of Chinese cuisine and a more limited Japanese list of sushi, and popular offerings. Ownership is Chinese and I was there for a lunch of their American/Chinese dishes. Expectedly, prices were also significantly higher for their afternoon specials, which came with cups of soup and white rice. \n\nIt was Friday after court in Norristown, so I didn't mind spending more to send me serenely into the weekend. I opted for their Orange Beef and Wonton Soup @ $11. \n\nThe soup was excellent. Fresh, flavorful consomme with two goldfish wontons and small slices of scallion for extra taste. Enjoyed every hot steaming slurp. The beef platter was not as good. Rather than using lean beef textured to hold a crisp finish out of the wok, they appeared to use a different cut of beef more akin to beef for stew or roast. It was stringy on the inside and far more chewy than it should have been. With mastication pieces of each morsel became lodged in my teeth; not a pleasant sensation. The sauce was well designed, and mildly tart, which helped convince me that completing the meal was worthwhile, although a floss challenge thereafter. \n\nGiven that a much better version of this dish costs $2.50 less at my local dragon den, I see no point to spending more for lesser satisfaction, nor to exploring more of the menu when I have seen they don't handle the basics any better than less pretentious kitchens.",

The Chicken itself was plentiful with a mix of white and dark meat, breaded, and drowned in dark amber goopy sauce, with sesame seeds sprinkled on top.  It was not bad, but undistinguishable from most other such joints.  The rice had been prepared in the same soup mix as the wonton, and carried the same yellow color.

There are Sushi, Thai and Chinese options on the menu.  I went Chinese for my first visit as I knew it was owned/operated by Fujianese folks from the Mainland. \n\nI opted for Szechuan Chicken (extra spicy), which came with Wonton Soup and Pork Fried Rice.  The soup was not good.  It was a mass produced beef stock tinted brown from the dye in the can it came from.  The wontons were thick and not very tasty.  The Chicken dish was better.  The meat was fresh and the veggies colorful.  The sauce lacked much in the way of red Szechuan chilies, and was not hot enough despite asking for extra heat.  I think the kitchen was on autopilot and just turned out what they normally do and ignored my request.  At least it was decent, even lacking the spice.  The Fried Rice was better than average with the grains still distinct and veggies firm.  \n\n The best thing Asian House has going for it is Misty, the woman running the front of the house.

A semi-private dining room was off to the side.  Service is warm and precise, and the menu offers a fairly broad cross section of dishes from Vietnam and Thailand.  In such \"fusion\" locales, the question always is whether it is really \"fusion,\" or more confusion?  \n\nThe staff we saw was Thai, and we took that as a suggestion to stay close to the menu from their homeland, just to be safe.  Besides, we have been to many very good Vietnamese shops in and around Philly, and our Thai options were always more limited.  \n\nWe ordered Coconut Soup (w/ Tofu), Summer Rolls (Veggie), and Salmon in Red Curry Sauce for sharing.  The soup had the sweetness from the coconut and the hot bite of lemongrass, with plenty of veggies.  It was quite good, and was slurped away quickly.  The summer rolls were also top notch, with a thin strip of tofu holding the rest of the contents together.  The peanut dipping sauce was excellent with thin chili shavings and ground nuts sitting on top, looking like calligraphy (see photo).  If there was anything that missed the mark, it was the salmon, which was slightly overcooked, and was drier than desired.  Still, the presentation was lovely, and the surrounding elements on the plate along with the red curry, redeemed the fish to some extent.  \n\nWe were enjoying our time here, and decided to extend it with a fried banana dessert.  It came in the guise of spring rolls with a large scoop of Bassett's Vanilla Ice Cream melting on top.  It was a creamy sweet ending to our evening at Viet Thai.  \n\n3.5 Stars",

The bad news is that Indian Hut is still the equivalent of a fast casual food outlet - better than fast food, but far short of haute subcontinental cuisine. So, unless your expectations are properly calibrated, you are probably going to be somewhat disappointed by the size of each entree, the roughness of the main ingredients, or the non-subtlety of the various sauces into which everything is thrown and mixed. \n\nOur Malai Kofta (veggie balls in mild red curry), Chicken Korma and Makhani (boneless chunky chicken in spicy red/lightly sweet mild yellow curry), Chili Gobhi (fried cauliflower florets in Manchurian red chili/tumeric heat) and Veggie Biryani (long grain basmati rice mixed with chopped greens, like fried rice, but not as captivating), were strong on spice, pretty in color, but perhaps too monotonal in texture and heavy handed Indian spices. \n\nNot that everything was bad, it wasn't. It's more that everything was too much alike, so that the dishes blended together indistinguishably from each other after a few bites. \n\nAt $11-12 per choice, it wasn't too expensive, but would have been so much better with a deft curry hand at the controls. Then again, if you can taste the difference between fast casual and superior tasting North or South Indian kitchens, you don't really belong at such inferior joints.",

When I asked one of the guys behind the counter how many pies they do a day, I was told anywhere from 50 to 300! Quite a range, but they were getting ready for the high end when we were there by cutting up the dough and placing them in small aluminum canisters. \n\nThe house itself has two dining rooms and can accommodate quite a crowd. It is clean, and service is prompt and friendly. We ordered a single plain slice to see how they do with their most basic commodity, an eggplant parmesan sandwich and a burger with onions and mushrooms.  Nothing stood out as exceptional, and some things need work. \n\nThe plain pizza is average in size and taste. Mine was a reheat job, well done. They got that right, and the crust was nice and firm with a mild scorch on the undercarriage. There was too much cheese for me, and not enough sauce. Really could not get the flavor of the tomatoes due to cheesy dominance. Pizza requires the right balance on top to make it stand out. This did not do it. The eggplant parm sandwich was in a large torpedo roll, again covered in copious melted mozzarella. The nightshade itself had a heavy breading that absorbed a lot of oil in the frying.  Would have been better if just saut\u00e9ed in olive oil without the extra breading, but was still okay. The burger was disappointing. A frozen puck, cooked to well done when medium was requested. Dry and tasteless, despite the additional saut\u00e9ed onions and mushrooms. Even the ketchup couldn't save it. \n\nThis was a late lunch, and we didn't explore the dinner and pasta options, which may be as good as the other reviewers report. Still, I can only write about my experience, which was not quite middle of the road.\n\n2.5 Stars.",

I stopped in after court this week to check them out for a morning bite and mugga joltin' joe. \n\nTheir menu has a lot of \"Build Your Own\" dishes from omelets to pancakes, meat, tater tots and quesadillas. That approach gets pricey and belly stuffed quickly, so I opted for an order of French Toast neat - with just melted butter and syrup. I drank their java and read the news while waiting for delivery to my table.\n\nIt was pretty good. Thick cut slices, well caramelized with decent mix of sugar and cinnamon in the eggs. The only shortcoming was that the egg hadn't penetrated past the outer layer of the bread, and as a result the thickness of the loaf became a detriment, making for a semi dry morning meal that required a copious pour from the syrup squeezem to keep it lubricated for consumption.  \n\nService was fine. No problems with accessibility as far as I could see, although I didn't visit the bathrooms. \n\nStill, I liked the joint and recognized its possibilities. It is a nice addition to downtown Mt. Holly and will certainly contribute to local commerce. It just need to soak the bread a bit more.",

    "text": "There are things to like about Brick House Tavern & Tap, and a few other things that detract from the overall experience. \n\nThe space is generally very nice, with an open floorplan, and brick wall along the back of the house. There are booths, high top large tables, sofas, and a bar - each offering a different comfort level. I was there as a solitary traveler, and chose to sit at the bar. This may have been a poor choice, as the design leaves a lot to be desired. \n\nAlthough square with barstools along each side, lines of sight are obstructed on each side by the beer tap hardware that extends down from the ceiling and spreads out it large apparatus just above eye level so it is impossible to see the HDTVs behind the bar. Also, after a pour (I had a Summer Shandy), the individual tap continues to drip onto the metal splash guard above the drain, spraying droplets of beer in all directions - especially toward me, the customer. While it didn't make me wet, it did reach the wooden bar top, making it damp and causing damage to the finish. There must be a better, cleaner, more sanitary way to deal with drippy taps. \n\nThe bar ladies were clearly selected for their fit in jeans, more than their tending skills. While I am not complaining about the view, the dropped and broken glasses, cut fingers, and spillage was not the most fun to observe. And, it happened twice during my hour there. \n\nThe Brick House Cheeseburger seemed a safe bet.  It looked good on arrival. Yet, the medium grill requested was much closer to well done. The fries were fine. It was an average burger, at best. \n\nThe overall sense of this joint is that management does not run a tight ship, and should spend more time training staff to be sure the customer is the center of attention, rather than the interaction between the workers. The menu is pricy for this level of roadhouse experience, and the quality of the menu and service should reflect that. Otherwise, what you get is a dive bar trying to pass itself off as elite.",

    "text": "This Rancocas Woods section of Mount Laurel, NJ, has a out of Jersey feel to it.  Semi-pine barrens, small cabin stores along every rural byway, and an almost eerie 19th Century feel.  So, when I found myself on these back roads looking for a way back to the present, and came across an old roadside stand with a small parking area and a sign that said, \"coffee and breakfast,\" I was curious enough to stop and check it out.  \n\nInside I found a 1950's shop, with a couple of tables up front, and a counter and grill in the far corner.  There was a woman in back putting together a large lunch order, and a younger guy working the hotspot.  He turned, smiled, and asked how he could be of assistance.  He recommended a breakfast sandwich by reputation.  I was down with that, and ordered a sausage, egg & cheese on Kaiser roll, with coffee, for immediate consumption.  I grabbed a take out menu and a seat at the table closest to the door.  Couldn't find them on Yelp, and decided to put them into the system.  He didn't mind.  \n\nMaybe it was all the surrounding country that played with my head, or just the quality of the air inside this old wooden structure, but there was a definite drift pulling me backward in time.  Kind of pleasant, and not strong enough to stop me from returning to today.  When the sandwich arrived on a green plastic plate covered in sandwich paper, I had been looking out the window at an old pickup parked under BJ's rusted and distended sign creaking in the breeze.   \n\nThe aroma brought me out of reveries, and back to the quiet hunger in my pit.  It looked good; all steamy and melty.  Single sausage patty, two slices, and a nice egg scramble.  Tasted good, too., although their bakery provider could make crustier rolls. This one was soft and had the taste of white bread in roll form. The Joe was hot medium roast.  Only one size for coffee.  Fill it up as much as I liked, according to the chef/manager.  So, I did, about half way. \n\nNot sure I will find myself in this neighborhood again, because I'm not exactly sure how I got there.  But, if I am, I will certainly stop in for one of their burgers or cheesesteaks, for which they won an award according to www.cheesesteaks.com. \n\nDidn't realize they had internet back then.",

    "text": "White Elephant Thai Restaurant has served Huntington Valley, PA, for many years from it's location in a commercial center strip. Their menu is elaborate with separate lunch listings between 11:30 and 2:00. I was there to partake of midday meal and was greeted warmly by the gentleman who served me. \n\nThe room is attractively appointed with elephant totems and warm curry tangerine colors. I was seated at a table behind the jungle growth of tropical plants separating the waiting/seating areas. On a long term addictive run with Thai broad noodles and elaborate sauces, I ordered their $10.95 lunch of Coconut Soup, Fried Thai Dumplings and Drunken Noodles with Chicken, 'Thai spicy.' \n\nThe house began to fill as the hour approached 12, and more help appeared from the back. The soup arrived first in small cup. The lovely aroma of coconut smiled seductively. It was excellent, with a few slices of tender chicken, carrot, onion. It was semi sweet and steaming hot. Suspicious beginning. \n\nThe dumplings were round with ground pork and spicy dipping sauce. They were plump and quite tasty as well. Two for two! \n\nLast came the noodles, and unfortunately, the letdown. Plentiful on the large plate, they appeared to have been sitting out too long after wokking, because the top was dry while the bottom of the dish showed sauce. Too, the chicken slices were extremely dry and dessicated. Likely yesterday's bird, reanimated. Disappointing, to say the least. Given that the chicken in the soup was right, the comparison was inevitable and suggested lack of concern.\n\nA budding five star experience descended to three and a customer lost. \n\nSometimes the last impression is more powerful than the first.",

The DD is across the parking fields from the hotel. \n\nThere are two Dunkins within a couple of miles of each other. There is one on Swamp Road in Newtown, and this one just off 95 in Lower Makefield.  I prefer this one because the coffee just tastes better.  How is that possible?  It all comes down to the quality of the water going in if it is not being strongly filtered before it touches bean. Two different water companies service each shop.  Newtown's water is hard and does not play well with coffee.  The Lower Make water is softer, and is a better companion in the brew. Thus, the taste in Newtown tends toward bitterness, while the L.Make drink is smoother going down. \n\nThe donuts are about the same for each, with perhaps a slight edge to Ntown for available variety. Sandwiches and B and R ice cream seem identical. \n\nSo, given the choice, I go to this place. Secondarily, it is also larger, and friendlier than its sibling. \n\nLying just over the border with Ntown, this is the place the Newtown Zealots meet to plot their next move. \n\nAlso, the best place to caffeine-up before starting a long drive north or south.",

A bit sketchy, but plenty of street life with cafes, food stores, fruit mongers, and a lot of action down in the park at 6th and Wolf. \n\nI Heart Cambodia has been in operation since December last.  It is bright and cheery, if a bit noisy due to constant drone of homegrown music videos and poor acoustics.  The folks operating the joint are friendly and amenable to longer discussions about their plans (a bar) and their kitchen (broadening the menu).  As a first timer, I had more than the usual questions about ingredients and spiciness.\n\nWhen it was time to order we found out there were no Summer Rolls available.  Small disappointment. But, we moved on to select Papaya Salad, Stir Fried Flat Rice Noodles with Chicken, and Prahok Ktis (the \"s\" is silent).  They were all okay, but nothing was exceptional.  The Papaya Salad was spiced by something that tasted like radish.  It didn't work for us, especially compared to similar dishes in Thai houses. Even allowing for cultural differences, it just wasn't a pleasant flavor.  The Stir Fried Noodles was the best dish; well prepared, but still not as good as others I have had in Philly and in Asia. The sauce for the Prahok Ktis was tasty with a mix of Pork, Coconut Milk, Lemongrass, Kaffir, Fermented Fish Sauce and Peanuts, but the slices veggies to be used as scoops were very small, making it awkward to use as intended. Everything was fresh, but perhaps measured for smaller fingers.  \n\nIt became clear looking around the room that the most exciting dish was the Ginger Fried Fish.  It looked great.  Next time that is where we start. \n\nI would also skip the Thai Iced Tea and the extra bowls of rice as unnecessary for the meal at hand.",

    "text": "Pho Palace is a bit of a misnomer.  \n\nThe facility is minimalist in d\u00e9cor, and a bit dreary in furniture and lighting.  Hardly a palace.  Still, there is a reasonable trade off to be made if your goal is good Pho, Banh Mi, Com or Bun dishes.  There are Thai and Chinese offerings on the menu, but I have not gone there even though management and staff appears to be primarily Chinese.  \n\nI ordered Banh Mi Thit Nuong (BBQ Pork Hoagie) and Pho Ga (Chicken Pho).  The Banh Mi was delivered on an oval plate over a strip of aluminum foil.  The torpedo roll was more Italian than French, with a thinner crust than a baguette, but toasted well.  The makings filled the bread with a nice quantity of tasty BBQ Pork, Daikon Radish, Cilantro, Carrots and Cucumber.  The mix crunched well and was quite satisfying.  My server assured me that the Banh Mi and a Medium Pho would not be too much for a meal.  He was right.  The sandwich was somewhat filling, but not so large as to be sufficient in and of itself.  I liked it and would definitely order it again.  \n\nThe Pho bowl was large enough to hold what seemed to be a liter of clear, well developed broth, loads of Chicken Slices, Onions, Scallions and a nest of Noodles. I spent a minute lifting and separating the clumped Noodles. After throwing in Bean Sprouts, Basil Leaves, Jalapenos, and Squeezed Lime Wedges, the bowl was overflowing and the aroma rich and comforting.  I loaded the side sauce dish with a Hoisin/Sriracha mix to dip the chicken, and settled in for a slurpy meal.  \n\nEverything was pretty good, and the service was friendly and efficient.  \n\nAdequate parking in front. Cash only with in house ATM.\n\nSo, how does this compare to the nearest other Vietnamese restaurant, House of Pho in Southampton?  I find them both good, perhaps appealing to different customers.  Where House of Pho offers a much nicer environment, Pho Palace is more basic and less comfortable.  The Banh Mi is House of Pho is higher quality; using real French Baguette, and more Pork.  The Pho in both locales are very close in quality and freshness of accessories.  To my palate, they are a draw.  Where Pho Palace has a distinct advantage is price.  The Banh Mi was only $3.75 - a (pardon me, I can't resist) PHOnominal price.  The Pho at $6.75/7.75 (Med/Lrg) is also lower than at the House.  \n\nSo, it comes down to what you need and want.  For a date or lux feel, House of Pho is the obvious choice.  You pay for it, but it may be worth it.  If only needing a solid tasty soup and sandwich, etc.,  without much environment, but saving a few bucks per person, Pho Palace is a very good alternative.  No doubt the rent each pays and the neighborhoods, have a lot to do with the prices on the menus.   Only separated by a few miles, the differences between Southampton and the Far Northeast Philly are considerable.  If I had to chose, House of Pho would be my first choice based on the overall experience from facility through food and ability to use credit cards.",

I guess their hoagies were just not that impressive to garner my loyalty. \n\nWith the arrival of Primos in the Village of Newtown Shopping Center, my interest in torpedo sandwiches has been rekindled, and after visiting another shop in the Slack's strip mall, I went in on impulse and ordered a Chicken Salad Hoagie with Provolone. The first thing I noticed was that they now offered their hoagies with a sesame seed roll option, just like Primos.  Who said competition doesn't improve all competitors? \n\nThe sandwich with hots and sweets was very good. About the equivalent of Primos, with a similar price.  If anything detracts from the Slack's experience it is that their facility has not changed in years and looks a bit dingy and dated. Also, the employees seem to lack the customer service polish of Primos.  These are not big things, but if the food is basically equivalent, then the decision comes down to atmosphere and price. Price is close. So, atmosphere carries the day, and Slack's is not on the same level as Primos. \n\nI will stop in now and then to see if things are changing, but it will not win me over until it sees the need to offer a new image, and takes steps to meet it.",

The meal was served in styro packaging with a mini fork for consumption.  The taste was fine.  \n\nIt always seems strange when a Chinese place doesn't have hot tea for guests.  Can of soda or water bottle are part of the meal deal, but how nice it would be if they provided a 2 cent tea bag and a small pot of hot water!  Alas, it is seen as unnecessary because so few Americans drink tea in these circumstances.  \n\nHo Choi did nothing to distinguish itself, but neither did it suck.",

It was fine, but the egg seemed to have been cooked in a microwave, which I do not prefer as it changes the consistency of the egg into something soft and airy, as opposed to how an egg is prepared in a fry pan giving it more substance.  I should have asked about that before ordering.  \n\nAll in all, an adequate meal, but not one I will yearn to repeat.

One glance at the full wall menu lets you know that you can spend your entire lunch hour reading the list and run out of time to eat anything. The list is that daunting. \n\nOnce getting past the Rosetta Stone wall by selecting the first thing I liked, rather than trying to absorb it all, and ordering an Italian Hot Dog at the counter, I looked around the rest of the room. There were tables and booths spread around, and on the opposite wall, the house slogan in large colorful letters, \"Now That's A Sandwich!\" \n\nWhich begs the question; is it? \n\nThey called my name when lunch was ready, and I went back to the counter separating the dining room from the kitchen, to pick it up. First impression was eye opening. A foot long torpedo roll spread open to hold a foot long frankfurter, split and grilled, on top of crisp fries and under a load of fried onions and peppers, and finished with heavy squiggles of yellow mustard. The shock effect was tremendous. I realized there was no way to squeeze all that together and fit it in my mouth. I found the basket with cheap plastic forks and knives, grabbed them and went to work. \n\nThe dog, onions, peppers and potatoes were very good. Garlic was the primary note of the dog, and the accompaniment went great together. I was proud to eat it all. But, I did leave the entire roll behind. It was in part strategic in that I could not consume all that bread. It was part choice. The loaf just wasn't worth the calories due to lack of flavor, absence of real crust, and a doughy, dense, dry texture without taste overall.\n\nAt nearly $11 for the sandwich and cold drink, it would have been consistent with real value to have a quality bakery provide a roll equivalent to its impressive  passengers. \n\nThus, \"Now that's almost a (great) sandwich,\" is the answer.",

    "text": "Good Mood Restaurant sits in the back of the large commercial center on North Olden Avenue, Ewing, New Jersey.  Although there is a very large parking area around it, the proximity of a Planet Fitness and nursing school in session, makes finding a spot somewhat problematic on school days.  Still, after cruising for a few minutes, something opened up fairly nearby.  \n\nGood Mood has been open since February.  It has a fairly large footprint, with plenty of tables for a large crowd.  It only serves breakfast, brunch and lunch.  Service is friendly, and they do a brisk takeout trade. The menu is traditional American egg oriented dishes, with a nod to wraps and Mexican options, as well as burgers available at all times. The space is bright and clean, and when you order coffee, they give you a half full thermal pitcher with java, so you don't have to ask for refills.  Nice touch. \n\nMy breakfast wrap consisted of a large tortilla filled with scrambled eggs, green chili, chorizo sausage, onion and cheese.  It came with a large side of home fries that were crisp and tasty. The wrap was filling and satisfying, especially after a few drops of Tabasco were added.  Definitely enough to allow me to skip lunch today. Always a good thing. \n\nEverything about Good Mood is solid. For the price, a little more pepper and chorizo would have been a positive. Nonetheless, it is a strong addition to the locale where it can be hard to find a decent meal first thing in the morning. \n\nWish them luck.",

Holland Family Dental makes alot more sense in English, but perhaps the point is that it is the correct linguistics in other cultures. Or, it could just be a mistake. \n\nThis office is on the lower level of this professional office building, and difficult to see from parking lot level. Once inside, there is a small waiting area with 6 chairs, a reception area with 2 women managing the intake and insurance operation, and three examination/treatment rooms with three hygienists and one dentist. \n\nThe expected first visit paperwork took a long while, but once that was accomplished, the wait to see the dentist, have x-rays, be examined and have a cleaning was fairly prompt. It ended up being an almost two hour visit. \n\nStaff was efficient, friendly and explained the process well. They were patient with my questions, and made intelligent adjustments when I realized I did not have a necessary document. \n\nMy son seemed satisfied with his dental care. Hopefully, he won't need to return until next year's maintenance.",

    "text": "It is a testament to the American melting pot that bagels have become an American dish sold by people from the Middle East who have no cultural connection to the ethnic source. \n\nA & S Bagel sits in a nondescript commercial strip at the bottom of Galloway Road.  It is clean and bright, even if uninspired in its d\u00e9cor, with yellow walls and lights, and white booths along one side.  The workers/owners are friendly enough and know how to slice and spread efficiently.  They don't have the broadest selection of bagels, but they are made in the back of the shop and are certainly fresh.  \n\nMy Onion Bagel, Butter and Swiss was ordered and delivered to my table within 5 minutes.  This being a Boar's Head operation, the option on the cheese was eliminated in favor of only their own brand; always a disappointment as the taste and texture of the Swiss is not as good as Finlandia, Jarlesburg, or other Euro-based names.  \n\nThe only major issue with the bagel was that it lacked a crusty skin, and had a weak yeast taste.  It was more like sourdough loaf in the shape of a bagel, and not the authentic crunchy outside and airy inside that notes a proper bagel.  Still, it was quite big, and obviously satisfying to many.  I suggest a visit to Bagel Train in Yardley if they aspire to a closer approximation of the real McCoy.",

It was as remembered - cozy, slightly past its prime, with small bar and side dining room. Lots of old Formica tables and rolled stainless steel chairs. I took a stool at the bar and ordered a domestic light draft and the flounder dinner with pepper hash and baked potato. \n\nEverything was pretty much average. No surprises in the brew. The fish was probably frozen, nicely breaded and fried in oil clean enough to have no secondary taste. The potato was not of a baking variety and remained dry no matter how much butter was melted into it. I liked the pepper hash, which was basically a spicy slaw. I mixed the tartar and shrimp cocktail sauces together on the plate from the two table rockets given me by the friendly bartender. They made for decent dipping of the fillets. \n\nMaybe the sandwiches are the way to go at the Kettle, because the platter was twice the price, yet far less than double the value.",

    "text": "What a difference 18 months makes! \n\nReturning to Pho Palace with a group of 6 to introduce neighbors to Vietnamese cuisine, and have another run at the menu, there were several new things going on in the house that all were all nice improvements.  \n\nFirst, walking in, the redesigned dining room was striking.  A large wooden pergola dominated the new front room, standing over the majority of the tables that were now separated by half walls.  Nice structure and lots more privacy.  New smaller dining rooms in the back for parties.\n\nSecond, credit cards were now accepted for orders over $20.  This was a big convenience for most customers, allowing the avoidance of the ATM monster in the lobby.  They were even willing to split our checks and allow us to use separate credit cards.  Friendly and seamless transactions. \n\nThird, Service was more efficient and professional.  The mostly male staff was all in black, and  was attentive throughout the meal - refilling water glasses, removing plates, asking if we needed anything more.  All good flourishes from where the level of service was on last visit.  \n\nMost importantly, the food was still good, although the prices were up fractionally, no doubt to cover the cost of renovations.  The Pho was comforting and fun.  The Summer Rolls stuffed with Shrimp, Pork and fresh cabbage; and the Peanut Dipping Sauce cool and tasty. The Grilled Chicken and Pork Banh Mis were loaded with meat, Diakon Radish, Carrot in a crunchy Baguette-styled torpedo roll.  Everything was passed around with enthusiasm.  Even our neighbors who also ordered a Chinese dish to play it safe, were satisfied.  \n\nThe improvements at Pho Palace were well conceived and executed.  \n\nKudos!",

The house has been at this location for decades and has changed ownership at least once.  Of late, the neighborhood has taken on a distinct East European flavor, and Taste King certainly caters to it.  The night we were there a birthday party was in full swing with toasts and song in both Russian and English.  \n\nThe menu is what you would expect from experience in most other Chinese/American shops, with a few specials designed by the chef that still tend to be variations on the established theme.  Pick a protein and the desired flavor; surround with rice or noodles; add on wonton or hot & sour soup, and those broad fried noodles for dipping in duck sauce and/or hot mustard. Voila! Your platter appears ready to consume.  \n\nWe ordered lightly.  Hot & sour soup and chicken corn soup. Grandpa's chicken and a bowl of white rice.  We had just come from great foot massage down the road, and weren't overly hungry.  \n\nThe soups were good, but not exceptional.  The hot and sour should have been warmed up more. The taste was about right.  The chicken corn was better. Certainly hot enough, but the surface was covered with tiny bubbles suggesting some chemical process was at work under the surface.  The Grandpa Chicken was made up of large chunks of white meat bird, wokked and covered in a dark red amber glaze sauce that was mildly spicy and enjoyable to eat. Only downside was that the chicken needed cutting before eating, making use of chopsticks problematic.  We found a work around. \n\nService was spotty.  Our waiter was attentive at times, and AWOL at others.  He delivered the soup and chicken with style, and then dropped the silverware on the table when he brought us ice cream after we received the check.  Whaaat?\n\nThere are more authentic Chinese restaurants a few miles farther down Bustleton, which compare favorably to Taste King. Try them all and decide for yourself which is preferable.",

Although rebuilt and modernized in the fairly recent past, it is still an unpleasant place to visit even for five minutes. \n\nYet, I was surprised to find Pizza-Grill.com in the back of the station near the exit doors.  It actually has a caf\u00e9 feel to it, with a few tables and chairs (and umbrellas) for sitting while eating their grub. The food offerings were far more extensive than expected; with sandwiches, wraps, breakfasts and pizza all on the menu, and hours starting from 4 AM to midnight. Friday and Saturday they are full tilt for 24. \n\nIt's not that the pizza I sampled was great - it was fair, at best. Even after requesting a well done reheat, it was still heavy with cheese than was warmed at its core, but far from hot.  The taste was okay, but in this capital city of tomato pie, that is not really good enough. There is so much awesome pizza around these parts that mediocre is just mediocre.\n\nSo, what it is, is, a pleasant surprise for Trenton train station, but beyond that, not a place atop your \"Must Try\" list. Nice enough if hungry while waiting for a train. Otherwise, not really worth the trip.\n\nART NOTE - There are some beautiful ceramic tiles placed around the Center (see photos) and a few right next to Pizza-Grill.  Really like the work, and would purchase a few of the local scenes if I knew where to find them. In fact, even Pizza Grill has murals painted on the walls of the shop that show talent.",

Although claiming to be authentic Italiano cuisine, it is really more of a hybrid with modern Americano thrown in to keep things interesting. We showed up on Super Bowl Sunday evening, suspecting that the game might suck, and we should be prepared with Plan B - a meal we could enjoy without need of huge HDTVs on the walls that demanded to be watched. \n\nWell, we were half right. The game was not worth watching. The food was somewhat more entertaining, but definitely not Italiano robusto. We ordered the calamari and minestrone apps/sides, and entrees of chicken marsala and lasagna. There was a side salad in there somewhere, too. Have to say, that while everything was okay, none of it was kickass. \n\nThe calamari had an unusual breading that made it quite salty, despite the better than decent dipping sauce. No complaints about the soup, but the salad with house dressing, was, well, dull. Not worth finishing. My lasagna was middle of the road, with decent gravy, but the mozza and added Romano-grate were salty. There was not enough heft in the sauce, nor the pasta to give it any tasty substance. Finally, the marsala mushrooms were pretty good, but although we appreciated the large grilled chicken breast, it was not designed to be balanced with the sauce and mushrooms. The chicken was the dominant feature, rather than a melding with thin medallions, tender enough to mix perfectly with the marsala reduction. It was all about the chicken, not the dish. \n\nWe ate in the barroom. It was cozy and our server was a quality dude with excellent skills. I sort of felt sorry for him working beneath his rank at this not quite good enough and salty restaurant.",

I asked for a place to have a quick breakfast after fasting since midnight. She advised that Munchie's was popular with the staff because of a broad menu and reasonable prices. As she had just been expert in hitting an artery on the first attempt, I figured she'd be accurate on food choices as well. \n\nThis long/deep shop sits just off the southeast corner of 7th and Chestnut. Ordering is done at the counter, and delivered to the table. I really felt the need for coffee stronger than for sustenance, so I ordered a breakfast wrap and large java. I got to pour the joe myself at the coffee service table, and sipped while waiting for the food. The drink was decent industrial strength drip that lost its joy of living as it cooled. Became more bitter the longer it sat. The wrap of bacon, egg and cheese in wheat, was just okay.  The bacon was unrecognizable, and had a odd taste. Perhaps, it was beef or turkey bacon without designation. \n\nSo, while the grub served to abate my caffeine and hunger gnawings, it was not something I would return for. It was average at best, although the prices were about right for what was provided. There are far superior places in the neighborhood to bring mind, body and soul up to speed.",

Plenty of stools available and a friendly crowd. \n\nI selected Downeast Cider and their Jamison Patty Melt (medium), as the accompaniment to my entertainment. Service was prompt, efficient and friendly. I liked the tart apple taste of the hard cider, but $6.50 for a pint seemed hazardous to my health. One was enough at that price.\n\n Too, the burger, though large and the right finish, was not the most flavorful I've ever had, and it crumbled as it cooled. Needed knife and fork due to the slickness of the Russian dressing, gruyere and natural greasiness of the puck. It was slip 'n slide all the way from plate to mouth. The heavier gauge friction of real rye would have helped over the lighter loaf used. It was still okay, but could have been a contender with more faithfulness to the concept. For $13, more was reasonably expected. \n\nThese folks should consider a weekend happy hour slot to draw people in with lower prices, just like during the week. It wasn't crowded this Sunday mid afternoon, and a little marketing might do the trick. No one minds saving a few bucks, even on the weekend.",

Although there are a few other places along Washington selling the traditional sammy, including a bakery west of Broad with excellent baguettes, Tu's uses better ingredients, wraps the work tightly in faux newsprint, and presents it in a red plastic basket. The loaf is not quite French, but is plenty good enough with the roast pork I had. Each bite left crusty crumbs on the table.  \n\nMy bubble tea special was refreshing with large mango and coconut pieces swimming with tapioca balls that jammed the straw with every draw.

I love the Chinese version of salt & pepper cuisine found in the spicier houses, but these were not that.  Rather, the wings were thickly coated in breading that included a load of sodium chloride and black pepper.  They were overly deep fried to a dark brown, and as a result were encased in the breading rather than simply dressed in it.  Wouldn't order them again.  \n\nThe shop itself is small, with 4-5 tables along one wall, and very high counter separation between dining and work area.  Felt defensive, not utilitarian. \n\nTu's is a worthwhile stop for Banh Mi and a drink, but wouldn't venture far beyond that on their menu.",

Not my fave, but okay.  \n\nOverall, this Chili's was about average for the genre.  No big complaints about the grub and drinks, but nothing to get wild about. \n\nPRO TIP - Be careful choosing your table, as they are not aligned with the low hanging light fixtures.  So easy to stand up and klonk your head on the heavy glass.  I was warned by our comedic waiter, but still gave myself a klep en vant.",

It sits in the forlorn Tarnsfield Plaza, along with a few other lost souls and a store front law firm.  \n\nWalking in, I was pleasantly surprised by the d\u00e9cor.  It was dressed up as a country back porch with trellis and picnic sentimentality.  The women behind the counter were pleasant and prompt in their attention.  My order was quickly taken and prepared, and the price reflected the probable rent on the shop.  Cheap!\n\nMy Onion Bagel with Butter and Swiss was pretty good.  The rounder's crust could have been crisper, but the innards were light and airy as I prefer.  Given the precip outside, expecting a crunch might have been a pipedream. The coffee was decent, but not a premium bean.  \n\nI was comfortable sitting there, eating and reading the digital Washington Post.  It was quiet with only one other eat-in customer and a few take outs.  I will return on a dry day to sample their wares again, and if the crunch presents, I will have found a cool place to chill while I await an appearance before the bar.",

My server was friendly, courteous and prompt with the large red coffee mug, keeping it full throughout my meal.  \n\nThe Sausage, Egg & Cheese on Croissant was a special this morning, and included a side of Hash Browns for a price under $6.  I was pleased that my waitperson pointed that out to me when she heard I was heading in that direction.  \n\nThe sandwich was constructed with double Sausage Patties, American Cheese, and a nicely Fried Egg.  The Croissant was fresh, and had a pleasant sweetness with every bite.  It was very good.  Yet, the half plate of Home Fries were room temperature at best.  They were overcooked and dry.  Add cool temperature to that, and I found them inedible.  Not sure why the grill chef didn't know that those taters were left in the corner of the iron for too long.  Just as well, as I didn't need the extra calories turning into sugars.  \n\nThe coffee came from a Bunn Double Drip.  It was a good bean, and I enjoyed having a large, heavy mug to sip from, rather than a smaller vessel to be constantly refilled.  \n\nOverall, the environment was attractive and comfortable.  A little more attention to detail would certainly make Blue Fountain a more positively memorable experience.",

They are clean, friendly, and reasonably priced for what they offer, and tend to be better than many of the other franchised wing-a-do shops around. \n\nI was there to grab a chicken sandwich and order two dozen wings for home consumption by the boys. I ordered at the counter, and walked into the dining area to await my light lunch. It arrived in a plastic basket, open faced, with a lightly coated breading on a large breast. A squirt from the ketchup table rocket and I was in business. It was a tasty chew, and I was pleasantly surprised by the thin coat and clean taste. Old oil was not used, and it was prepared just in time for me. Even the roll held up well to my gnawing assault. \n\nI brought the Asian Zing and Suicide wings home, and sat with my guys as they attacked the flaming appendages. Average sized wings, but with decent distinctive sauces that pointed out their relative advantages. The Asian Zing were hot, but with a Thai sauce sweetness to offset the conflagration. Liked them a lot. The Suicide were less forgiving, and stung all the soft membranes of the mouth and lips. They were okay, although number one son seemed to be more enthusiastic about them. To each his own. \n\nBoth came with small containers of \"sour cream.\" It wasn't, but they did chill the burn a bit as meat was scraped from bone by our incisors. Word to the wise, have your own sour cream in the fridge for such occasions to avoid unnecessary burn and blister.",

We were looking for dessert choices and coffee after a decent last supper down the road in Buckingham. \n\nPeddlers Village in Lahaska is a cutesy tourist center just outside New Hope, but where New Hope has a real community integrated among the beauty of an historic but tourist centric riverside town, Peddlers Village is all ersatz artificiality that looks dated and pretty, but lacks a human heart. So, it is not surprising to see all the poor reviews interspersed with a few positive ones. \n\nIf you get there on or near a baking day when most of the inventory is still new and moist, you are going to be happy. If you pick things that are a bit older and approaching their invisible sell by date, you're out of luck. Your purchase will be dry and disappointing. Problem is you can't tell them apart. Management hasn't figured out how to (or decided not to) inform the public which is which. There is no \"Day Old\" shelf. \n\nOur experience appears to be somewhat typical. Their La Colombe java (a Philadelphia treasure) was hot and strong, although not at the peak of perfection at that hour, while the Lemon Cheesecake Cupcake we shared was pretty good, although plainly just a small cheesecake with a dollop of lemon buttercream swirled on top. It really stretched the meaning of \"cupcake.\" Had it been creamier/softer it would have been fully satisfying, but as it was with the right taste yet wrong texture, it was just okay. \n\nThere were many other choices possible in the substantial display cases, so another selection might have made us happier, but we'll never know because as it was, our experience was just mediocre.",

    "text": "This is not part if the Villa Rosa empire from Yardley PA, as it changed hands sometime in the past few years, although the name and design are the same. \n\nThere are two operations here sharing a common kitchen. On the right is a pizza parlor with booths and small tables doing a slice, sandwich and takeout business, while on the left is a more formal dining room with similar menu and more comfort. Service is easily bilingual, and muy amable. \n\nI stopped in for a light dinner and opted for the parlor side as I know I didn't want a full meal, nor the attendant cost of table service. An eggplant parmesan on torpedo roll would do nicely, thank you. And it did. Very thin sliced melanzone sauteed to a soft textured in an olive oiled pan and lowered into the valley of a cut roll, with mozza and red gravy on top, and a final melt down in the pizza oven. \n\nThe taste was right, but it would have been better if the cheese and sauce had been layered in with the eggplant. Without that, much of the middle was somewhat dry and monotonal, lacking the mix of tomato, garlic, salt and basil throughout to bring up the flavor. I tend to deconstruct these beauties and eat the contents with knife and fork to reduce carb intake. If the bread is exceptional, I will eat some of it as well. In this case I consumed half of it, meaning it was pretty good. \n\nBased on my experience, I think the chef knows the recipes and techniques, but may lack the savior faire to realize that the ingredients need to interact more.",

Strictly a slice, pie and steak joint. Management is friendly and clearly happy for your business. \n\nThe food is what you'd expect from a traditional northeastern Mexitalian pizza parlor. The pies are competently made and the cheesesteaks are loaded with chopped beef, cheese and whatever else you desire in terms of onions, peppers, mushrooms, etc. The roll is decent, too, but not particularly crispy. Prices are definitely on the low end of the scale, making for a good meal on a budget. My two slice lunch (mushroom and plain) were requested well done, and that was what I got. Firm points. Scorched undercarriage. Well remelted mozzarella. Quite solid with a sprinkle of crushed hot pepper. \n\nNot sure if Luigi is in the house anymore, but as a place to grab a couple of slices and a drink for lunch, this place is worthy of consideration.",

It has been around for a long time and the layout and d\u00e9cor show how restaurants were put together twenty years ago.  Two small dining rooms with kitchen in the rear.  Comfortable booths and pleasant aromas, but in need of a little refreshing.  \n\nService was fine for most of the meal, except when our lone server was put to work elsewhere in the shop, and couldn't get back to us often enough to see we were finished eating and waiting for a box for the remaining pizza and our check.  \n\nThe food is decent.  The Tomato Pie comes with just spicy tomato gravy and no cheese, unlike across the Delaware where the mozza is spread across the top of the chunky sauce.  The different style requires a much heavier hand ladling out the sauce to compensate for the lack of balancing cheese.  The result is a wet pie whose middle crust cannot hold the weight and moisture from above.  If a crisp cracker-like dough is your hope, you won't get that here.  Even picking up the slices caused runoff.  On the other hand, the half pepperoni showed generosity, as half the pie was covered in quarter-sized coins of nicely sliced p-roni.  \n\nThe Caesar Salad was nice, with plenty of Romaine, Onions, Crutons, Tomatoes, but the small plastic container of dressing would have been so much nicer had it been presented in a small dish with a spoon.  No real complaints beyond style points.  \n\nThe Chicken Cheesesteak/Fries combo was hefty, and devoured without complaint.  Fries were average.  \n\nGiovanni's is a nice family place with low cost menu.  Nothing stands out as exceptional, but everything we had was okay to pretty good.  It definitely has a place in the Italian restaurant continuum.",

Crossing through a parking lot I saw Artistic Pizza in front of me.  I thanked the great spirit that sent me in that direction, and went in.  \n\nThe shop is very small, but the ovens are surrounded with a large variety of pies, and the owner/chef who was in the middle of making a new creation as I approached to make a choice.  I asked him for a recommendation for a first timer who loved great pizza.  He smiled at the challenge to satisfy me, and said his favorite was the Arugula Pie with a bit of Balsamic Dressing replacing the tomato sauce.  It was there in front of him, and I accepted that was what I should have.  \n\nI sat on one of the few tables in the front of the parlor and took in the street sights and sounds.  Tubby Olive was having its Grand Opening right next door, and there was a celebration going on.  People were walking around with samples of vinegars and oils.  Cool.\n\nThe slice arrived shortly on a paper plate.  It was a nice size, and the Arugula was plentiful and looked fresh, even after baking.  I found it quite tasty, especially the Balsamic.  A few cherry tomatoes dotted the landscape.  The only slightly odd thing to report is that although the presentation was more a flatbread \"pizza\" than a traditional one, the crust was not quite baked to completion.  Rather than being a dry, snappy crust, the middle of the crust still had some dough that was not completely hard.  The taste was there, but the texture not quite right.  \n\nOther than that, the meal was satisfying at one slice and a SanPelegrino Blood Orange drink.  I will stop in and try again.  I think this place is on to something good, and another visit may discover it fully.  \n\nSometimes the Universe gets it totally right, and sometimes it is off a little.  Still, I accept what comes, and look for the deeper meaning. In this case, it's just to be sure the pizza stays in the oven long enough.",

    "text": "BREAKFAST @ TIFFANY (Diner on the Boulevard)\n\nHappy New Year (2022) Everyone!\n\nMy last Yelp of the old year was at this fine establishment in the Great Northeast, Philadelphia. It had been closed an extended period of time for renovations, and the effort appears to have been worthwhile. The facility has a new outer shell and the main dining hall is bright, attractively utilitarian and very clean. Staff from management to servers are courteous and helpful. The menu is a diner's long list of nearly infinite possibilities. \n\nBut, I was there for a New Year's Eve Day breakfast, and while prepared to be tempted, knew what I wanted - French Toast & crisp bacon. There is a long counter along the back wall, and when I arrived it was unoccupied. I sidled down to the third from last spinner, past the last booth, and found myself in the perfect Covidly socially distance spot. No one with ten feet of me. I ordered coffee and my Frenchie. and perused my phone for the latest news while I waited. These days that is always a risky thing to do and expect to keep a good mood, but old habits die hard. (Good riddance 2021!)\n\nSo, my plate was delivered with a warm smile. I beheld two slices of thickish bread well grilled and sided by four slices of heat curled bacon. Both good to the naked eye. First bites told the tale. \n\nAlthough described as \"Challah\" bread, the texture was more a yellowish thick slice with extra sugar baked in. It lacked the rougher consistency and swirl of true Challah. Okay. I'm being picky, but the mental image of the real deal had excited my tastebuds and I was a little disappointed. Too, it came with those industrial corn syrup sweeteners, that are just empty calories and not conducive to good health. No Log Cabin nor Mrs. Butterworth in the house. True, it was edible and the bacon was fine, but these days I have reservations about putting such ersatz materials in my body, and would gladly pay extra for pure Grade B maple syrup. \n\nI get that corners must be cut to stay ahead of the game, but I would prefer the choice. \n\nBut, that's just me. \n\nLet's have a better 2022!

Full up at 3 in the afternoon, with a 30 minute wait for a table (or, restrooms), there was nary an empty seat in the house.  The sidewalk was crowded with more people waiting their entry into Valhalla. It's not that the staff wasn't friendly and accommodating, it was just that unless you were totally committed to having brunch on this corner, and had the rest of the day to make your way inside, you might have considered the practical and humane limits of participating in this exercise in mass impulse run amok. Rather than the gates of green heaven, it felt more like Dante's purgatory on an empty stomach. \n\nThe promised thirty soon became 45, without realistic estimate of when a table would be available.  We were welcome to wait with name on list, and add to the aura of the last ship to sail before the invasion, but to do so meant that the rest of the day was shot, and the cost of parking would become exponentially higher; making this a very expensive meal indeed.\n\nIt just wasn't worth it. \n\nSo, we ordered a couple of joes to go, and once received, took our leave.  They were very good, and I imagine that used as a washdown for red velvet pancakes or some other overwrought sweet platter, would do quite nicely.  \n\nCan't hold success against the establishment, but neither do we have to suffer its consequences without reservation.",

The service was prompt and friendly, and I saw no sign of the negativity referenced in other reviews. \n\nUnfortunately, unlike their namesake Albert E., the bagels themselves are not as intelligently conceptualized. Their skin is soft rather than offering a crispness found in more traditional NY style bagels. This suggests the boiling in lye or brine was skipped or inadequate to foster the differing texture signature of the better bagels in the Universe. The overall taste is decent, and they do cover the surface with plenty of toppings (roasted onion flakes for me). Yet, missing a key step in the process relegates their product to strictly second tier status, when it would have been so easy to get it right. \n\nThey do have plenty of options and can throw together a reasonably good sandwich. So, if you don't mind the lack of textural differentiation, you will find the grab, bite and chew satisfying. Otherwise, you will discover yourself wishing for a more complete effort. \n\nTheir coffee is actually better than the bagels.",
