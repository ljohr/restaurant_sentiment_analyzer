    "text": "Returned today for lunch at 12:30.  \n\nThe small dining area was crowded, but I found a deuce in the corner nearest the work area and settled in after ordering their Apple Sausage Special.  \n\nIt arrived about 10 minutes later, a small, but tasty Apple Pork Sausage with Maple Chipotle BBQ Sauce, Grilled Onions, and a boatload of fries.  While it was a very good lunch, a couple of observations need be made.  First, the roll of a potato hot dog roll, which was not as good as a crusty French or Italian alternative would have been.  Second, there were a lot more fries than sausage.  They were good fries, but made the sandwich seem even smaller by comparison. \n\nStill, I liked the ambiance, service, and overall brightness of the place, and did not mind that they made some presentation decisions that detracted from what could have been an exceptional lunch.  \n\nCertainly worth many returns.",

    "text": "Rolling in from Westmoreland County on the Pa Pike, my stomach started growling after almost four hours on the road.  I was near exit 312.  I pulled out my trusty sidekick Mobile Yelp and dialed in \"Thai Restaurant.\"  It came back with two choices in the vicinity, so I opted for the one nearer my location.\n\nThai Place has an unassuming name, but under its self deprecating identity lurks a very fine Thai kitchen and comfortable dining space turning out very good authentic grub. Where many other restos of this genre approach the atmospherics with dark wood and musty scents, this shop is bright, light, and airy.  The owner works the front of the house enthusiastically, while the single server on the floor managed a warm smile and genuine concern for all the patrons. \n\nI ordered the Tom Yum Soup (Vegetables) and Drunken Noodles (Chicken).  Both were excellent.  They asked my preferred spice level between 1 and 3, and I asked for max spice.  That's the way I got it, right at the point where my sinuses start to run. Love it!  There were plenty of Veggies and Tofu in the soup, and even more in the Drunken Noodles.  There was enough for dinner the next night.  \n\nThe only reason Thai Place did not reach the apex was that my Jasmine Tea arrived in a lovely lime green mug with a teabag, rather than a pot of brewing boiling water and loose tea leaves.  That is the best way to achieve full bodied flavor, and requires fewer return visits to refill the mug with hot water.  I get that good tea is expensive and often unappreciated, but for me it sets apart the very good from the superlative.",

    "text": "Mandarin Garden in Willow Grove, Pa., is a throwback type of Chinese restaurant, the kind I went to with family as a kid in New York. Larger space.  Silk wall hangings. Jade sculptures.  Large menu covering most things from Cantonese through Hunan and Szechuan delicacies.  Seniors taking advantage of the Early Bird specials.  My nostalgia surprised me. \n\nMost important, the food was very good.  We were celebrating a first birthday in the USA (Chinese national), and were hoping for something a little extraordinary.  Judging from the approving smiles as each dish was devoured, we got what we came for.  \n\nHot Green Tea arrived immediately along with the dry crisp noodles duck sauce and hot mustard so ubiquitous in Chinese/American houses.  I don't indulge in this table snack, but my friends did in large quantities.  I was selected to do all the ordering, and came up with the following choices: DanDan Noodles (Spicy), Gunpowder Chicken (moderate spice), Jumbo Walnut Shrimp (mild spicy), Crispy Beef with House Made Toffee Cashews (mild spice), Cumin Lamb (spicy), and Tsingtao Beer for all the birthday toasts throughout dinner.  \n\nRealizing that management was Fuzhounese, we did not have high expectations in the spice department.  Their cuisine tends toward sweetness, but there was no harm in asking for some heat.  The kitchen handled each dish in their own fashion.  \n\nThe DanDan Noodles were topped with ground pork and a chili sauce mix that was warm, but not what I was hoping for.  Still, our server anticipated this and had given the table a small dish of chili sauce to upgrade the burn.  I used some of it, but my guests did not.  They were content with what was presented, and not as accustomed to heavy spice as me (Good to know).  \n\nThe Gunpowder Chicken was also on the mildly sweet side, with a trace of chili on the bird breading, but with the sauce sweetened by an apple.  Unusual, and enjoyable, even if not packing heat.  \n\nThe Cumin Lamb was the strongest dish, with plenty of tender meat and cumin, that brought a light sweat to the upper lip.  Not the killer dose of cumin piled on lamb chops in some shops, but strong enough to know they were trying to appease us.  \n\nThe Crispy Beef with Toffee Cashews, was also tending toward sweetness, but they had candied the nuts very well, and when eaten with the copious slices of lightly crisped beef, was fun to eat.  \n\nFinally, the Jumbo Shrimp with Walnuts reinforced the theme that the house interpretation of spice and heat began from the perspective that food from this part of China was always degrees of sweetness or sourness, but not really chili pepper fire breathing dragons.  \n\nAgain, my friends were fine with all of this and genuinely enjoyed their meals.  It was my own blinders about Szechuan flames that was the issue, not the kitchen attempt to move their dial in my direction.  Once I realized that I was making myself too critical of the platters because I wanted my friends to be happy; and that they were already there and praising me for finding such a nice place to celebrate, that I was able to let go, and just roll with the food, and accept that it was really very good.  \n\nGood lesson to learn.  Better to let the house do what it does well, than to ask them to conform to my unrealistic expectations.",

    "text": "As a facility to hold a large luncheon meeting for about 150 lawyers, this Wyndham Garden Hotel in the heart of Trenton, NJ, is reasonably decent. Walking distance from the courthouses, and parking deck next door, it is easily accessible for most who want to attend to get a good meal while listening to a quality presentation on the latest issues in internet discovery requirements and security. These Bench Bar lunches are always a good place to catch up with friends and hobnob with the judges in this vicinage. \n\nThe banquet room was large enough to commodate all of us, had an adequate sound system that everyone could hear clearly, and a catering kitchen that put out a Cornish hen plate that was tasty and attractive. The carrot cake dessert was a bit over the top, but no one was complaining about the buttercream icing. \n\nService was unabtrusive, but kept the meal moving and the water glasses full. \n\nCan't speak to the rooms above, but this operation handled our bar association meeting quite well.",

    "text": "Despite the hour long wait on Friday night, J.B. Dawson's in the Flowers Mill Shopping Center was worth the wait.  Normally, I would see the waiting room crowd and listen to the hostess's lament of the wait time, and walk out immediately. For some reason, my intuition counseled patience, so I took the radio buzzer they handed me, and found three seats to settle in.  \n\nThe  bar was packed with Friday Happy Hour folk getting their zip on, and the two HDTVs in the waiting area were soundlessly tuned to Disney Channel and ESPN.  No one seemed to be paying attention, and the peeps around me were all conversing or buried in their smartphones. The time passed quickly, and we were eventually led to a corner booth in the barroom.  Our server introduced herself, took drink orders and came back promptly to take our order.  We wanted to share the Baby Back Rib and Chicken Tender plate, while young man went with his standard Cheeseburger and Fries.  \n\nDinner took a little while due to the packed house, but not so long as to become an issue.  When it arrived in the hands of a different server, we beheld a half rack of Baby Backs nicely browned and caramelized on top, and a larger pile of Tempura coated white meat Chicken, plus sides of Garlic Mashed Potatoes and Spiced Apples.  I began to salivate involuntarily as the aroma of the BBQ sauce hit me.  I hoped the first bite would be as seductive.  \n\nIt was more than that.   \n\nThe meat easily pulled from the bone.  The taste was very good, and the texture just chewy and tender enough to be completely satisfying.  Although there was very little meat left on the bones, I found myself sucking on them to capture every last bit of BBQ taste.  If anything, the Chicken Tenders were even better and a much bigger surprise.  They were big strips of never frozen chicken, breaded in a Tempura style, that were juicy, lightly crunchy and delicious.  The small mound of Mashed Taters were a nice complement to the more exciting pig and bird, but did a great job absorbing whatever sauce was stuck to the plate.  The Spiced Apple was yet another change of directly with its tartness and heat.  \n\nI did not see a smoker on the premises, nor smell it at work, but regardless of how the meal was prepared, the execution was high end and the experience very solidly worth a return visit.",

What?!  True.\n\nI called and returned the next day for a replacement (They had to order it).  They apologized for the experience, although it was clearly a manufacturer's defect, and discounted it down to the cost of mounting and balancing (normally part of the quoted price). They handled the paperwork. \n\nWhile this was not a fun time, but Keystone stood behind the product and satisfied me of their integrity. I did not have to ask for some consideration. They offered it straight up. \n\nI did not mind the small cost of mounting the new tire in light of how well they handled the situation. \n\n5 Stars if they had taken care of all of it.",

    "text": "When you're down in Bensalem around Neshaminy Mall, finding a good Chinese/Sushi restaurant can be a challenge.  The AMC 24 is a nice place to watch a movie, but the \"dinner and\" part of that is limited in the immediate vicinity unless you like highway-style fast/casual food.  \n\nThen there is Misto Diner, which I found courtesy of Yelp. As other reviewers said, the location on this site is off by about a mile.  It is further down Neshaminy Blvd after passing Bristol Road if coming from the rear of NM, in a small strip mall anchored by 7-11.  Keep going.  You will get there. It is worth the search, as the quality of the room and cuisine are considerably above the standard Chinese American shop.  \n\nWhite table clothes and red cloth napkins are a nice touch suggesting a bit of quality control in the product.  The owner family is present and in charge.  They bring care and pride to the effort.  Although I did not ask, our server seemed to be the father.  He had a Jackie Chan appearance; friendly, engaged, and humorous.  His bifocals tried to hide his bemused visage as we asked questions about the menu and the history of the joint.  \n\nWe settled on Hot and Sour Soup, Chicken Broccoli in Garlic Sauce, and Shredded Pork Mei Fun.  The soup was a rich, thick, spicy mix.  We added a spoonful of Chili Oil to bring out more of the hot richness.  It was a nice improvement to an already good bowl of soup.  The Chicken dish was off menu as we asked for garlic sauce as opposed to the Hunan style base.  The meat was tender and very tasty.  The broccoli cut into small enough sprigs and excellently cooked.  The mei fun was also good, but not at the same level as the other dishes.\n\nTo be clear, Misto Diner is still a traditional Chinese American restaurant found in most suburban areas, but it is a very good one.  It should not be mistaken for an authentic Chinese restaurant found in more heavily Chinese populated parts of the region. But, if you find yourself in this neck of the woods this is a very good choice.  Too, they have no problem giving you an extra pot of tea if you want to wait there for your movie time.",

    "text": "It's a bit surprising to find a decent BBQ joint in a back room of the Best Western Motel on Street Road, Bensalem, Pa.  The place has almost zero atmosphere, no aroma of smoking meat, no beer spillage on the floor, and no one in boots nor large apron cutting the brisket.  There is only Julie, the matron of the house and jack of all serving trades, handling just about everything.  She bartends, takes food orders, serves everything that comes out of the kitchen, and then collects payment at the end of the night.  She makes it personal by asking everyone's first name, and remembering them throughout. \n\nDon't let the environment deter you from coming in.  The grub is very good.  First, there are several beers on tap or bottles, although on this Sunday night they seemed to be out of most of the good crafties.  Still, my End of The World draft was pleasantly cold and refreshing at $4 for 10oz. Friends seemed to be downing Yards brew as quickly as it was poured.  \n\nMy crew of three ordered Half BBQ Chicken (3 sides, corn bread, fries); Coffee Rubbed Brisket (3 sides, hush puppies, fries); and a third rack of St. Louis style Ribs (4 bones, 2 sides, fries).  There was a ton and a half of food.  And, it was all very good to amazing.  The Half Chicken came our golden skinned without a crack in the covering.  It was uber-moist and had a wonderful flavor.  It needed no accompanying sauce to kick it up a notch, as it was really an apex bird.  The Ribs were very good, but not the meatiest I have encountered.  The dry rub was very solid, but I found it needed a little liquid zing to get to my preferred taste level.  The table had 2 unmarked bottle rockets, one based in vinegar, the other, tomato.  Both okay, but not the strength of the cuisine.  \n\nThe unexpected star of the show was the Brisket.  This cut of beef in normally dry in my experience, but this was not the case at Ben's.  Whether the coffee rub, or the time in the smoker, this thin sliced pound of nearly black carne was just so moist, tender and delicious.  The taste of brisket was very present, but the secret sauce brought out undertones and texture that truly opened our eyes.  Even the normal stringiness of the cut was an asset on the platter.  It made for more surface area to hold the smoke and rub.  Can't say that I actually tasted coffee, but that wasn't needed to find this dish remarkable.  \n\nThere are a few downsides to eating at Ben's.  First, service was slow by definition.  Only one person doing everything.  She made a few mistakes on our orders, but nothing so egregious as to require markdowns.  Then, we were given plastic utensils to negotiate the load of food.  They simply were not up to the task of dealing with the meat and sides.  Broken fork prongs, snapped knives were a part of the night.  How much better to invest in real steel blades and spikes to control the contest.  As mentioned above, they seemed to be out of many of their listed brews. \n\nPrices are fair for the menu and (lack of) atmosphere.  \n\nPut the smokers out in the parking lot for all to see, maintain your beer inventory, and provide customers with the tools to subdue the wild animals on our plates, and Ben (Franklin)'s could become a great BBQ mainstay in this area.",

    "text": "I found myself here for lunch and dinner one day last week due to a long court appearance.  I have no complaints about the kitchen, nor the service of Spice Thai Cuisine. \n\nThe space is all cool dark wood and deep red texture that took me far away from the courthouse for a peaceful interlude.  The young server was gracious, engaging and had a high watt smile that made ordering a pleasure.  I asked if this was truly a Thai house, and she assured me the owner and chef were legit.  \n\nFor lunch I had the Hot Jungle Special at heat level 4 (out of 7).  The plate arrived loaded with fresh veggies and a mildly pepper/curry sauce that brought everything together nicely, but wasn't quite the inferno I was looking for.  Still, it was totally enjoyable, and I used it as a measure should I chose to return for another round.  That I returned for dinner was totally unexpected, unless you consider leaving a briefcase behind as an act of kismet.  I had to return that evening to get it, and while there decided to sit for dinner. \n\nI supped on Pad Thai with Calamari and heat level 5. This was more like it!  The meal arrived in a large ceramic plate with a built in pedestal.  It looked beautiful.  The spice level was excellent, and the Calamari was fresh and scored in a crosshatch pattern to expose max surface area.  It was soft and pliant.  The overall experience was delicious. I took enough home for another dinner.\n\nSpice Thai Cuisine is a very good restaurant, if not quite at the level of Aroi Thai or some of the other specialty houses in the area.  No doubt, it could reach that apex with a little more time and imagination.",

On impulse I went in this morning to see what was available for breakfast.  The friendly assistant bakery/counter person told me the muffins were still in the oven, but they had very fresh Blueberry Cream Cheese Scones available.  She pointed to them and allowed me to come around the counter to have a closer look (and take a photo).  \n\nI don't know much about scones, except for eating them a few years ago when in England.  I remembered a hard, cookie-like outside and a textured chew.  These were quite different. They were the shape of scones, and soft through and through. No crunch. Much like a muffin in the shape of a scone. I liked it, the same as I would have enjoyed the muffin. Perhaps they were less sweet than their cousins. \n\nThe loaves of bread were tempting, and I will try some of them over time.  The coffee was good, the beans roasted locally.  \n\nTheir wall menu suggests that their sandwiches are worth trying, as does the video attached to this Yelp listing.  \n\nI look forward to future visits and sampling more of what appears to be high end healthy bread and all things that can be created out of it.  \n\nVery happy to have them in Newtown.",

    "text": "I found Kriscroix while cruising Yelp for a change of pace meal in the area. Yesterday, I finally had the time to go there for an early lunch after dropping son off at the mall for a Magic tournament (that's another story). \n\nOn first approach it is easy to miss this place on the end of a small strip on the south side of a particularly ugly stretch of Rt. 1 in Fairless Hills. The signage is small, and first glance is of a store that looks like a beer distributor, with many brew signs on the windows.  Don't be deterred.  Walk in, turn left, and you are in a 1970's dining room with comfortable blue leatherette booths, brass fitting, and wall to wall maritime memorabilia.  Very seaworthy!\n\nI was fortunate to have Tracy as my server.  She was friendly, funny, and took time and pride to show me through the menu and make useful suggestions.  From the reviews I knew I was going to have good choices, but decided to go with the standard Fish and Chips for my first taste.  It was a nice size Cod Fillet, batter dipped in a light English style coating, and fried enough to slightly harden the batter into a shell that left the fish soft and tender.  No oily taste nor texture.  The French Fries were not house made, but still crispy and fresh tasting. It came with Tartar Sauce or Cocktail Sauce.  I did not ask for Malt Vinegar, but I suspect it was back in the kitchen.  A tin of Old Bay was also placed on the table for the fries. A side of Cole Slaw came along for the ride. It was mayo based, but also fresh and enjoyable.  All the while Tracy was refilling my coffee mug, and telling me more about the restaurant. The only thing missing was having the Fish and Chips served in a newspaper cone as done in England. \n\nI don't normally do dessert, but Tracy asked if I wanted to hear what was available.  Ok. I was game to listen. She said a few options, and then got to the Fried Oreos and Fried Twinkies. What?!  I went for it. \n\nA few minutes later out came a large white shallow bowl with four halves of Twinkies, apparently wrapped in a crepe-like blanket, covered in powdered sugar, and drizzled with raspberry sauce.  The Twinkie Cream was slightly oozing out and mixing with the white and red.  \n\nHow did it taste?  Well, imagine the first time you ate a Twinkie as a kid; that soft, sweet, creamy surprise...Now, imagine it hot, with extra sugar, and a hint of raspberry stirring your palate... Taste it? \n\nIt was a fun dessert.  \n\nKriscroix Restaurant. Highly Recommended for fish and fun.",

    "text": "Slate Bleu (Blue Slate) Restaurant is part of a very attractive adaptive reuse of an old brick 19th Century building in Doylestown.  For that alone, the structure is worth a close look. The architect gets 5 Stars for adaptation and execution. \n\nThe restaurant is Au Provence French style look and feel.  Dark wood tones, center floor bar, and a quiet sensibility with white tablecloths, benches along the walls, and simple chairs.  The bartender (owner?) serves as hostess and ma\u00eetre d., serving drinks to the tables after she makes them. A nice touch.  Our waitress was friendly, knowledgeable and unobtrusive. \n\nThe dinner menu is not extensive, but covers all the food groups.  The chef is creative and makes the effort to bring his best to his work.  We had the Green Salad, Bronzino with a Fruit Salsa Sauce, and for dessert shared a Pistachio Souffle.\n\n The salad was basically a fresh spring mix, but with a dressing that tasted weak in combination with the greens.  The Bronzino (Mediterranean Sea Bass) was very well presented, light tasting with a tasty Mexican-esque fruit salsa combination piled high on the fillet. It was very enjoyable. It was a daily special @ $28 per. Finally, the Souffle was made from scratch and came with a gravy boat full of hot chocolate for pouring into its center.  While very light, fluffy and yummy, the $15. plus price was a chill to the digestion. (I knew in advance and decided to bite the silver bullet in favor of making my companion happy. You know how that is.) \n\nSo, although Slate Bleu is an attractively appointed French/Country space, and the cuisine is very good for the most part, there is a sticker shock that accompanies the experience.  While I would return, it will only be when I have a very special occasion. When a dinner for two comes in over the century mark without drinks, reservations about reservations are appropriate.",

Poetic license for a largely underappreciated songwriter and rock performer, Warren Zevon. He spent a lot of time in the city, especially in the early 1980s, when he was living with, and ultimately married to a well know radio DJ here. They lived on Rittenhouse Square for several years, before divorce drove him back to California.  If you were very fortunate, you saw his concert at the TLA on South Street, and had your musical life changed.\n\n He really visited the small Cantonese restaurant on the corner of 11th and Spring Streets and used it for inspiration for the song, \"Werewolves of London.\" Even the kitchen door in an alley off Spring Street, found its way into the lyrics, as the door you must not open unless you sought the fate of the, \"Little old lady, got mutilated late last night...\" It remains a scary place even today with decades of thick, black grease caked to the walls and pavement. Who knows what evil lurks in those sewer drains?! \n\nSo, I was there the other day after a haircut across the street. I had been singing his songs as I drove to Philly, and wanted to pay homage to the man and have some good Cantonese food. \n\nThe dining room was small, with no more than eight tables. It was well preserved in dark mahogany stained panels.  It was fairly clean and tidy for a joint in C.Town. We were the only customers on arrival, and took liberties to walk around a bit and take a few photos. Amazingly, not a thing memorializing Zevon. Maybe this third generation Asian kitchen doesn't know from American rock and roll. Warren would no doubt get a laugh out of that. \n\nWe ordered Salt Baked Squid, Orange Beef and Fish Hot Pot; more than enough for two of us, but plenty to bring home for the sons. They were all very good, if not best of breed. The squid was tender and mildly salty as expected.  The beef was plentiful with a good dark red amber sauce and sliced onion and green pepper. The fish arrived in a covered casserole still bubbling from the fire in the kitchen. Soft, moist and delicious. Each dish was $11.95. Credit cards accepted. \n\nThis was one of the better Cantonese meals eaten in C.Town, made more desirable by the ability to think about Warren Zevon sitting at the table in back, chowing down and noodling about a song that we are still singing long after his death. \n\nAaoooooooo!",

I think I also recognized some of the clerks and cashiers. \n\nAnywho, this store carries almost everything you needed for a well stocked Asian kitchen. From butcher to fishmonger, soy sauce and vinegar, noodles from around the world, and even those secret ingredients needed for great dumplings, are right at hand. Vietnam, Thailand, Korea, Cambodia and China are all well represented. The green grocer department has fruit and veggies that often can only be found where they are grown in Asia. They even had a box of super fat green frogs for exotic eating or taking home as pets. \n\nIt was a pleasure to grab a grocery cart after a good dim sum brunch right next door and walk it off up and down the aisles.  The free parking replicates what they have down the city, but it sure makes life easier not to have to hunt and pay for a space for wheels.",

    "text": "Papillon Cafe in Goodnoe Corner, Newtown, PA, was a first for me. A French Kosher Organic Cafe in the heart of this 325 year old ville. It is a sign of the growing diversity in my home town, and it may actually make it, with something tasty for everyone. Even plenty for gluten frees.\n\nThis Sunday afternoon, only the owner was running the show. He had a perfect friendly personality, making me feel immediately welcome. His middle eastern accent with French lilt suggested the nature of the house. The shelf full of great looking pastries was one direction, the long list of crepes, another; and Paninis and onion soup, yet other possibilities. The weather frigid, I went for a hot tuna melt panini and coffee washdown. \n\nThe plate was served by the Le Monsieur, sporting the split sandwich on crisp and crumbly pressed baguette, and a pile of thin sliced pan fried potatoes with a garlicky white sauce drip. They were fine, if not inspired. Certainly, a solid contribution for lunch. The pomme frite were interesting - served cold. Rather than being the expected French fries, it became a very good cool potato salad side dish. Like it, even if unintended.\n\nThe java was also surprising. Although equipped for expresso drinks, all I wanted was something hot and strongly caffeinated. What I received was a corrugated paper cup that required no heat shielding cuff (clever). For the milk stir-in, I was handed the large stainless frothing pitcher full of cow juice, heated with the steam wand. I poured and stirred like a rookie barista. Great touch, and the Groundwork beans showed their strong roasted roots. Impressive.\n\nI really liked Papillon, but it could use a little TLC. With only one person doing the entire operation, the details  got away from him. Someone bussing tables and sweeping up would eliminate crumbs on tables and floor and make the experience an unqualified pleasure.\n\n3.5 STARS",

    "text": "Our very personable waitperson described Jones as serving, \"American Comfort Food.\"  Even before seeing the menu my mind was wandering about what that would mean to my Chinese friends experiencing local cuisine for just about the first time.  For me, a brownie and a glass of milk is comfort food, but for anyone lacking a database of experience, they might have some fairly wild ideas.  \n\nTurns out, they didn't have a clue and relied on me to order for them.  Okay. I was up for the challenge.  How about a good burger for the 19 year old, and a turkey club for his mother?  Handled.  I've been curious about the chicken & waffles craze, so when I saw it on the menu, I stopped reading.  \n\nWe were all satisfied with our lunches.  The burger was a big hit with the young guy.  He believes burgers are the height of American culture.  He could be right.  Turkey is not well known in China, but the combination with bacon, lettuce, spicy mayo and tomato seemed to captivate my friend.  I moved quickly to remove the long wooden picks used to hold each quarter together, as she was unaccustomed to this shiv and nearly poked her eye out.  \n\nThe fried chicken arrived as a breast/thigh combo with golden brown crispy coat.  It was good, but perhaps a little too salty.  The waffle was the better companion, done well on an iron and still steamy soft within with a hint of sweetness to counterbalance the NaCl on the bird.  As a lover of Southern Fried Chicken, I did not truly appreciate the passionate embrace of these two carb loads on one plate.  Call me old fashioned, but I will stick with waffles for breakfast and fried chicken for other meals; although I might be convinced to change my mind if someone poured pure maple syrup over both and allowed me this sticky indulgence. \n\nJones is a very nice facility with high ceilings, which make the brown sandstone columns around the house quite attractive and draw eyes upward, giving the sense of a mountain lodge in Red Rock, Sedona.  \n\nMade the saying of \"Grace\" seem totally appropriate.",

It came highly recommended by my friends who work in the area, and rightly so.\n\nService was above average in that promptness and smiles were part of the interaction with the servers.  My only nit was that there were two large HDTVs on the walls that were both tuned to the same channel that no one was watching, although the Eagles preseason game was available.  They just couldn't manage to change over to the game despite saying they would.  I just decided to finish quickly, and catch the game on the car radio.  \n\nThe dinner was good aside from that annoyance. Scallion Pancakes were two deep and as wide as a large dinner plate.  Not too greasy, and enough green onion flavor.  The Pork Cutlets were large, well fried and very tasty is a good Garlic Sauce.  There was some bone left, but it was easy to pick them up and work the meat off.  I appreciated that they were a large size and non-oily.  The ubiquitous Broccoli Florets were ho-hum. \n\nShing Kee is a definite keeper, especially in light of the absence of many legit alternatives in the area.  It also is a good driving destination as they are in a shopping center with a decent parking lot.  While there, there are a couple of markets for grabbing your Asian ingredients for your adventures in Asian cooking.",

Each has a few restaurants in them, but unless you know what you are looking for you are likely to become numb from their sameness and just keep driving. Taj India could unfortunately suffer than ignominious fate, but luckily is located right next door to the new Georgian Breads, and a street before the new Super Wawa.  It is worth finding. \n\nThis is a vegetarian house.  Their menu consists of six pages of mostly Kerala delights, with a little other North and South India thrown in to keep it interesting and popular. It was a perfect place to settle down after excellent foot massage right up the road at Lavendar Spa.  \n\nWe shared these dishes: Sweet Corn Soup, Chili Pakoda, Kaju Curry, Vegetable Jalfrezi and Garlic Naan.  All were good to near excellent, except for the Masala Tea which was tasteless and disappointing. I love most forms of corn soup, and this was fairly standard. Sweet kernels with a light dusting of curry. Not sure if it came from a fresh ear of corn or a can, but it was still good.  The Chili Pakora was a nice surprise - Jalapeno peppers stuffed with mashed potato and spices, dipped in a heavy pakora breading and deep fried.  Very spicy and a strong nod to Indo-Mex cuisine.  The Kaju (cashew) Curry was a cool play on nuttiness in a mild, almost sweet pale orange curry.  Terrific. Perfect for sopping up with the Garlic Naan, which was more lightly tandoored than most I have eaten.  The texture was not heavy with oil nor garlic, despite its strong taste.  Very well done. Finally, the Veggie Jalfrezi provided a mix of mostly standard local green is a pleasant moderately heated curry.  We went with Level 5 on all dishes, except the Chili, and found it adequate for our tastes.  Regardless, some were hotter than others, but quite satisfactory across the board.  \n\nService was friendly and efficient, and prices on the pleasant side of reasonable. $44 for all the above four dishes, naan and tea.\n\nThere are several decent Indian kitchens in this area, and Taj should be on your list when in the neighborhood and in the mood for quality vegetarian meals.",

    "text": "Rediscovering Bordentown, I stopped into Angie's Family Restaurant for breakfast last week to check it out. \n\nTrue, there is something of a time vortex effect within its shop.  The colorful hand painted murals, lazy tables basking in the sun along the front windows, and the small counter with maybe a half dozen spinners, all combined to catch me off guard and drop me into somewhere in my youth, perhaps 1972 in Boulder, Colorado.  \n\nIt may have played tricks with my mind, but it did not impact my taste buds.  My French Toast, Orange Juice and Coffee Special was fresh and tasty. The FT nicely cauterized by the hot grill to provide the light crunch I crave. My server wasn't Angie (I asked), but she and her mother had worked with Ms. A for many years and knew her to be a lovely person.  \n\nIn fact, this joint is so square it's hip.  It suits its neighborhood in this transforming river town.  If Bonaparte was still here, he would be a regular.  \n\nThose fortunate enough to come often must call this place, \"Angie's,\" as there is no need for the rest of the name.  \n\nAngie speaks for herself.\n\nAPRIL 2, 2015 UPDATE - Went with the Breakfast Special today; Kielbasi, Onion and Jalapeno Omelet @ $8.95, a bit pricey compared to the rest of the menu, but I liked the concept.  It included Home Fries, Toast and Coffee.  The Omelet was not as I imagined it.  Rather than chunks of fresh Kielbasi from the Polish deli, it was a thin sliced pink colored processed meat-food that had no resemblance in look, nor taste to the Polish Sausage.  Too, the Jalapenos were the pickled and sliced version, rather than fresh pepper cut and saut\u00e9ed before being thrown into the mix.  Overall, a disappointment.  Stick with the tried and true regular menu options going forward.",

    "text": "Dos Amores (Two Loves) Mexican Cuisine is a strictly take out stall in the Village of Newtown Farmers Market. Along with the rest of the shops it is only open Thursday through Saturday, so there is only a small window for getting in/out with a good sampling of their south of the border offerings. Most are of the self contained variety, like enchiladas, quesadillas, empanadas and chile rellenos, that can be prepared in advance, kept cool and then heated at home in the microwave or oven. You can also eat in the market within the common dining area at the back of the store. \n\nThat is what I did. I ordered beef and chicken empanadas, and asked them to be heated for consumption in the market. That took all of 3 minutes. They were handed to me in a paper boat with small containers of salsa and sour cream. Other sides were available, but as it was my first dive into their delectables, I opted to forego any additions. \n\nBoth empanadas were very good. The dough was crisp and strong enough to stay together as I bit through them. The chicken and ground beef were both nicely spiced, and I was also able to pour more salsa inside through the bite hole, and keep it contained until next munch. The beef was cooked with more chili powder, and had a warmer profile than the chicken. Still, I enjoyed them both for their freshness and authenticity. Like everything else in this market, prices are high. You pay the same as if you were dining in a full service restaurant. \n\nThe atmosphere of the farmers market is entertaining with all the Amish/Mennonite vendors dressed in their traditional garb and speaking colloquially. That is certainly worth the premium paid, as it is the only place in town where there is a real cultural exchange. Admittedly, Dos Amores lacks the Pennsylvania Dutch accent, but their Spanish makes up for that. \n\nI really should come here more often just to step away from modern times for a little while and enjoy all the interesting grub.",

Still found a spot for the wheels and walked into a doughy time machine.  The high glass display counters. Back shelves filled with donuts, loaves of many types, and great guttural Trentonese dialect, sent me back in time to when there were several awesome Italian bakeries in the Burg, and they competed with each other for quality dominance.  The last baker standing is the latest incarnation of IPB, for whatever might be missing, their bread remains classic and museum worthy.  \n\nThe deli in back still offers wonderful sandwiches with the star of the show always the bread in which it is captured.  On two recent visits I found that the Home Roasted Turkey, Swiss, Lettuce and Mayo on Onion Roll, and the follow up Chicken Salad on small Torpedo Roll, to be delicious and priced for smiles.  Zaftig sandwiches like these for under $5, are too good to be true, unless the kitchen and ovens are trapped in the prior century.  Each creation was really two meals.  The wall of drink coolers provided substantial choice, and there was always budgetary room for one of their large cookies, cannoli, or even deep double fudge brownies.  \n\nYes. You do have to navigate into the inner recesses of Chambersburg, and deal with all the one way streets, and the sudden loss of GPS signals.  But, once you're there and exploring this historic haven, you are in for a mighty treat.",

It has a 1960's feel to it, with indoor/outdoor dining and order/pickup windows. You order and the receipt has a number that will be called when your meal is ready.  \n\nWe stopped in after shopping in the area for a late lunch.  We ordered their Original Burger (Double with cheese, onion, lettuce, tomato, mayo and a spicy chipotle-type sauce, on a bun), and a Southwest Burger (avocado, lettuce, tomato, cheese and extra spicy sauce).  The combo provides an ample load of fries and a large drink, so we ordered one combo to share those extras. At $14, it was a good deal.\n\nThe burgers were hand packed and loose enough to grill up well and retain that special grease that makes good burgers, great. They reminded of 5 Guys, but better in that they were not crushed in wrapping, and the sauces were nicely complimentary.  Liked them a lot.  Only negative was the quality of the roll, which was not strong enough to hold together after a few bites.  It became necessary to find the plastic forks so as to avoid having to pick up the pieces falling out of the sandwich with sticky fingers. A better roll (potato or Kaiser) would offer longer support for the weighty innards. The fries were well done (the way I like them), and the lemonade tart enough to quench two dry whistles. \n\nWe didn't get a chance to try the ice cream, as although we sat outside under blue sunny skies at first, by the time we were halfway through the meal, the skies had darkened, and it was raining pretty hard, forcing us inside, where it was crowded and difficult to move around.  Will try their 'scream next time. \n\nAll in all, a pleasant burgerlicious experience.",

From ground level, the soaring towers and thick cables looked like a magical castle drawbridge. Even now I get an excited sensation every time I walk or drive over even the most modest crossing over a creek.  \n\nIt is hard to believe that before 1926 when the Ben was opened there was only ferry service carrying people and commerce across the Delaware.

It can be maddening to deal with the traffic during rush hours, and the cost makes us wish for the return of ferries.  Still, when it lights up at night, or we cross it on a weekend and can look upstream or down, the sense of flight and the required leap of faith that the roadway will hold us on our passage to the other side, blend into a metaphor for life.   \n\nSomeone once said, \"Great cities have great bridges...\"  I am sure Ben would agree.",

Way above my pay grade!  \n\nSo, breaking it down into the elements I thought involved, I went first to a fabric store to find material for drapes.  Twenty overwhelming and mind numbing minutes later, I was defeated by the aisle upon aisle of material that could be used to make curtains.  No wonder it had taken so long for me to address this project.  \n\nSerendipity plays funny games, and if not for my tortured look as I approached a saleswoman at the measuring/cutting counter in the rear of this megastore, I might have never known of Marburn Curtains.  I asked this saintly person how I should approach buying fabric for curtains, and how find someone to actually measure and make them.  She looked at me as if I was not the first clueless guy to ask this dumb question.  It was like; \"If you gotta ask, then you really don't want to know...\"  \n\nShe was right.

They can help you out.\"  \n\nThirty minutes later I walked into this throwback 20th Century warehouse/store that had more curtains hanging in the aisles than I could look at.  The shop was staffed by a crew of ladies whose life was curtains.  One took my hand and led me to the back of the store where the kind of curtains I described were displayed.  We were down to less than a hundred now, and the task seemed manageable.  I finally selected the two packs of 60 X 84 beautiful beige lined silk-like pieces, complete with grommet holes and the necessary hardware for installation.   \n\nAll this and immense piece of mind for under $70.  What had been so daunting was reduced to a simple transaction.  \n\nNext step - installation. \n\n(To be continued)",

We wish them great success there!  I mention its neighbor because that is the way I first noticed this shop set back from the street.  I came out of Duck Sauce and walking on the covered front porch I noticed the new store and went in to have a look.  \n\nI didn't know that homemade chocolate would taste so good after a good spicy Asian meal, but it did!  In fact, I suggest that these owners talk to each other and start to cross market their goods.  A little chocolate delivered with the lunch or dinner bill would be a great touch (and better than the Andes Mints).  A discount coupon for a quality Chinese or Thai repast with the purchase of $10. worth of candy, would also be a hot commodity.  Maybe they are already doing that, but I did not see it. Come talk to me.\n\nS/P is a veritable wonderland of sweets set in a well appointed comfortable setting. Made to look \"country,\" it succeeds in taking you away from the world outside and dropping you into a childhood daydream.  Hard not to smile and salivate when looking at the enormity of the collection here, and reminiscing about those candies you craved as a kid.  \n\nYes. It is a little decadent, but it is so innocent that no one will turn you in to the diet police.",

Everything looked fresh and well maintained. Prices were better than the Asia basement store, and the crowded aisles we're ample proof. \n\nThere are only handheld baskets as there is no room for shopping carts. That limits how much you can buy in one visit unless you come with a team to help carry your take. There is constant bumping into folks, and the floor around the seafood department is always damp, so some caution is required. But, the jostling is worthwhile to secure the quality goods offered here. Just be sure to secure your wallet because there is more than one type of fishing going on. \n\nWe picked up meat, veggies and eggs ($3.50 for 3 doz. XLs!), paying much less than in the aforementioned dungeon. The cashier line runs up the vegetable aisle, so you can imagine the low level confusion going on. \n\nStill, if you enjoy interacting with humanity the experience was almost enjoyable. Just glad we weren't running for a bus.",

I sat at the short counter where I was attended to by several people.  Coffee arrived promptly, and my order was taken with interest.  The server wanted to be sure that I knew what I was getting with the Gus' Special Omelet.

That was exactly what I wanted. \n\nIt arrived about ten minutes later, filling the entire plate from rim to rim.  The rye toast arrived a few moments later, lathered in butter. A few shakes of the pepper shaker and I was good to go. \n\nIt was a solid, filling meal.  Plenty of ingredients to load it up, with each element identifiable on the tongue. Maybe, a little more feta would have been helpful. The toast was also worthy of special recognition, as it was very hot from the toaster, and had a great crunch. \n\nNext time, have to try the namesake waffles.",

    "text": "Ashni Kumar Guru is the master chef and personality behind Guru Indian Cuisine on Cambridge Lane in Newtown, Pa.  It is housed in the former Mexican/Guatemalan restaurant, Mamita's, and retains the colors and Latin feel.  It reminds of the Indo-Mex restaurants I ran into in Montreal; full blown spice assault with a Tequila chaser. \n\nChef Guru has a great feel for the elements of Indian cooking; mixing taste, texture and color with fresh ingredients to produce an array of very good to excellent plates that are as appealing to the eye, as to the tongue.  He makes a point of coming out to meet his customers to be sure they are satisfied and inquire about anything they might desire.  His visage tucked under a Philly's cap was a personal touch that is so often lacking in other restaurants.  \n\nWe came in for Saturday buffet around 1:00.  The joint was empty but for us.  Surprising given the popularity of the place, but maybe not given it being the day after Christmas.  The spread was attractive, but fairly limited in options, with only a handful of offerings from all food groups.  It was enough to get an idea about the quality of the food, but not enough to really sample a broad cross section of the menu.  I am neglectful to record what we were eating, but the two chicken dishes were very good with wonderful creamy spiced tawny sauces, and the vegetable choices were tasty.  Fresh Naan brought hot to the table was a great approach to balancing the more mass produced buffet table with something prepared just for us.  As always, the Naan was a wonderful pinch and sponge to grab all the delicious sauces on the plate.  Contrarily, the Mango Lassi was watery and tasted of coming from a mix, rather than any approximation of fresh fruit. \n\nI want to return to order off the menu to experience main courses prepared only for us, as something is always lost with a buffet.  After experiencing Guru's apex efforts I will be in a better position to fully appreciate the magic of his kitchen.\n\nJANUARY 21, 2016 - The Bucks County Department of Health just cited Guru for 13 health code violations dealing with hand washing, proper cooling. All correctable, but stay informed about this by visiting the County website where the reports and follow up inspections are found.\n\nFEBRUARY 23, 2016 -  Updated Inspection Report. Many violations corrected.",

Nonetheless, some kind of magic is happening in the kitchen that is creating more distinct and enjoyable dishes from the lunch menu.  \n\nToday, the Hot & Sour Soup took me by surprise.  I told the Mrs. that I did not want MSG in it, and she assured me there would be none.  Sure enough, the small bowl arrived without the telltale sheen on the surface that denotes the presence of the food enhancer to which I am allergic. It was loaded with tofu, sprouts and other veggies, and had a great taste.  Next up was the Roast Pork Egg Foo Young.  It came out as two pancake omelets full of sliced pork, veggies, and covered in the ubiquitous brown sauce.  The eggs were not particularly oily and the sauce was hot without the aftertaste of sitting around too long.  Liked it a lot. \n\nNo one will mistake China Caf\u00e9 for fine dining, but it seems to have found its equilibrium at a higher point than most other local wok shops.  The ingredients seemed fresher, and the attention to detail and timing of the elements more rigorous.  Given that I rarely give such houses more than an Okay grade, the upmark for this place is significant.  \n\nWhatever the reason, China Caf\u00e9 has my appreciation, with sincere hope that it continues on this path.",

    "text": "Very glad I went alone to check out Texas Roadhouse on Street Road, Bensalem, PA. The wait for a table would have been at least an hour given the size of the SRO crowd in the entranceway and milling by the front door. Solo I was able to find the solitary empty bar stool and jump right on without putting my name on a waiting list. This was a first experience with this outfit and I was amazed by the full house and amplitude of the noise. \n\nWhat was going on here to make it so popular? I soon found out.\n\nNo fewer than 3 bartenders stopped by to introduce themselves within the first ten minutes, with the first taking my order for a Sam's Winter Ale pint and a Smokehouse Burger. They all called me by name and seemed genuinely interested in my satisfaction. Despite the full house, and arrival of a few couples now standing around the small square bar hoping for a double vacancy, I never felt rushed nor put upon for ordering a sandwich rather than a large slab of grilled beef and dinner. \n\nAnd, the medium finish burger was exactly what I got. Half pounder. Hot pink core. Cheddar/American cheese blend. Tomato. Red onion. Mushroom. BBQ sauce. Sesame seed roll. Squirt of Heinz red and I was ready to dive in. \n\nIt was excellent. Juicy and textured with luscious profile as I cleaved through it exposing a cross section of the large sandwich. Its 5 inch height was too much for my jaw to expand around, so I ended up using knife and fork to get the job done. Definitely fair value at $12 and change. The tag along fries were not as good, and I left most of them behind. \n\nFolks on either side of me were into their steaks, and seemed as content as me in their choices. Must admit that the aroma from all that sizzling meat was intoxicating. \n\nLeaving the house about an hour later it was even more crowded and louder than when I arrived. I wend my way through the peeps into the open air. So many families waiting to be fed; content to wait as long as it took to partake of the kitchen fare. Now I understood why. For meat lovers this was paradise on a budget. A place they could afford to take their families, have a filling tasty meal, and not break the bank. \n\nDel Frisco's it wasn't. Nor did anyone want it to be.",

I saw Liberty Bell Gastropub right off the casino floor and walked in to see what was going on. \n\nThe bar was a large rectangle with plenty of open seats. I grabbed one after the hostess said I was free to do so. The space is attractively appointed with very high wood planked ceiling and large HDTVs all around. The bartenders were friendly and efficient. I asked for a menu and then saw the Happy Hour card standing on the bar near me. I realized that HH was from 9 to 11, and that I was right in the middle of it. It had more or less what I wanted (burger & beer) and nice discounts. I went with their Smokehouse Burger (gouda, bacon, BBQ sauce on brioche bun), side of mashed rather than fries, and a Victory Prime Pilsner. $7 savings made for a great and tasty deal. \n\nThe burger was the perfect medium finish requested, and the garlicy mashed potatoes a pleasant alternative to overworked fries. The Philly brewed Victory beer was a cold refreshing washdown. Also nice to have linen napkin and heavy grade flatware on hand. \n\nAll in all, Liberty Bell Gastropub could easily stand on its own as a high quality roadside stop. Of course, the gambling operation no doubt subsidizes the cost in order to keep people near the gaming tables. Still, it was a job well done.",

    "text": "Unable to reach my regular dentist after several calls, it was time to find someone who was actually available for treatment. After Yelp search and word of mouth inquiries, I chose Smile Culture Dental in Levittown for necessary and emergent dental care. \n\nTheir facility on Oxford Valley Road was bigger than expected, especially after being accustomed to a one man office prior to this visit. The waiting area was attractive, with comfortable seating, and a self serve coffee station for all visitors. The sign in process had a few pages to read and sign, but that was simple and the folks behind the counter were pleasant and efficient. After about a 15 minute wait, we were called into the working area, and walked down a long half-walled hallway with dental chairs on both sides. I think I saw five work stations for the three dentists in the practice. Dr. Patel introduced himself in his aquamarine scrubs. He was friendly and had no problem with answering questions and explaining what he was seeing and what he intended to do about it. \n\nHe worked with a dental assistant who knew her stuff and had a warm and empathetic personality. When we heard the diagnosis of a broken molar that required extraction, and that he was going to remove the tooth immediately with consent, he gave his patient time to absorb what was going to happen, ask questions, and think about it before seeking approval.  When that was forthcoming, an office/billing person came over with surgical consent form and billing information for signing. It was professionally done. Not high pressure in any way. \n\nDr. Patel had a steady hand and explained the procedure from anesthesia through means of extraction and post op expectations. He was patient and had an easy, yet knowledgeable manner. He described what he was seeing and doing in a play by play narrative that was simple and understandable. Twenty minutes later the offending tooth was in the grip of his extractor (pliers), and he was packing the vacated space with artificial bone to maintain spacing and have a base for future implant. \n\nHe provided prescriptions for antibiotic and pain management (if needed), and explained proper home care and next visit. The cost was fair, especially compared with dental offices closer to home (upscale communities have upscale dentists). They seem to have some flexibility in pricing and a program for regular visits and maintenance if desired. We deferred that decision pending the outcome of this experience. \n\nFor the moment, I am quite satisfied with how we were treated at Smile Culture Dental. Should anything change, I will be sure to let you know.",

Me thinks the Mayura may break that trend and hang around for a long while. The dining room is colorful, the service is friendly, if not quite polished, and the menu is South Indian with an interesting list of vegetarian and non-vegetarian choices. \n\nWe went with appetizers of Veggies Samosas, Onion Bajhi; large bowls of Vegetable Korma and Chicken Masala, and a smaller plate of Indo Chinese Chili Chicken. A basket of Garlic Ginger Naan and supply of Basmati Rice completed the table. Of course, we ordered way too much, but after tasting everything, we were happy to bring the leftovers home. \n\nThe Samosas were golden fried and filled with mashed potatoes and green peas. Very good. The Onion Bajhi were basically dipped and deep fried in a light flour batter, made to be complemented by an excellent sweet/tart tamarind sauce. The Korma was a load of soft veggies in a dark tan cashew mild curry reduction. The Masala was darker and spicier, while the Chili Chicken was a decent rendition of the interaction between Chinese and Indian notions of inbred meals, not as crisp as found in Tibet, but leaning on Szechuan red chili with tumeric bite from south of the border. Each was a carousel of flavor and texture that deserved a trek in the high mountains between the two nations where life is hard , yet a grand adventure. We enjoyed it all. Oh, and the Naan was great with that hint of ginger mixed with garlic. \n\nThe only downside was the Mango Lassi, which was from a mix that was so thick that it could not be pulled through a straw, and required major dilution with water in order to get it down the gullet. \n\nOtherwise, Mayura was all around a strong showing with only slight fraying around the edges.",

Yelp reviews were very positive, and it had been a while since I had anything more than a cup of great coffee (Calm Waters Coffee Roasters) in this old river city. \n\nThe bar/dining room is small, with square bar and perhaps ten to fifteen stools and equal number of tables.  The room is dark with several HDTVs for sport enthusiasts. The crowd was a mix of octogenarians  and middle aged folks, who all seemed to get along smashingly.  Drinks were very reasonably priced, and the custom beer list, while limited, had enough for us to be satisfied. Service was prompt and friendly with black T-shirted smiling servers always available to bring what you needed.  \n\nThe kitchen feels mostly homegrown talent.  They know what they are doing, especially in the realm of American or ethno-American cuisine.  The plates are full to overflowing, while still being dusted with herb and sauce for that new-American high end look.  I came for the Meatloaf and was lucky enough to discover it was \"Meatloaf Night.\"  Saved a buck or two.  The meal was very good, with Garlic Mashed and fresh Steamed String Beans.  Liked it a lot!  \nMy companions ordered Lobster Mac and Cheese, which came in a low baking dish, topped with Bread Crumbs and melted Cheese.  It was tasty, but to my tongue, the cheese was too strong for the Lobster and hid much of its flavor.  The third entre, a Chicken/Shrimp Thai Curry with Brown Rice, was weaker, as we knew Thai food too well to find this imitation close enough to experience and expectations.  The curry was a little off as if they might not have had all the ingredients needed for authenticity.  Plenty of bird and shellfish. \n\nWe also ordered the Buffalo Cheesesteak & Fries app.  It was huge and plenty hot between the Buffalo Red Sauce and semi-melted Blue Cheese.  Our twenty year old inhaled most of this.  It was a big hit. \n\nAll in all, we enjoyed our evening at The Pines.  This is far more than your average neighborhood tavern.  A real effort has been made to polish the kitchen and bring in people who want more than just bar food.  In this they have succeeded, even if not perfectly. \n\nWe applaud the effort and love the atmosphere. \n\nWe will be back.",

Where the focus was formerly on excellent xiao long bao and other Shanghai delights, it has now expanded to include a strong taste of Szechuan and Hunan pepper and black bean hot dishes. I quite liked the old house, and returned late last week to see what the newly imagined kitchen held in store.\n\nFrom our exploration of the two dishes we ordered, it would appear Bai Wei (many tastes) has it going on.  Their takes on crispy spicy chicken and cumin lamb dry pot were excellent. The chicken was loaded with red Szechuan peppers and small morsels of deep fried chicken. Enough to give our tongues a sincere capcesin workout and loosen our sinuses; stopping just short of bringing on tears. Completely addictive. The lamb, tender in a mix of chopped onion and more peppers and overwhelmed with a dusting of coarse cumin seed. Delicious. About as good as the best Szechuanese bowls I've found in the USA.\n\nThe only downside was the continuing attempt by the staff at up selling our order. We were repeatedly asked about appetizers, drinks and rice - even after we declined multiple times. Sure, they want more money per customer, but it became excessive and annoying. \n\nBut for that weird dynamic, we thoroughly enjoyed the meal.

The front of the house belongs to Tony, who has been the sole (soul) server, busser, furniture mover for the past five years, and he has it down to a graceful science. Impressive.\n\nThe kitchen isn't fast, sending out one dish at a time as it is finished rather than bringing everything at once, but that is the style in most of Asia. Yet, once they arrive at the table they demand attention. They are beautiful to behold and distinctively delicious. \n\nWe apped on fried calamari. Big pieces, deep fried but not oily, with a nice spicy red amber dipping sauce. Very good. The lemongrass chicken was a huge plate with celery, onion, green pepper and a hot curry lemongrass sauce. Excellent! Finally, we got to work on a pumpkin papaya vegetarian soup that offset the heat with a mild sweetness. Next time I promise to remember the Cambodian names of these wonderful dishes. \n\nThe cooking here is a close cousin to Thai and Viet style, but with a few other spices indigenous to that part of Southeast Asia, and a tip of the hat to India and Burma as well. \n\nOn this hot day the air conditioning was inadequate, and with the door open to help circulation the flies came in to enjoy their own meals. They were the only reason Khmer Kitchen did not make 5 Stars on this visit, although their buzzing did add to the authenticity.",

    "text": "I'm here to check out the new Wendy's breakfast menu that recently came online. They appear to be in direct competition with the morning offerings from McDonald's, Burger King and Chik Fil-A, at least in this neck of the Northeastern woods. \n\nAs an aside I will note that the facility looks recently refurbished, because the old complaints about a run down enterprise is no longer true. The place looks modern and clean (w the exception of the men's room, which is another story). \n\nI went with a sausage, egg & cheese biscuit combo, which included roasted potato wedges and fresh brewed coffee. It was immediately noticed that their sausage and biscuit retain the signature square shape, but appear smaller than their opposite numbers at the other joints. Regardless, the taste and texture of the sandwich were on target, with flakey, buttery biscuit and good flavored patty. The taters were a solid contributor with pleasant crispness and seasoning. The coffee was brewed for me and it was good and strong. At under $6 for the meal, it was a decent value. \n\nHow does the sammy compare? Glad you asked. \n\nTo my tastebuds and eyesight, it was palpably smaller than Mickey's, but perhaps providing a better biscuit and sausage flavor. Not by much, but still winning by a nose. It is definitely a superior product to that sold by B. K, but fell short of the excellent sandwich prepared by Chik Fil-A. Those guys really have the right stuff from top to bottom when it comes to stuffed biscuits. They are both larger and far more enjoyable. \n\nSo, there you have it. If absolute dominance is what you strive for, Chik Fil-A is your go to. However, if you can't find one nearby, choose Wendy's, McD's or B.B. King in that order if you want to sing the Breakfast Blues.",

I saw the reviews and could not visualize what the joint was all about - perhaps, a little space between the Parts Department and the Waiting Area? \n\nWrong!\n\nIt is a fairly large, totally caf\u00e9-like experience in the back of the service building; right next to the large and comfortable waiting zone, and sharing wall space with the \"Theater,\" (another surprising variant in this auto complex).  The refrigerated display has a load of deli materials, and the walls were large format black & white ceramic tiles.  The Dude running the show was all hatted-up and super friendly.  He must be accustomed to people wandering in and needing a short explanation about what was going on.  He gave me the nickel tour, and I ordered a Sausage, Egg & Cheese Sandwich on Croissant.  \n\nNo sweat.  He called my name a few minutes later and I went to pick up his handiwork.  It was an excellent sandwich on a fresh decent French airy, flakey crescent roll.  Darn good! And, the coffee was free to all who eat there or simply wait patiently for their chariots to be ready.  \n\nFresh ingredients all around. Scratch preparation.  Home baked bagels and other loaves.  \n\nI may never drive a Toyota or Scion, but I was impressed with the marketing savvy and foresight of the folks who put this place together.  Take A Taste is worth the search and discovery.  \n\nWho knows, offer a test drive along with breakfast, and they might move their floor plan up the scale. \n\nHow about a vape shop next to the theater?",

It appeared to be the end of an iconic local institution that had been around, while changing hands, for nearly half a century.  Progress to some.  Loss of culture to others. \n\nThe \"best laid plans...sometimes go astray...\", and when the plans for the medical facility shrunk to a smaller piece of the strip mall, this corner was not included.  All the fixtures remained intact, and a new business bloomed out of the ashes of the old. Ron now runs the operation, and at first blush, the new order of things feels much like the former enterprise.  The counter and tables are the same.  The grill and coffee brew where they sat before.  The menu has been updated, but the kitchen still puts out very good breakfasts (and lunches).  \n\nMy French Toast was done right.  The standard two slices were dipped in an egg/vanilla/cinnamon mix, and grilled expertly with caramelized edges.  The taste was what I wanted, and I appreciated that the \"small stack\" was now the main size for the plate.  A melt of butter; and splash of syrup, and I was a happy man.  The New England Roast Bunn drip java was hot, fresh and repeatedly refilled by Ron as he entertained the troops.  \n\n232 Corner Caf\u00e9 is a victory for the community.

Bread and cheese becomes delicious fast casual cuisine. Born in New York, the brainchild of a twenty something selling hot sammies from a window operation, it now extends as far west as Minnesota. The Newtown store is the second in PA; the first in King of Prussia Mall. \n\nI caught it on its first day. It seemed the entire staff was on hand to help out. They wore black T's with the Melt Shop logo on the back, and ball caps similarly adorned. The place was crowded with assorted families and kids just out of Council Rock North's last week of school. The music system played on a rock loop that made for a very noisy atmosphere that was unnecessary given that it just interfered with conversation and made ordering a shouting contest. \n\nJust turn off the sound system, please! \n\nThe food was very good. I went with the Maple Bacon Grilled Cheese (maple cured thick bacon, cheddar/American slices) within decent bread slices, and Shop Tots (tater tots sprinkled with grated cheese and mild spices). Plenty of chewy flavor inside the hot grilled pain, and well deep fried crisped tots. Liked them both alot. Drank a bottle of their signature water from GIVN, an outfit that brings clean H2O to communities in need. \n\nPrices add up quickly, so if you want a shake with that, lunch reaches $15 in a hurry. \n\nMelt Shop also does variations with fried chicken and burgers, both of which looked good on other tables. Will make it back to check them out. I'll give them a while to figure things out first.\n\nShout out to Davide, one of the managers, with whom I had an informative discussion about the store.",

Hong Kong Star Noodle House is a traditional looking Asian dining room with mahogany stained furniture and considerable menu primarily of Cantonese cuisine, and a tip of the cap to Szechuan and Thai tastes. But, it calls itself a noodle house and that was what I was there for. I really like chow fun, and they say on their Yelp page that it is done very well in their kitchen. A bowl of Hot & Sour Soup was my introduction on this cool windy afternoon, to be followed by Beef Chow Fun. \n\nFirst positive was the presentation of the soup. Rather than being served in a standard round bowl, it arrived in an oblong dish carried atop a white plate. It made it look voluminous with a rich ochre luster. It was full of mushrooms, strips of soft tofu and sprouts. The flavor was perfectly balanced between the vinegar and sesame oil. The textures mixed well between the crunchy sprouts, medium dense mushrooms and silky tofu. It was delectible. \n\nNext came the semi broad noodles and brown sauce of the chow fun. The thin sliced beef was very tender and had been grilled expertly. The noodles, onion and sprouts were in good proportion and the brown sauce both mildly spicy as requested, yet still subtly sweet as per the original recipe. Liked it very much, but it was too much to finish, and I took the rest home for the family. \n\nService was prompt and friendly. My tea mug and water glass were refilled as needed by the woman who appeared to be a manager/owner of the establishment. \n\nHong Kong Star Noodle House impressed me with its close proximation of a old school Chinese restaurant and the quality of its kitchen.

There are acres of areas with large trees and green lawns for your selection. \n\nWhile much smaller and more tame than Tyler State Park a few miles away, Core Creek Park is a very good facility for bringing people close to nature.

The choices were much broader than just traditional spicy beef base and thin cuts of steak, tendon, meatballs, etc. The Chicken Lemongrass Dumplings were plentiful and very good, even though the lemongrass flavor was not pronounced. The complexity of the stock could have been more subtle as well, but with the addition of jalapeno slices, Thai basil and squeezed lime wedges, it was a solid enjoyable slurp. The nest of thin rice noodles beneath the surface were tender and held the broth well as I sucked them up through whistled lips.\n\nBANH MI - Excellent sandwich on very good french demi baguette, stuffed with lots of roast pork, cucumber, carrot and daikon strips with sprigs of cilantro across the top. It was a solid bite and chew, made better with a light touch of combined sriracha and hoisin for extra punch and smooth smokey sweetness. Definitely, one of the better banh mi's I've enjoyed in the past few years in Philly. \n\nPho Nam Giang has a real chance to succeed if it maintains its standards and spends a little more time enriching its base beef and chicken stock. It uses quality ingredients and keeps its facility clean. There isn't much competition nearby, so with effort and good fortune their road is clear ahead.",

The kernals were plump and firm, making for an engaging cool salad-like dish that showed me a new way to enjoy corn off the cob. The Flautas were three homemade tortillas stuffed with excellent ground chicken, spices and cheese, cut in half and served in a star pattern, topped with crema and guacamole. This way, it became finger food, holding shape and contents from presentation to mouth. They were hot, crisp and delicious. \n\nAn interesting aspect of Don Panchito's is that it has a halal kitchen. Before going, I really couldn't imagine how that looked in reality. Turned out that many of the other customers there were in a party that was partially Muslim.

The Scallopini was thin, tender with rich savory red gravy. The sides were pedestrian with lifeless stringbeans and cool french fries. My cup of Chicken Noodle Soup was a pot bottom bowl of too salty bouillon. We weren't there for those little plates anyway. We did enjoy the Caprese Salad appetizer, with soft Buffalo mozza, basil and decent off season tomatoes. \n\nWith the wine and tip, we still walked out for under $60. So while a little inconsistent in execution, we were still very satisfied with the experience. It was the romantic and memorable celebration we hoped for. \n\n3.5 STARS",

With February weather reaching 80 last week, climate change now makes ice cream an all year delight. \n\nUncle Dave's is located in the main store on Shady Brook Farm off Stony Brook Road and the Newtown Bypass. They offer an interesting selection of their ice cream with the ability to accessorize with sprinkles, fudge, caramel, etc. Prices are about right for the competition. Under $4 for the \"Kids\" size; $5 for the \"Medium,\" and $7 for the \"Large.\" In my experience, that Kids size with three scoops of up to three of your favorite flavors was enough. Don't let the description of \"Kids\" deter you from getting only what you can lick in one serving. \n\nI went with two scoops of butter pecan and one scoop of the seasonal pumpkin. They were both creamy and tasted as they should. Not too sweet, not under-flavored. Both were pretty much what I expected. My friends and their young kids opted for more varieties, including cappuccino, strawberry and peanut butter with a side of peanut butter sauce.  They were all happy with their choices. \n\nWas it the best ice cream in greater Newtown? That's a matter of personal preference.  But, given all the alternatives, it represented Dave's well.  Their offerings were more standard that some other parlors, so if exotic and romantic taste is your thing, you might find this place a little uninspired.  For you folks, OhWowCow in Wrightstown is the only way to go. Of course, it also costs more for premium. \n\nLick on!",

This building is right in the center of town and looks to have been a bank in the past.  It is mostly takeout, but there are a few tables (mostly taken up by the owners' kids) for the brave souls who prefer to eat while the food is hot.  \n\nThe Sesame Chicken was above average.  Although the amount was somewhat less than given in most other Chinois houses, the breading was not overly thick, and the sauce was actually pretty good.  The Fried Rice was full of pork, peas and a few other veggie pieces.  I liked the dish. \n\nMost appreciated was the curtsy to hospitality provided by the real plate on which the meal sat.  It was a pleasant touch to get away from serving in-house customers as if they were taking lunch with them.  I don't like eating out of Styrofoam when seated in the restaurant.  The small extra cost of washing a few dishes is nothing compared to the sense that the other places really don't want you around.  The front of the house woman was friendly and engaging as she watched over her kids and the shop.  \n\nWhile Hong Kong Restaurant is still a Sino/American house with standard menu, their effort to provide a welcoming touch to their operation goes a long way.",

This outlet on DeKalb Pike in Blue Bell, PA, can stock your pantry, fridge and medicine cabinet with almost everything you need, even if not everything you yearn for. \n\nWe stopped in recently while in the area for hair styling, hoping to pick up a few things there rather than drive the 30 minutes back home and then stop at our local Giant, when we were hungrier and didn't feel like making that detour closer to dinner. Actually newer than our regular shop, and a touch larger, we discovered that its layout was different than we were used to, and thus slower to cruise through as we searched for our needs. \n\nThe space was clean, with special attention given to their extensive salad bar and back of the shop deli/bakery and the organic section of their their produce department. \n\nFound what we needed in the personal care aisle and bakery, and slid through checkout in a minute. Considered grabbing a roast chicken, but there were not available at the moment. Will probably get that on the next visit to Costco.",

Arriving just as it opened at 11:30, I walked into an empty dining room and was greeted by a friendly Asian woman who welcomed me and confirmed I could dine outside on their umbrellaed patio. Seemed like the safer way to go in this renewed age of raging Delta Covid. \n\nI went with faves, Tom Kha Soup and Drunken Noodles (veggie), 'Thai Spicy'. They threw in a sushi orange ginger dressing salad, which was a surprise. The Tom Kha was excellent, with plenty of fresh mushrooms, sliced chicken, carrots, onion, coconut milk and lemongrass for kicks. Loved each and every slurp. The Drunken was a large plate with extra wide noodles and lots of colorful veggies.\n\n It also came with plenty of cubed tofu pan sauteed to a near burnt finish. The heat was there, although not the conflagration desired. The taste of the overdone tofu while subtle, was enough to through the flavor of the dish slightly off. So, while it was still recognizable, it could have been much better with a more deft hand holding the pan. \n\nBhan Thai is a reasonable facsimile of a genuine attractive Thai restaurant, but candor requires referencing that better can be found in and around Philly, Central Jersey, and closer to home. \n\n3.75 STARS.",

    "text": "Thai Orchid of Blue Bell is a beautifully appointed Siamese restaurant on DeKalb Pike in the wonderfully named town of Blue Bell, PA. It is one of those places where the environment is so rich in southeast Asian colors, textures and artistry, that it is possible to eat the atmosphere. From woodcuts to tapestry the space is relaxed and mellow enough to have you believing you've stepped into a palace in Chiangmai. \n\nI was there for late lunch after a meeting in Norristown. The shop sits in a strip center, the last door on the far right. Don't be put off by that or you'll miss all the magic. There was only one other customer dining when I arrived and was taken to a table on a raised platform that held most of the tables. The menu was full of Thai delights, and lunch combo specials that included soup, appetizer and main entree, for around $10 and change. That seemed the way to go to sample a few things and get more bang for the buck. I went with the Thai Ravioli Soup (wonton), Veggie Roll and Drunken Noodles. \n\nBelieve me, it was a huge amount of food. The soup was vegetable based broth with fancy goldfish wonton filled with ground shrimp and chicken. It had a mild sesame oil flavor and tasted fresh and pleasing. The roll was deep fried with a filling of mixed vegetables, glass noodles and a small dish of sweet & sour dipping sauce. It was good, but a tad over fried.\n\n The drunken noodle was a large plate full of medium width noodles (not jumbo), loaded with chunky onions, bell peppers, green beans, fresh basil, thin sliced beef and moderately hot Thai spices. I asked for it to be very chilified, but it was still pretty tame. It seems that regardless of what you ask for on the heat scale, it is interpreted as only moderately spicy. How you actually get the \"Very spicy yet Bearable,\" fire level is beyond me. Here, it cost them a star for failing to honor my clear direction. \n\nAside from the width of the noodles and the lack of burn, this was a very satisfying meal, and enough to keep me sated for the rest of the day. The decor and food together make Thai Orchid of Blue Bell a worthy stop for quality exotic cuisine. It would be even better if they paid closer attention to what was being requested.",

For the past few weeks I have found myself searching for deli or sandwich shop that does chopped tuna the way I like it - with mayo, celery, light black pepper and finished with hot and sweet pickled peppers. I can go for years without even thinking of it, but every once in a while I just gotta have some.\n\nSlack's Hoagie Shack is a regional chain in these parts. They have a large menu of everything that can be stuffed into a torpedo roll and eaten. They happen to do tuna particularly well. They seem to grind it, more than chop it, making for a smooth, plyably, dense consistency, that hangs together well in a sandwich, and accepts additional condiments easily. It is not overly moist, so it is not given to slipping out the back door, and keeps it's shape until bitten. \n\nOne hoagie is enough for two meals for me, as the standard length is about 12 inches. Their bread is pretty good, but mine may have been past its prime, as it seemed ein bissel dry. In the Trenton area, with so many Italian bakeries, this is almost inexcusable. Fix this, and 5 Stars await.\n\nService was excellent, with easy ordering by phone, and smiling takeout once at the shop. Facility was also immaculate.",

Yet, I found myself in JC Penny in the Oxford Valley Mall recently to exchange shoes that had been purchased online, but arrived the wrong size.  While that might warrant a negative review on its own, the way the folks in the store handled the problem was worthy of praise. \n\nWe came to the shoe department hoping to find the exact shoe we wanted, but their inventory was rather limited.  When we explained to the manager who happened to be at the register what was going on, she promptly accepted our explanation and the shoes and was able to credit our card immediately.  Beyond that, she ordered the shoes we wanted directly at the register, for free delivery within three days.  \n\nSure enough, UPS dropped off the right shoes to our front porch three days later.  They made us happy to have dealt with them.  Even though it would have been better had the right shoes arrived the first time, the way the fix was dealt with was friendly, apologetic and efficient.  And, they threw in an extra $5 discount for our troubles. \n\nI may be the victim of low expectations, but I was pleased by the overall experience. Mistakes can be made by anyone.  It is how they are remedied that tells the tale. \n\nThis experience made me a fan of JC Penny.",

Lizhi Health Spa is operated in the Chinese tradition, with lots of heavy hands, forearms, elbows, and back walking if a \"strong\" massage is what you want.  \n\nI did, and they did.  I found myself breathing in unison with my masseuse's work, because the pressure was so intense at times, that inhaling was not an option.  Joints and tense muscles began to pop and relax as the effort continued.  Even my left shoulder, injured thirty years ago, began to unwind as a sharp elbow found its target.  After torso and limbs addressed this way, she returned to my arms and legs and began to stretch them beyond their normal range to increase their motion and reduce restrictions.  My legs were torqued as she leaned her body weight into it.  My lower back begrudgingly responded, and for the first time in years, the sense of tingling in my feet stopped for the rest of the day.  \n\nAll in all, an impressive display of Tui-Na.  I ended up on the table for two hours, and each minute was intensely worth it.  At $100 for 120 minutes, the price was fair for all the heavy lifting this diminutive woman undertook.  She had surprising strength and excellent technique.  My tip was commensurate with her quality work.\n\nWill certainly return as needed.  \n\nCash Only.",

    "text": "Returned to Aldo's for dinner for the first time in more than a decade. At one time it had been a regular stop in my rotation when I lived right across Buck Road in Holland, PA. It was good to be back. \n\nThe menu offered a broad swatch of Italian cuisine, mostly of the red sauce variety, but with enough variation to keep it interesting. We went with the Calamari appetizer, and entrees of Veal Parmesan and Chicken Francais, both with sides of pasta, minestrone soup and side salad. We were quite happy with our meals. \n\nThey started off on an off note with a luke warm minestrone that had not been sufficiently reheated, nor tested. The early salad was satisfactory, if less than imaginative. Things improved from there. The Calamari was perfectly prepared with tender squid wrapped in a tasty bread crumb dredge and a thick marinara dipping sauce. The veal was delicious with two thin filets, breaded and pan fried in extra virgin just right to maximize its delicate texture and finished with melted mozza and more chunky red gravy. The three Francaised chicken breast medallions were pan sauteed in butter, lemon and white wine. They were fork cuttable and the interplay of the lemon and wine played tartly and smartly on the tongue. We used the crusty bread to sop up as much of the reduction as possible. My request for the pasta side bowl to be penne aglio olio rather than more tomato sauce was a good call because I loved the well browned garlic and black pepper mix. \n\nAldo still does a solid traditional Italian American dinner in an attractive dining room. It was nice to know that for the most part they hadn't lost their touch.",

You may find the house a bit dirty in the corners, and in need of some love and care, but the kitchen knows what it is doing.  \n\nWhen I walked in the other night looking for a modest dinner, I was met with a warm smile and greeting from the woman behind the high cashier's counter.  I asked if they were still serving, and was advised I could sit anywhere and be served hot food until late into the night.  The menu was full of most of the usual suspects to be found in a Roman bistro, excepts perhaps for the first Specialty Pizza, the Mexican.  I asked about their Sausage, Pepper & Onion Sandwich and was told it was one of her favorites.  Good enough for me.\n\nWhat seemed like 5 minutes later, out of the kitchen walked the chef holding a white ceramic plate with my dinner.  Fast!  First look was of a split Sweet Italian Sausage well grilled and a pile of Saut\u00e9ed Onions and Green Peppers overflowing the rim of the torpedo roll.  They may have saved a few bucks on the bread, which was sort of non-descript, but the innards were hot, tasty and a very good representation of the genre.  No need for ketchup or other additional condiments.  This was a heavy hitter with strong accent.  I liked it a lot, although it would have been even better with Green Frying Peppers in place of the generic greens.  \n\nAnd, at a cost of under $6 for this creation, it made little dent in my wallet.  \n\nI will be back to try the pizza and other goodies at Anthony IV, as this place is close to the best pizza joint I have sampled in the Morrisville area.  Between the down/dirty ambiance, friendly service, and good food, it checks off most of my boxes.\n\nSo nice to be pleasantly surprised.",

I think of it as a historic artifact from the days when paper and ink were required to publish and market books.

    "text": "This review reflects only on the Xiao Long Bao, Beef Scallion Pancakes, Crispy Salted Chicken and Dam Dam (sic?) Noodles, all of which are on the Dim Sum Appetizers menu.  \n\nWe chose Shanghai 1 specifically for their reputation for good XLB as described by many Yelpers.  The shop is another of those long narrow houses with tables running along the north wall all the way to the restroom.  It is attractive enough with artificial flowers on each table and modern wall hangings.  The service is fast and friendly, especially if Mandarin is spoken in the exchange.  \n\nWe found the Soup Dumplings (XLB) to be very good.  The skin was thin, the soup hot and savory, and the ground pork filling, soft and tasty.  The table rocket with the dumpling vinegar was a great tool for squirting into the open pouch once the top knot was bitten off to suck out the broth.  We liked them so much, we ordered another bamboo steamer of 6 after finishing everything else.  \n\nThe Beef Scallion Pancake was likewise very enjoyable.  I did not find it overly oily given it was fried in that scalding fluid, and the beef within was tender and brought to sweet life with the Hoisin Sauce in which it had been prepared.  The Crispy Salted Chicken was their take on the fried chicken craze.  The chicken was tender, but the breading a might over-fried to a too-dark brown.  The pieces were very small and included many droplets of plain dough without any meat within.  While the taste was okay, the overall impression was underwhelming.   \n\nBoth the XLB and Pancakes were winners, while the Crispy Fried Chicken left something to be desired. I leave it to others to discuss the relative merits of the XLB created by the other shops known for this Shanghai delicacy, Dim Sum Garden and Sakura Mandarin.  If we had stopped with the first three dishes all would have been quite content.  Our son was still hungry and wanted some noodles.  He ordered the Dam Dam Noodles with Chili Sauce hoping to top off his meal with some spicy carbs.  At 19, he can afford to do that.  Unfortunately, he was disappointed with this dish.  He complained that it was tasteless and bland.  He left half of it in the bowl and declined to take the rest home. Perhaps, we should have known given the exotic spelling of the dish.  \n\nWe will stick with the Xiao Long Bao and Scallion Pancakes on future visits.",

It too, is modern and uniquely different from most of the other ethnic houses in this community.  If you want a break from Pho and Broken Rice (or even if you don't), but desire creativity and great distinctive flavor, this is your destination of choice.  \n\nI had read the reviews, but was still very pleasantly surprised by the attention to comfort and privacy afforded here.  Booths with high back benches separating us from our dining neighbors.  Dark woody tones with high ceilings and subdued lighting. Glass vases, mirrors behind the bar, and extended front wall to let an image of the city enter, but keep us hidden within.  A place for a date. \n\nWe ordered #s 9 and 70 - Pineapple Salad appetizer and Short Ribs roasted in a clay pot.  Both were exceptional.  The App came in a hollowed out half Pineapple, loaded with fresh Fruit, raw Calamari, spicy Shrimp, and assorted sidekick Veggies, all held together with a Lime and Pineapple Juice base with an assist from a good Fish Sauce. It was delicious. It wasn't Cerviche, but suggested that style.  When the solids were consumed, we asked for spoons so we could drink the sauce remaining in the bottom of the pineapple.  I could have had that for a cocktail if mixed with a little light rum. \n\nThe Short Ribs had been torched to a dark burn, so that everything else in the clay pot had been caramelized into a thick glazy gravy that was hot with a hint of sweet.  The meat was easily liberated from the bone and also captured that intense taste.  We loved it.  \n\nIf there was a weakness it came from the bar that prepared the Mai Tai we requested.  I envisioned a Trader Vic's drink, full of orange, pineapple and lime juice, two rums, coconut liquor, and Grenadine.  Aside from a squirt of lime and a pour of Grenadine and Light Rum, the other ingredients were absent, making for a thin drink lacking its soul.  Next time, we skip the drinks. \n\nOtherwise, this was a top notch meal.  It was a great alternative to the usual stops on Philly-Saigon-Hanoi dinner train.",

Don't know, but when mixed with sausage, potato, onion, peppers, all wrapped up in an fresh egg case, they become an amazing sensory explosion.  \nTrenton may have seen better days (we have been waiting for its resurgence since it was \"Americas Town\" in the 60's), but Pat's carries on.\nDiners are only partially about the food, and the rest about the concept, design, and lustful loyalty they inspire. \nPat's is a worthy contender for the Urban Diner List on Yelp* (If there is one). \nGive it a try. \nSit at the counter and watch professionals do their thing. Sit at a window and see a worldview that captures the past-its-prime city, the capital of the Garden State, remind you that... We Are Still Here.",

    "text": "The Big Easy used to be Maxine's back in the day.  In those wild and wooly days of yesteryear, I was bartending around the corner, and would sometimes stop in here on an off night or after hours for a few drinks and/or dances.  The layout looks the same - like the inside of a ship.  Two levels of seating in an oval dining room.  Large dance floor still holding down the main deck.  \n\nI stopped in for breakfast earlier this week.  The door was propped open and I wasn't certain they were doing morning business.  They were. I was greeted by a warm smiling young woman who walked me into the smaller barroom, where I chose a table close by the front windows.  They were still setting/cleaning up, but made me feel quite welcome.  \n\nThis kitchen is Halal, so I ordered a Beef Bacon, Egg and Cheese on an Whole Wheat Roll.  As you can see from the photo, the sandwich was big and loaded.  I enjoyed every bite.  The coffee was fresh brewed after I asked for some, and it was very tasty. I think that was Chicory mixed in as a nod to Caf\u00e9 du Monde in NOLA.  \n\nThis is a great place for an early morning meeting or just a quiet solitary breakfast.  It was fun to be back in the old joint, and to see it was being so well cared for.  \n\nFor downtown Trenton, this is a definite gem.",

    "text": "It took me two tries to find the front door of Mauceri Pizza.  It has combined two storefronts.  The one to the right lets you in, while the door on the left is permanently closed on the dining room side of the establishment.  It is not immediately apparent that this is now one operation, so take this tip to find your way.  It is worth your while to come inside. \n\nFirst glance, it still looks like an Italian pizza shop with a couple of pies on display, and large ovens toward the back.  It is rather hot in there on a humid Judy day, but the now-glass wall between the two rooms also insulates the strong air conditioning in the dining room.  As there was no one else eating when I arrived, I sought permission to enter and have lunch.  No problem.  Although a Salvadoran house, most there spoke English well enough to understand each other.  The room is rather large with ample tables for a nice dinner crowd.  \n\nThe menu is a cross between Italian and Salvadoran cuisine.  All the usual suspects on the Roman side, and substantial offerings in Spanish, as well.  One of their specialties was Chili Rellenos, one of my favorite Central American dishes, and I went for it.  What followed was a parade of plates from Chips and Salsa, to Pickled Peppers, Tortillas, and a huge platter with the Rellenos, Rice and Salad.  The stuffed chili pepper covered in egg and drowned in spicy red sauce, was about the best I had ever eaten.  The stuffing seemed to be a combination of ground meat, cheese, onion and more pepper.  It was filling and delicious. I will never know how they expected one man to eat that much.  I barely touched the tortillas and the rice.  My cold Jicaima Juice was a rich dark cranberry color, sweet and refreshing. \n\nThe only question that arose was the actual price for my meal.  The hand out flyer listed the dish at $7., while the hard menu said it was $8.  I was charged $9. They should work on getting some consistency in pricing to avoid any chance someone might think they were trying to take advantage of a gringo.  Yet, even at the highest price, it was still a deal. I said nothing and let the confusion slide. \n\nThis piece of Liberty Street is attempting to come back to life after a rough couple of decades.  There are now a few restaurants and shops on the street and a new CVS down the block.  With a little luck, they will all do well.",

    "text": "Once upon a time, there was a Jersey Diner on Olden Avenue called The Extension Diner.  It had good food, but was old and tired. A reviewer stopped in for breakfast once in a while on his way to court.  He loved the counter service, the humongous muffins displayed in front of him, and the bottomless cup of coffee from the Cecilware perk antique coffee maker.  When he semi-retired, and stopped visiting \"The Ex,\" the diner was so sad, it decided to close its doors. \n\nTwo guys named Peter came along.  They saw the bathetic eatery and its promise.  They decided to buy it, modernize it, and reopen with a fresh face, new menu, and the old Cecilware coffee maker.  \n\nEventually, the reviewer came out of retirement, strapped on his suit and long sword, and returned to slaying dragons.  Driving down Olden Avenue he beheld the new Two Peters Diner where the old Extension used to be, and stopped in to see what it was about.  Much to his amazement the new joint was beautiful.  Everything inside was new, spacious, bright and cheerful.  The maidens were just as friendly and courteous as he remembered; the Cecilware coffee just a wonderfully dark and rich.  \n\nHalf the long counter was gone, replaced by a large cake/pie display.  Still, he found a spinner and slid onto it.  As in past ages the muffins were directly in front of him as if time had not moved them from their appointed place.  They were still very large, with pillow tops and trim paper bases.  \n\nHad to have one.  Cranberry it was. \n\nToasted, it was still soft with a moistness that bespoke freshness.  The texture was dense, compressing pleasantly when chewed, and slowly releasing its sweetness, and mild acidic cranberry charm.  It crumbled slightly on the plate, but was easily captured with the tines of the fork. With Cecil coffee, it was an ample breakfast. \n\nTwo Peters is a worthy successor to the old \"Ex.\"  In many ways a vast improvement.  This knight errant will make it a regular stop on his quest to slay the firebreathers.",

An old man's bar? A beer bar?  A good happy hour bar?  A foodie bar?  The answers are simple. Yes. \n\nAny really good hangout bar is all things to all people.  That's what makes them fun and special.  Whoever you are; whatever you do; whatever you want; regardless of time; The Firkin delivers.  It allows you to feel at home, and make it your own.  I've only been here a couple of times, once for lunch and another for happy hour after work, and although the experience of each visit was different, the constant was an upbeat vibe with friendly attractive staff, and drinks, menu and activities that were entertaining, tasty and fairly priced.  Most important - the crowd mixes well together.  Labels are unnecessary and soon forgotten. Just have fun.  \n\nThe space is surprisingly large, and well placed mirrors make it seem even bigger.  The dark tones make it seem older than it is and adds to the atmospherics.  The bar is big enough for bellyups, and the bar menu is sufficiently diverse to make a few hours on a stool pass quickly.  Decent beer choices for the craft people, and those who are happy with their Buds.  The kitchen turns out interesting plates of nachos, flatbreads, sammys, burgers, soups, salads, and more.  Your tastebuds will be satisfied. \n\nI have sampled several of the above while sitting at the bar at happy hour, and been pleasantly surprised.  Cheesesteak Nachos!? Are you kidding me?  Fun comfort food at its best.  Stuffed Chicken Sammy on a fresh roll with a load of mushrooms, cheese and honey mustard sauce - very good.  Burgers; thick and way above average.  \n\nYeah! The Firkin Tavern is a sleeper and a keeper, regardless of what part of the elephant you touch.",

Amazing!\n\nAs a kid growing up in a big city, I first experienced bowling in a tiny, 8 lane facility on the second floor of an old factory that had been adaptively reused into a recreation zone.   There was a tire store downstairs, and a candy store on the corner.  Games were 3 for a buck, and shoe rental another two bits.  It was great fun for my buds and me.  \n\nBrunswick Zone is a different animal entirely.  Bowling is not even mentioned in the name nor signage.  Yet, there are 48 lanes here, and the distant thunder of ball striking pin is buffered by the sounds of laser tag, pool, large bar/restaurant, and arcade with pinball wizards running up the score.  It has become full menu fun.  The cost is higher for all these options, but really still a decent value. \n\nI went down to Feasterville to pick up number one son from an afternoon/early evening of Brunswick Zone entertainment.  Walking through the sliding doors I felt like this was another Home Depot, Cabellas moment - a huge warehouse hanger of a building jammed with every group game imaginable.  Overwhelming sounds and lights. I was preparing to head for the large bar to wait until the young man emerged from laser tag or a final few frames of a bowling tournament, but found him quickly in front of the laser tag desk.  \n\nI hope he has another invite to go there to play so I can check everything out in more detail.  If not, I will have to take him there myself.  \n\nI hear my childhood calling.",

It feels like a luncheonette with small booths, tables, and a very friendly \"Coach\" handling the orders and register.  High school banners on the walls and a HDTV tuned to ESPN. Local kids working the grills.  Feels familiar and timeless.\n\nThe menu is on a digital board (a bit incongruously).  As soon as I saw the juxtaposition of two of my favorite words, \"burger and jalapenos,\" I knew where I was heading.

The location is very convenient to the courthouses, and unlike the hilltop, there is no parking issue down here.  \n\nThe space is large and bright, and looks the same as most Paneras.  The service was fine, although the ordering and delivery take place at opposite ends of the long half wall that separates the work from dining areas.  There were plenty of free tables at 8:00 am and I was very comfortable occupying a booth by myself.  \n\nI had a basic breakfast of Quinoa Steel Cut Oatmeal, which came with sliced Strawberries, Walnut and Brown Sugar.  It was thick and tasty.  Glad it was a small bowl.  The Toasted Everything Bagel was fresh and held the Veggie Spread well.  With coffee, the meal was under $10.  No problem there.  \n\nI have visited enough Paneras around the country to know that while they all look the same, they do not all act the same.  The Doylestown facility did not seem to have any problem with attitude, nor accuracy, although other Yelpers seem to have had different experiences.  \n\nGiven the overall quality of the experience and the ease of parking, this Panera gets my vote for the optimal breakfast on a busy morning in the downtown area.",

I just walk over for an hour, have a beer, martini or margarita and a nibble of pretty good bar food specials, and make my way home.  It is also perfect for pre/post meeting meetings to prep/rehash the issue of the moment.  I usually find my buds upstairs in a cluster, but we have been known to find a corner downstairs to stand around in as we strategize or just blow off steam.  \n\nThe alcohol is what swings this dark horse, but the kitchen does turn out some quality dishes.  The wings, dumplings, Mexi/Texi tapas, and even the burgers are done well, though their concepts may be different than you have experienced elsewhere.  \n\nToo, you gotta like the overall atmosphere of the old place.  The renovations have not detracted from the historical marker that this tavern has been over many many years.  After one drink it is easy to imagine the Continental Army marching down State Street on its way to Washington Crossing.  After two drinks you realize that there are Tory sympathizers in the bar.  After three, the Sons of Liberty are ready to throw them out into the street.  \n\nI have not actually sat down for a full dinner here.  No particular reason other than the circumstances of the day.  The prices are higher than my other favorite watering hole, The Clubhouse, but the differential can be explained by the ambiance and the targeted customers. \n\n Depending on my mood, BHT can be exactly right, particularly if planning the next skirmish in the War of Independence.",

    "text": "My current addiction to fried chicken found me cruising around Morrisville looking for my fix.  Driving along Pennsylvania Avenue after crossing the river on the pay bridge, I spied US Fried Chicken in a strip behind La Villa Italian restaurant.  I pulled into the parking lot, and wove my way closer to their shop. \n\nWalking up to their door I looked again at their overhead sign.  Did it mean United States Fried Chicken, or We Fry Chicken? My curiosity became more intense when I saw that the enterprise was run by a Korean couple. They were friendly, courteous, and as I was the only customer in there when I arrived, willing to do what it took to please me.  \n\nThey didn't have much chicken in the heating bins, so I asked if they would be cooking up some more.  Yes. If I was willing to wait 15 minutes, they would put a load together for the deep fryer.  Are you kidding me? Only 15 for fresh fried chicken?  I would have waited 30 if need be.  So, I watched as they took the chicken from the refrigerator (not freezer), put in into a large aluminum bowl and poured in the flour/spice mix and stirred it up.  A small cloud of orange dust rose from the swirling.  I could smell the pepper and other secret ingredients when they reached me.  Hmmm...\n\nMister US brought the bowl over to the fryer and carefully lowered the breasts and wings into the gurgling oil one piece at a time, while Mrs. US put together the Fried Rice that came with my order.  Other folks came in while I waited, and each was taken care of in turn.  The operation was smooth and they worked very well together as a team.  \n\nWhen the chicken was golden and tested for completion, my take away order was packaged and bagged.  It was heavy from the 2 breasts, 2 wings and the hefty load of rice.  Smelled great, and it remained hot until I started eating it at home.  \n\nThe Breast was plump, moist and almost entirely edible with little bone.  The coating was crisp, crunchy, and had a very satisfying spiciness that was a little hot from whatever chili essence might be in the mix.  The wings were similarly plump and delicious.  The Fried Rice was surprisingly good.  It did not taste stale from sitting around, but was still in its early stages of existence.  \n\nFor the moment, US Fried Chicken has caught my attention and appreciation.  My search for the Southern Fried Grail continues, but at least now I know where I can go to find a fine substitute for the ultimate Fried Chicken.",

The entrance is in the back of the building and is oriented toward the canal, which can easily be seen through the window wall of the restaurant.  \n\nMy first impression was that it was a busy place for lunch, and a very attractive dining room with all the glass bringing in natural light and a pleasant view - even when the world is snow covered.  The Greek/Mediterranean menu is diverse enough to satisfy most palates.  We ordered a Bowl of Chicken Orzo Soup, Chicken Gyro with Fries, and Spanakopita, while sitting at a deuce in the middle of the floor.  We did not feel crowded nor lacking privacy despite the nearly full house.  \n\nThe Chicken Orzo Soup was a bit pricy @ $5. for a cup, but the taste was right on with a lemony aroma and flavor and chunks of white meat chicken and creamy stock.  The Gyro wrapped a warm pita around roasted chicken, tahini sauce, lettuce, and red onion.  Very good mix of texture and flavor and a satisfying meal.  The fries were good, but nothing exceptional.  The Spanakopita for lunch was an approximate 5 inch square of properly backed, philo flakey, feta melty, spinach garlicy tartness.  All quality ingredients.  The overall meal was completely enjoyable, and made me wonder why I hadn't eaten here before. \n\nThe price structure is such that it is hard to get out for less than about $12 per, so Canal Grille might not be your every day stop, yet it certainly presents itself as a classy mellow space to enjoy a special lunch with an important conversation.  \n\nWell done!\n\nUPDATE. JUNE 13, 2017 - Returned to Canal Grille a few weeks ago with officemates for lunch. The place looks the same, which is to say, attractive with its airy lightness and windows facing the canal.  Menu was about the same. Still predominantly Greek. Service professional. \nMy Salate Trio, consisting of a sampling of Sesame Noodles, Pineapple Chicken Salad and  Greek Salad, was pretty on the plate, and tasty going down. Each unique in texture and flavor, and just enough to fill me without feeling stuffed.  The pita was also light and excellent at absorbing the nuances of each salad.  \n\nStill a superior lunch in the heart of Yardley, Pa.",

A lot of effort has been put into refinishing the outside in stone, while retaining the mid-Twentieth Century dark wood tones of the long bar and dining areas.  The place feels cool and comforting, with HDTVs in every corner playing Latin music videos that most of the customers can sing along with.  \n\nMy server, Arlene, was smoothly bilingual as she welcomed me and brought me a menu. A picture of grace and beauty.  The food offerings were diverse, but focused primarily on the native cuisine of this Central American nation.  I ordered the \"Sandwich Pura Vida\" with Chicken, and a fresh Bastida Mora (Raspberry shake).  When it arrived, it was in the form of a Panini, with scorch marks top and bottom, and compressed down with lettuce and tomato showing from the edges.  \n\nAfter squirting on a little mayo from the table rockets, I clamped down for a big bite.  The juicy contents were hot and flavorful, although the chicken was slightly overcooked and dry.  Still, the overall impression was of a zesty, filling torta, well worth the $7 tag.  The accompanying French Fries were crispy and nicely spiced.  The Raspberry frappe was cool, tart, delicious, and made from real berries (not a mix).  \n\nI enjoyed my visit to Pura Vida, and it was obvious that the other clientele felt the same, as most were there engaged in conversation long after their meals were done.  This resto joins a growing community of casas Latinas taking root in the capital city; each distinct, yet providing a broad palette of color and exotic rhythms to the streets of Trenton.",

    "text": "This Acme in the Village of Newtown Shopping Center recently underwent a makeover to bring it into the 21 Century.  The two main improvements were the new beer aisle and Starbucks, both very near the right side entrance to the supermarket, just beyond the bakery.  \n\nThese in house coffee shops are a version of the outlets found in airports around the world. A decent work area for the crew, with smaller units for pastries and light fare, and very limited displays for their branded coffee and accessories. \n\nThe mermaid has been here about six months and they are efficient in their operation.  One early evening this week it was well staffed with a friendly crew ready to serve.  The barista kept her poise as she mixed my Chai Latte. Never missed a beat in our repartee. The others were cleaning up in anticipation of closing within the hour.  \n\nPerhaps, because they see the same customers routinely, but this shop was far better in its customer service than the equivalent business in an airport.  They show that the opportunity to build relationships enhances the overall experience.  No doubt, for both parties. \n\nEven this Starbucks-phobe found this captive distribution point enjoyable.  It even made their drinks taste better somehow. \n\nGood job!",

    "text": "Getting back to basics, all I wanted was the original double patty Elevation Burger, straight up with ketchup, jalapenos, and hot pepper relish. No fries. No shake. No sweet drinks. \n\nThat was exactly what was delivered to my high top several minutes later. It came neatly wrapped in a plain brown paper sleeve. Upon opening, there was copious grease dripping from the wrapper. The chef must have added that after grilling, because the burger itself was no overly wet. \n\nIt tasted great. There must be something to that organic, hormone free, free range cattle from whence the beef puck comes. The texture was soft, and the flavor, excellent. Definitely a step above 5 Dudes, and on par with Shake Shack at a lower price point. Reminded of Burgatory, one of my faves in the Pittsburgh, PA area. Priced right at around $7 for the sandwich. \n\nFries started at $3.50, and shakes, $5. Add those and pretty soon you have an expensive lunch on your hands. Without, the burger justifies itself every time.",

    "text": "We were looking for a solid Polish restaurant to satisfy our craving for pierogis.  Alexander's Caf\u00e9 was the nearest to our location, although not exactly in the neighborhood. We found it after a twisted course mapped by my GPS.  It sits below the train tracks on Park Avenue in Elkins Park, in a nicely renovated early 20th Century building.  Walking in, the impression was of exposed red brick walls and highly polished dark wood floors.  \n\nIt didn't feel Polish, and after sitting at a white tableclothed table and perusing the menu, it clearly wasn't only that.  There were more Italian and American dishes offered, with only a small piece of the list for East European cuisine.  That the solitary server was Asian helped complete the comfortable, yet disjointed, gestalt of the house. \n\nStill, we ordered a mixed plate of pierogis along side the Chicken Parmesan Special, and a bowl of Cream of Broccoli Leek Soup.  We wanted to share everything, and we were provided separate bowls and plates of each dish.  It was a very strong touch of class and customer accommodation (See Photos). \n\nThe Soup was silky smooth and steaming.  The leek announced itself dominant to the broccoli, which was the way I liked it.  Fresh toasted croutons floated on top.  They were well seasoned and lightly crunchy.  The Pierogis were potato/cheese, sauerkraut and beef in unusually soft dough dumpling shell.  Excellent with a saut\u00e9ed onion and chive garnish. We had four apiece; just enough for a co-staring role with the Chicken.  The bird was fresh (never frozen), pan fried in olive oil and breaded lightly.  The red gravy was homemade with a mild spiciness. The mozza was very new, and melted easily, without covering the color and texture beneath.  Quite tasty.  \n\nThe shop was short a server that night, and our man was forced into hard labor to keep up.  He never lost his poise, but the time between courses and receiving our check was longer than necessary due to his need to be in overdrive all evening. Not on him at all, and we showed our appreciation.  Still, management has responsibility to assure service is impeccable if they are to receive highest rank.  \n\nAlexander's Caf\u00e9 is a good place for dinner on a cold night, as long as you understand that it is not completely a Polish house.\n\nStreet parking can be challenging.",

It is the only place I buy my calendar for the new year, and I admit to being amazed and amused by the variety of paperclips available. \n\nIf there is a shortcoming (and the basis for not shouting, \"Woohoo!\") it is that the staffing is meager and there are seldom enough workers on the floor to help out finding things.  \n\nStill, I am very happy to have Staples in Newtown.",

Yelp led me to Violetwood Caf\u00e9, yet another of those quiet gardens hidden from plain sight in a strip commercial center that has seen far better days.\n\nThe caf\u00e9 is brightly painted and staffed by a cadre of black T- shirted servers who have a very positive attitude about their restaurant and seem to enjoy their jobs.  I sat down in a booth toward the back and had a mug of coffee in front of me within a minute. It was fine. The menu had both the popular usual suspects for breakfast, plus a few permanent house specials as well as a daily black board.  \n\nMy Sausage Scramble (I think that was it) was a large mountain of Egg, Italian Sweet Sausage, Onion, Peppers, topped with Provolone.  It was moist, and chunky and fun to eat.  The Rye Toast was a real loaf complete with Caraway Seeds.  \n\nVioletwood Caf\u00e9 is a 4 Star performer, and could easily move up.",

It has a large square bar with tables on the edges, and a couple of large dining rooms. The space is carpeted with heavy curtains, and gives off the sense of at one time being a club to bring business associates or family for traditional boot dining and entertainment. New ownership took over fairly recently, but the place looks the same as before, with the exception of live music in the bar a few nights a week. \n\nWe sat in the bar at a hightop, ordered two drafts (Sam Adams Winterbrew & Stella Artois), and pulled a large Nonna's Margharita Pie, Calamari and bowl of French Onion Soup from the thick menu. While there, the band started playing Eagles covers in the opposite corner of the room. They were pretty good for a Tuesday night, so we hung around longer than normal to catch a few extra tunes. \n\nThe grub was good for bar food. The squid was a touch over deep fried, but still tasted good with their excellent dipping red sauce. It included tentacles, always a plus. The soup was sealed in melted gruyere, had a strong beef stock and a load of soft sweet onions and saturated bread within. Enjoyable. The pizza was a decent rendition of the Italian flag - red sauce, white mozzarella and green basil - on a thin crisp crust. It was good, but not in the pantheon of amazing bar pies found around the capital area.\n\nAll in all, we were quite satisfied with our night at Freddy's, and agreed we would def return to satisfy our  need for Roman cuisine or burgers. For me, it was nice to be back in the bar I spend much time in during my younger days. \n\nFelt just like old times with older people, including me.",

In addition to a utilitarian black brick with exposed steel and large windows, these guys brew up some very tasty and interesting suds, and have a dynamite kitchen.  Three strikes and you win! \n\nSo, we stopped in on a rainy afternoon to celebrate a significant milestone (securing a driver's license), and found a table on the first floor.  The space had a long wall divider separating the bar from the dining area. There was a metal grate stairway to a second floor retreat that might have been a cool place to hang on a crowded, hoppy night.  We ordered a flight of four drafts, and a lunch of their Brussel sprout app., Fiesta Tacos, and Harvest Salad.  The beers were: Puddlers Row ESB, Burn Everything Rye Porter, Glazing Saddles, and Viking Funeral.  They were 4 ounce samples of their extensive custom brew list.  All were distinctly different, some more appealing to my palate than others.  \n\nThe ESB had a strong hoppiness, while the Burn Everything, a dominant bitters flavor.  I enjoyed the Glazing Saddles (were there really local donuts in the fermentation?), and the Viking Funeral, which was extra dark with a honey chocolate taste.  Liked these last two a lot. \n\nThe food surprised me on the up side.  The Brussels were roasted with parmigiana  cheese and pork bellies.  The were scorched and delicious.  I've been trying to make these at home, but never as good as these dudes.  The tacos were loaded with corn, beans, tomato, lettuce, and some other things wrapped in warm tortillas.  Very good.  The salad was full of dried cranberries, walnuts, romaine, gorganzolla and more leafy stuff in an excellent vinaigrette.  More than I could consume.  We took half the salad and a few remaining sprouts home in a neat black box. \n\nIf I was more a beer man, this place although a distance from home, would be a regular stop on the pilsner trail. Make that bourbon and I could be convinced to ride the circuit and tempt the traffic demigods on the PA Pike between Bridgeport and Bucks frequently.\n\nStill, I read that the burgers are exceptional, so at least one more visit is foreseeable.",

    "text": "Taqueria Aguila (Eagle) is really two places in one. \nFirst, it is La Mexicana grocery store, with a great bakery and other standard items for la cocina. Second, it is a taqueria, with hot kitchen on wheels in back grilling up excellent plates of pork, beef and chicken for a variety of menu items from tacos to tortas and full dinners. In fact, the whole operation is turned around, with entrance in the rear leading to the tienda, and a dozen or so tables in back (front) for dining in. There is table service, but most of the trade is cash and carry. \n\nI figured this out recently when I arrived looking for dinner, read the sign on the front (back) door leading me to the rear of the building, where the entrada was, right next to a shiny stainless steel trailer cooking away and scenting the air with all manner of delicious aromas. While they don't have everything listed on their printed menu, they do have the tacos, burritos, quesadillas and various specials available. I was happy to go with two Tacos Al Pastor and fresh Watermelon juice. At $2.99 per taco, and $3.00 for  large glass of refreshing red bebida, I thought the price right, if the meal was up to snuff.\n\nAnd, it was. \n\nThe double layered tortilla rolled taco had plenty of tasty pineapple infused grilled slivers of pork, onion, peppers and crema, with lime wedges and sliced radish as garnish. A little squirt of hot sauce, a dribble of red/green salsa, and I was good to go. They were excellent - hot, crisp and a glorious mouthful to chew with a smile. The watermelon (la sandia), was cool, sweet and so refreshing. Like eating right from the totally absorbed fruit and crushing it in my mouth. Hard not to smile and let some of that delight run down my chin. \n\nYes. This joint is a little divey, but that adds to its authenticity. Mixed furniture thrown together over somewhat unswept floors, just adds to the impression that for the moment you have entered Juarez or Mexicali, and departed the USA without your passport. \n\nI felt great solidarity with our Mexican brethren last weekend. This was the fastest way to travel to their side and join them in common cause.",

So, it is important to keep that in mind when evaluating a rounder experience. \n\nThis became paramount when I stopped by Abington All Star Bagel on Rt. 611.  The shop was small and clean.  The staff, friendly and helpful.  The bagels in the display, real beauties.  I ordered my standard Onion Bagel with butter and Swiss, and took the bag to go.  \n\nUpon opening the white sack, and unfolding its wrappings, I beheld a large, lovely, heavily onion flaked top, which still carried the aroma of its freshness.  First bite confirmed its recent vintage, and also that it was quite dense and firmly chewy.  Many like this texture in their bagels, but I prefer a crunchier skin and light, airy innards.  \n\nThis was not that, but I appreciated the quality of the product nonetheless.  While I would not seek out All Star for my frequent bagel fix, there are others who will find these dough tires the cat's meow. \n\nFreedom of Choice!",

A couple of raw onion rings, slices of radish, and a pile of lettuce completed the performance.  I cut everything with my fork and enjoyed every bite.  All was tasty, complementary, and filling (I did not finish the rice).  The Pineapple Juice was cool and refreshing with a nice bite of just juiced pulpy fruit.  \n\nThis was an excellent lunch in a comfortable setting.

The space is fairly generic, with minimalist furniture, gray walls, pseudo wood floor and large colorful mural on the back wall. Their one refrigerated display has a lot of beautiful looking pastries, but I was there for breakfast. I found the register toward the rear, and the large wall menu behind the cashier/order taker. With fresh croissant available, I went for a brekkie sandwich of turkey sausage, egg and cheese, and a small mug of coffee. \n\nThe java arrived first and immediately woke me from my morning malaise. It was hot, strong and had a nice bite. It was roasted locally by some guy named Jay, who knows about beans. It was so flavorful I had to ask about it. Just wish I knew whether refills were free, because I would have jumped at the chance. Alas, no one stopped by to pour more, and given that I had already paid upfront for my meal, I didn't feel like testing the question. Still, it was the best part of the meal. \n\nThe sandwich came from the back kitchen, and due to lack of any odor or sound emanating from that area, I concluded that a microwave was used to meld together the sandwich. It was fine, but the croissant was somewhat flattened in preparation, and not as flaky as this roll should be. The flavors worked well together, but it was far from extraordinary. \n\nService was okay, with a new POS system and tactile screen for adding a tip (before being served, nor even seeing what you were getting), and fingering a signature to complete the credit card process. That transaction point might be reconsidered by management, as being asked for a tip at ordering seemed awkward, and likely guaranteed to generate smaller gratuities then when dealt with at the close of the meal. \n\nThat key lime pie looked tempting, so maybe a return visit is warranted. Wouldn't go back for the breakfast, except for the luscious coffee.",

    "text": "Noodle Eighty-Eight (Lucky Noodles), is a surprising hybrid house in Souderton, PA. Nicely renovated residence, the dining rooms are simple, but well appointed for comfort and utilitarian style. We were there for Sunday lunch, although there was no special menu. The main attraction were the Xiao Long Bao, the Shanghai soup dumpling specialty that I had been Jones-ing for. We added mushroom filled spring rolls as a second appetizer, and General Tso's Chicken and Short Ribs as entrees. \n\nIn order of appearance the meal ran from excellent to ordinary. \n\nThe XLB were very good, with steaming tasty pork truffle oil bouillon and filling. The gingered vinegar was a nice complement to pour into the pouch once the top knot was bitten off and the mixed contents sucked out. Such a tactile fun experience. \n\nThe Spring Rolls were deep fried and stuffed with ground mushroom and sweet dipping sauce. They were crunchy, but the filling had little flavor nor interest. Wouldn't get this again.\n\nThe side greens salad was small, but had a pleasing sweet vinegar finish. It's unusual to get a salad in a Chinese house, and this was a tip of their chef's cap to their hybrid intentions. Far better than the ginger goop dressing on iceberg found in almost all sushi zones. \n\nGeneral Tso was the weak soldier this day. The pieces were large requiring cutting to consume (thus, the need for western flatware). The breading was thick and not at all crisp, and the old man had spent too much time being woked. It was dry and lacked any verve. Disappointing.\n\nLuckily, the day was saved by the Short Rib dish. More western than Asian in presentation and taste, it was tender, juicy and packed a tangy punch from the excellently reduced sauce. It pulled off the bone easily. But for the baby bok choy, this reminded of a good pot roast or sauerbraten. Regardless, it was nearly perfect.  \n\nWe made the drive from Newtown in 40 minutes on a rainy afternoon. Given the overall experience it is doubtful we would do it again. The dishes were inconsistent, but priced for perfection. Service was good, but without expected hot tea, nor rice. Also true about the parking situation. Not good unless you park across the road, around the corner or find one of the few that hug the building. \n\n3.5 STARS",

    "text": "The question of the decade is: When it comes to cheesesteak, is there a difference between using a traditional Italian long roll or stepping out with a round poppy seed kaiser? \n\nDonkey's Place on Haddon Avenue in Camden, NJ, has been an iconoclast for a generation, daring to shape shift and challenge all comers to demonstrate that their creation is in any way inferior to the classic torpedo. Now that I sat at the bar, watched the sliced beef being grilled and consumed a whole sandwich 'wit' soft, translucent sauteed onions, I have an opinion. \n\nAnd, it is that there IS a difference in taste and texture that is pronounced and obvious. First, the flavor of the bread is distinct in each. While the Italian roll has a sourdough light saltiness, the round boy is a bit sweet as white bread tends to be. Second, the meat/bread ratio is changed, with relatively more meat to roll at Donkey's. After all, there is less bread in the Kaiser than a foot long. Third, the thin sliced beef is never separated for grilling @ Donkey's, but allowed to cook in a thick pile and turned over so that only the top and bottom of the pack touch hot steel. The rest are heated through passage of the heat through the slices. In my case, it meant that the middle of the sandwich was tender and juicy, while the outer layers were mildly overcooked, tougher and chewier. Forth, the Donk adds spice to the pile of onions simmering on the stove, giving them a reddish orange tint and slight chili flavor. Never experienced that at my favorite joints in and around Philly. \n\nDon't get me wrong, I really liked the sandwich and the overall dive bar essence of this place. Service was pretty and efficient, and I was given a bumper sticker to commemorate the visit. Still, I would be less than honest if I said I liked it just as much as Steve's Prince of Steaks. No. It wasn't as instantly addicting and scrumptious as that. It was a half step down from that pinnacle of steakdom. \n\nStill, overall it was a very enjoyable lunch, with the atmosphere contributing mightily to the fun. I understand what Anthony Bourdain loved about it, but he didn't live cheesesteak his whole life. \n\nDoubtless, I will be back for more.",

    "text": "Cheeseboro's Kitchen is a stand alone building on Pennington Road that does soul food and other American classics.  It is primarily a take away house, with only a few tables along the front window for those who want to eat right there.  Ordering is done at the cash register, and each meal is prepared individually. The finished dishes come out on the other side of the room in front of the pizza ovens left over by the previous tenant.  \n\nThe good thing about this approach is that the meals are hot and fresh.  Only the side dishes were premade and chilled as they wait for you.  The down side of this \"just in time\" production is that when they get busy, the wait can be rather long for your meal to be completed and brought out of the kitchen.  While I was there, people were going outside to wait, or leaving all together to return when the food was ready.  Some customers call ahead, which while a good idea, just prolongs the wait for everyone. \n\nThe people working here, including management, are friendly and appear to be working hard to get the food out.  My questions were answered with a smile, even when I was showing my cultural ignorance about how certain things would be presented.  For example, a \"sandwich\" is not something between two slices of bread, but instead is a load of whatever you want on top of three slices of white bread.  You can make a sandwich of it yourself, but there is way more meat, fish, etc., than can fit within the confines of a manageable sandwich. Easier just to eat the food and as much of the loaf as you desire. Me? I skipped it all together in order to consume as much fish as possible.  Happy to be enlightened. \n\nWhat about my whiting sandwich and side of macaroni salad (recommended)?  Six large fillets, light breading and flash deep fried, made for a delicious lunch.  I could only eat four of them. The macaroni side came in a plastic tub, mixed with copious mayo and bits of tuna.  Cool and great tasting. Again, more than this man could stuff down.  \n\nThe only drawback to Cheeseboro's is the wait for the food to be prepared, and secondarily to the unused space in the store that could be put to use with more tables or perhaps, displays.  The meal, with the side and bottle of iced tea, came to around $12.  Quite reasonable for the quantity and quality of the offerings.  Now that I have a better idea what is going on, I will be back to try the rib sandwich, and perhaps, even their burgers, and more of their side dishes.",

    "text": "This is a tough one to call. \n\nThe premises of Three Monkeys Caf\u00e9 is beautiful, both inside and out. A lot of thought and money was put into bringing the old saloon back to life. From tin-type ceiling tiles, through refinished wood floors, exceptional back bar, and zany monkey decorations throughout, the inner sanctum of this place is a pleasure to sit in and enjoy.  Great job!\n\nThe outer side patio/garden is likewise a wonderland.  Colorful, whimsical, tall treed, and full of monkey business.  On a spring, summer or autumn day or evening, it is no doubt an endearing space for a few drinks and semi-romantic meal.  Gotta love it!\n\nThe weak link is the kitchen. \n\nWe were there for breakfast after visiting the USCIS facility nearby. It wasn't quite warm enough to dine al fresco, so we sat at a corner table in the barroom, and were served by a friendly management person.  We were introduced to Douwe Egbert Coffee, a Dutch brand in operation since 1753.  One of their spinoffs developed a novel approach to mass produced coffee that liquefies it in concentrate, and brews on site and when ordered, so every cup is fresh and strong.  Mine had a mild chicory flavor.  I really liked it, although I would need a lot more sampling and comparison to fresh ground beans to know if it was as good as what I grind/brew at home. Still, it was a pleasant cuppa Joe. \n\nThe sausage, egg and cheese on seeded roll with side of home fries, were the main attractions.  They left me somewhat disappointed.  It was fine that they used cut up links rather than patties, and threw them in with a few scrambled eggs and slices of cheese.  It was very big, because the roll was from a cheesesteak sandwich; not a hard Kaiser.  But, it had not been grilled at all, and did not really work with the breakfast theme.  Too, the mix lacked spice, and would have benefited by being cooked with a pinch of salt, pepper, and maybe even a shake or two of Pecos Bill.  Finally, the potatoes looked great and greasy, but were completely cold.  \n\nA little quality control at the grill, and perhaps retaining a real chef to handle the preparation or at least to train the staff, would make a world of difference.  Three Monkeys has a ton of potential. It just needs to polish the brass and sand the wood trim (culinary-wise) to become a completely enthralling experience.  \n\n3.5 Stars",

    "text": "Redhouse Bagels sits underneath Johnny Apple's Restaurant on Buck Road, Holland, PA.  It is in what was the walkout basement.  Coming from the north, it is easy to miss as it is behind the massive building housing Johnny's.  Still, plenty of parking on the side near the creek.  It is worth finding. \n\nBagels preferences are very subjective, but to my buds, Redhouse does a very good rounder. When fresh and hot from the oven, they are richly textural and flavorful.  They seem to do only one large batch in the early morning, so if you get there late like I did, there is the chance you won't get what you really want.  I'm an onion bagel maven, but as they were all depleted, I grabbed the last everything bagel in the house. Butter and Swiss is my standard order, so that the taste of the bagel complements, rather than being overwhelmed by a heavier load. They did not skimp on the toppings, and the overall experience was very positive. While I prefer a crisper skin and soft innards, this one was more pliant, but still had wonderful flavor to compensate.  The egg bagel was likewise a pleasure to eat according to my beautiful companion. \n\nThe only downside aside from the lack of crunch, was that Redhouse is strictly takeout, with no place to sit and enjoy breakfast.  If I were them, I'd look into clearing some of the brush in the parking lot along the creek, and putting in a few tables and benches for people to enjoy watching the roiling water flow just off the nearby old mill race.  That would be a fantastic place to hang out with good bagel and cuppa joe.",

    "text": "Adrianne, the woman who runs Mommie Joe's told me that the tiny shop at the corner of South Broad and Division Streets in Trenton, NJ, had been slinging Haitian dishes for more than thirty years at that location.  How is it that I never saw it before last week after living and/or working in the TNJ for almost that long?  I guess I just wasn't ready for it. \n\nAfter the cover of each heated chaffing dish was lifted for me to see what was cooking, I had no problem selecting a plate of Black Rice, Oxtail Stew and a couple of golden fried Platanos. The Black Rice was a first for me, but I have learned it is possible to buy it in the right markets.  It acted like the paler version I was accustomed to, with the taste of salt, pepper, garlic, and maybe a touch of something like turmeric or coriander, that only required the spooning of the Oxtail bone and amazing tawny rich sauce to make it explode with a flavor combination that was savory, smoky, meaty and mysterious.  With only plastic utensils to handle the chunkiness of the beef, I really had no choice but to get manual.  It would have been great if lunch had been served on a plate rather than in styro take out containers, but I understand that sometimes low budget is the only way to survive.  \n\nIt became an unruly mess to pick up and gnaw at the tender ox still clinging to this matrix, but after a few seconds I forgot about the office I had to return to, and the white shirt and tie I was wearing, and just let such stolid convention go.  The only way to eat this was DIRTY.  \n\nThe Plantain was thin and nicely breaded before frying.  It was still starchy, but the flavor was compelling.  \n\nMommie Joe's certainly needs a clean up, and a better spacing of the tables that were all pushed together in front of the store, but there is no question of authenticity.  Adrianne even let me come behind the counter to have a better look at her dishes.  She was very confident that I would like what was on the menu.  \n\nShe was right.",

On my first visit, I had the pleasure of sampling their Chili Rellenos from the Latin side of the menu.  They was very good.  This time, I went with the Italian Hot Dog because of my curiosity about how it would be different than all the others I have eaten around Trenton over the years.  Too, at $3.50, it was the best deal in the house.  \n\nI was impressed.  The standard frankfurter arrived at the bottom of an excellent half torpedo roll, and buried alive with a load of saut\u00e9ed onion, pepper and potato.  More French fries on the side.  There was ketchup on the table, but no mustard.  I decided to go with the flow and doctor my sandwich with what was available.  So, I squirted from the red table rocket, and poured in most of the salsa that came with the chips.  \n\nThe result: A hot and spicy creation that looked Italian, but tasted like the hybrid it really was.  The salsa gave it a real kick in the pants, and brought the best out of the sandwich.  I enjoyed every bite. \n\nThe Licuados Tamarindo was cool and a bit sweeter than I prefer, perhaps because it seemed to come premade, rather than made fresh in a blender.  Still, @ $3., I wasn't complaining. \n\nOverall, a very happy face meal.",

Truth is, you guys are not far off the mark.  \"Those places\" do have an attytood. \n\nPerhaps, the lone exception is the Clubhouse Bar and Grill on lower East State Street.

    "text": "Villa Rosa was a regular stop in my early years in Bucks County, but as Newtown evolved into a community with many good restaurants, the need to travel to Lower Makefield (not Yardley), became an unnecessary time expense.  Last night I was driving back from a meeting and found myself hungry and very near Villa Rosa, and decided to stop in and have something light.  \n\nI ordered an Eggplant Parm sandwich.  It arrived a few minutes later in the hands of a pleasant server.  Although the store was scheduled to close in 30 minutes I felt no pressure to eat quickly, and my server returned a few times to check on my satisfaction.  The meal itself was quite good.  The Eggplant was very thinly sliced and lightly saut\u00e9ed in olive oil before placement in the Torpedo Roll for toasting in the oven.  It was not breaded and held up well with the Mozza and Red Gravy.  The Roll itself was crisped nicely before arrival.  I normally just eat the innards and have only a few bites of the bread, which is what I did this time.  It was as filling as I needed it to be.  \n\nOverall, I was satisfied with my repast, and will have no hesitancy to return next time in the area.  Besides, there are a few other decent food outlets in this commercial center, not the least of which is Indian Garden, an excellent curry house.",

The kitchen was now in the back, and the dining room in front; a reversal of its original layout.  New walls and floors made the place feel more upscale than the old place. Nice use of stone, wood and paint. \n\nWe opted for cheesesteak and eggplant parm sandwiches.  Both came with fries. The steak was a full load of chopped beef mixed with onions and mushrooms on a lightly crusted roll.  Very good.  The eggplant was thin sliced, breaded, saut\u00e9ed in olive oil, and then grilled again in the oven, after which it was dosed with their homemade gravy and mozza.  Again, very good. The rolls were notable for their crunch and pleasant taste. The fries were really unnecessary, and were the weakest part of the repast, as frozen crinkle cuts.  \n\nReasonable prices.

But, there is a new pizza joint down there now that provides reason for renewed optimism. \n\nLaLucci Pizza has been open a few months. I stopped in last week for a two slice and a soft drink (water) lunch. Like most pizza parlor these days, it has several prebaked pies on display for consideration and a grill for hot sandwiches. As a first timer, I wanted to try a basic slice and something higher end for comparison. There was a good looking Margherita sitting up front and a regular pie on the counter, both with a few triangles missing. I asked for one of each, and mentioned that I like my reheats well done.\n\nThe store manager brought them to me a few minutes later, steam still wafting off the Vulcan surface. They were a nice size. I sprinkled crushed hot pepper flakes on them and went to work. First bite brought a crunchy report from the firm undercarriage. Very nice! No droop. Slightly salty taste to the sauce and cheese. The regular slice was leaking oil onto the paper plate, but not enough to require a demerit. The red, white and green margherita had the same hard edge crust and the pleasant flavor of fresh basil enhancing the chunky tomato gravy. \n\nBoth were better than the average reheat jobs for the area, and deserving recognition. \n\nHappy to oblige with 4 big ones!",

Prices reflect that they are operating indoors in a newly renovated building with commensurate overhead. Thus, they cannot compete with the open air food carts at FDR nor Mifflin Parks in South Philly, where the vendors pay a yearly licensing fee, rent or buy their small stands, and are otherwise free of fixed costs.  If you don't want to wait for warmer weather for your Cambodian BBQ fix, Khmer Grill is presently your cold weather friend.  \n\nThe food is well marinaded and basted while on the fire.  The result is a pleasant tasting mildly tart/semi-sweet flavor on tender meats that retain their juices.  My sausage was plump and spurted with every firm bite.  The thin sliced beef was easily slipped from its impalement on the bamboo sticks.  Liked them both a lot. \n\nWith any luck, both Khmer Grill and Chinatown Square will be successful and lead the way to other such food malls that have been so successful in the larger Asian population centers in Flushing, NY, L.A., San Fran., and Toronto.  In the space formerly reserved for one restaurant, you can now have a multitude of street food options from around the world. Right. Not the same as a standard sit down meal, but it has its place when interesting light bite snacks are more what you are looking for.  \n\nFor those fortunate enough to have sampled the real thing while travelling through Southeast Asia, Khmer Grill is authentic enough to bring back fond memories.",

That Pretty Bird Coffee is about 50 yards from the green mermaid makes these folks heroic. That they are truly outclassing them is the stuff of legend. \n\nThe space, although a small storefront, is well designed and cozy.  There are a few deuces, high communal tables and a counter for those desiring to maximize the experience by sipping in.  The staff is young and very friendly, with a few managers involved to keep everything flowing.  It was easy to engage in a pleasant conversation with them as I waited for my latte and strawberry donut (homemade). These guys are really making an effort to build their reputation and customer base.  \n\nMy latte was very good. No need for sugar or other adulterants, as it was strong and flavorful on its own.  The donuts were an indulgence, but they were sitting in the work area just staring at me. Impossible to resist.  When I took my first bite, I learned it was a cake donut with an interesting sugar/cinnamon/strawberry sprinkle topping.  Very good, but impossible to eat without a trail of crystals.  Slightly tart, too.  Liked it, but doesn't challenge Yum Yum or Mary's in the gooey goodness department.  \n\nAt $6.50 for the medium cup and the dunker, the price was okay. \n\nPretty Bird is a nice place for meetups, and small conversations. \n\nParking behind the building and in the adjacent lots.",

Indoor and outdoor seating available. Plenty of parking in back. It feels a bit like an escapee from New Hope just a few miles up River Road. \n\nI ordered a Cheeseburger Junior (4 oz., w cheddar, sauteed onions and ketchup), and standard Hot Dog (mustard, ketchup, sweet relish), and Vanilla Shake. The hot dog was very good with firm casing and nice garlic beef profile, in an excellent torpedo roll with capacity to hold everything without leakage or falling off the truck when tipped. Liked it alot. The burger was half consumed by family before I had a photo opportunity.\n\n My portion was decent for a quarter pounder, with juicy chew and flavor from the blend of shortrib, chuck and sirloin used for the puck, and the semisweet onion. The only weak link was the bun which was saturated by grease from the sandwich and did not survive the experience intact due to sogginess. The shake was cool and thick, but began separating before I could drink it all. It seemed to be made from soft-serve and milk rather than real ice cream. Not worth the $5.99 tag. \n\nThe closest comparison among offerings in the fast casual burger universe is 5 Guys. Tommy's hot dogs are superior, their burgers very similar, but the shakes need work. Can't speak to the rest of the menu, but I wouldn't mind returning to find out.",

What followed was the exhaustion of sandwich provisions nationally, resulting in millions of disappointed customers arriving at bright orange & red stores just to discover signs across the wall menu that said, \n\n\" WE'LL BE BACK!\" \n\nI was one of those people at their small shop in Levittown, PA. The line wasn't long, but the sense of delayed gratification was tangible. After all those YouTube vids of people sitting with stacks of regular and spicy mayo sammies wrapped in specially designed paper, and watching them munch them up, rolling their eyes in delight, and attempting to speak waxingly with mouths full, it was almost too much to bear. \n\nSo, I grudgingly went home with a 3 piece dinner to share, knowing I would have a hard time convincing anyone that I didn't eat them on the way. \n\nBrilliant marketing, though!

    "text": "Rice & Curry Asian Bistro is a Thai/Asian fusion house on Limekiln Pike in Maple Glen, PA. Although I ate outside at a table under the overhang, I did go in looking to let someone know I was there. The dining room was attractive, and in a post-Covid world I would definitely chose to dine inside. \n\nTheir menu is divided between standard Thai dishes and Japanese sushi. There may be compromises with strict authenticity for the sake of broadening market appeal, but not so much that close familiarity is missing. In fact, my late lunch and the green curry takeout for family were quite good and definitely worthwhile. I, for one, understand the business decision to find a reasonable common denominator in ingredients and style, as long as the fundamental touch, feel and flavor of the food remains. \n\nThis, Curry & Rice succeeded in doing. \n\nMy Spicy Noodles (not \"Drunken Noodles\") were prepared with medium width rice pasta, rather than the traditional broader noodles, but the sauce was right on and plenty hot enough, with a strong variety of fresh veggies (carrot, string bean, onion, green/red pepper). So, while there was less surface area for the sauce to cling to, it wasn't really noticeable on the tongue, although there was less chew. They also decorated the bowl with an iceberg wedge, which seemed incongruous. Too, my Tom Kha Soup was excellent, with a pleasing hot/cool profile of lemongrass and coconut milk, with a large supply of shredded chicken and fresh mushrooms. I tipped the rim of the bowl to my lips to suck out every drop. My son liked his Green Curry takeout when he got to it hours later. \n\nI appreciated their lunch menu provided somewhat smaller plates at commensurate prices. I was able to push away from the table feeling satisfied without being overfull. \n\nThat is always appreciated.",

    "text": "Devil's Acre Tavern is a very attractive reuse of an old roadhouse along Easton Road (Rt. 611), Plumsteadville, PA. It takes it name from the nearby Devil's Half Acre, originally a stone tavern built in the 18th Century close on the Delaware River that sold alcohol and other services to the river traffic navigating upstream and down in a time the the river was the primary means of transportation in this part of colonial America. In fact, they had no license to make nor sell alcohol, and the joint was a place where violence and shady characters abounded. Legend and history say there were many people killed there and buried in the backyard. \n\nPerhaps, to lessen the reliance on that unsavory history, the name was chosen without the word \"Half,\" but the connection is not lost on those aware of these facts. Still, it appears often enough in the menu and on the walls of the establishment to hint at the local lore. \n\nLuckily, this house is totally legit. Ownership has created an attractive utilitarian space, German American in nature, with excellent cross section of Deutsch brews, quality cocktails, reasonable happy hour choices and a strong kitchen. We stopped in on Saturday afternoon at the start of HH, and thoroughly enjoyed the entire experience. After a little confusion with our new server about availability of happy hour and where to sit to capture those prices, everything was resolved quickly and we waited for delivery to our dining room table of Three Onion Soup, Dragon Wings and Pierogi of the Day apps/sides, and two DHA Burgers and a DHA Dog. \n\nEverything was very good to terrific. My stepson wouldn't share his potage, so it must have been great. We all sampled the wings @$.50 per. They were not too big, but were amply meaty with a good sweet/hot glaze with sesame seeds sprinkled on top. The pierogi were the weak link. The dough was thick, too chewy and dominated the flavor of the seasoned veggies within. Ate one and took the rest home. Maybe sour cream would have helped. \n\nThe burgers were huge with double patties, bacon, lettuce, red onion, and their DHA sauce. Both were past the medium well finish requested, but there was still plenty of flavor and moisture. I loved the double dog with chopped red onion, dark mustard and well done bacon in a fresh crisp torpedo roll. Great taste and texture. @$5 HH price it was a star of the show. \n\nDevil's Acre Tavern is a 35 minute drive from home, but when in the mood for German beer and cuisine it is well worth the trip. Tuesday Burger Night sounds like a winner, too.",

It was fairly near Knox Covered Bridge in Valley Forge Historic Park, and the right place to pick up a late lunch to take home. \n\nWe parked out front and were greeted by a friendly order taker who handed us a paper menu and made good suggestions in response to our inquiry about what they did best. The conversation led to ordering Homemade Laotian Sausage, Nam Khao Salad and spicy Drunken Noodles with Beef. Fifteen minutes later she returned with our neatly packed meal. \n\nArriving home 50 minutes later, the sausage was still warm, the salad cool and the drunkens, hot. We liked all three dishes. The sausage had the interesting flavor of lemongrass, cilantro, onion and ground veggies mixed with pork. It came with a small side of mashed chilli sauce which added a kick. The Nam Khao was cool and hot with special mention to the crushed peanuts that were fried with a mild sweetener that added unusual interest to the dish. The Drunken Noodles were wide rice pasta loaded with green pepper, onion, carrot and sprouts in a three star hot scale brown gravy. Delicious. \n\nWe can only imagine how much better our meal would have been had we been able to eat in restaurant when everything was right from the kitchen. Still, it was good enough to make a return visit when it is safe to enjoy a sit down right at the source.",

    "text": "The name on the Spring Menu breakfast was: \"I Can't Believe They're Vegan Pancakes.\" \n\nWell, now I know that was just a bit of clever marketing, because after eating the nearly tasteless, dry, syrup sponges, I now fully believe they WERE vegan, and in a word, \"boring.\"  My high hopes were dashed by reality. \n\nBut, I forgive Turning Point for misleading me, because everything else about their new facility in the Village @ Newtown Shopping Center, is first class. The room is sun filled, bright and airy, with high fanned ceilings, white walls, and copious amounts of glass, letting customers be part of any sunny day outside while they sup within. A definite country cottage vibe throughout. Service is uber friendly without being unctuous, and the $2.50 house brewed java comes with a insulted pitcher of coffee, mug, and small glass carafe of milk (upon request). More than enough for me. \n\nI enjoyed sitting at the bar and watching the coffee operation in front of me, and the dining room activity through the backbar mirrors. The rest of the menu was appealing for both morning and afternoon meals, even if the prices reflected the cost of Newtown's newly discovered sophistication (falling into the category of be careful what you wish for). \n\nTurning Point, like its sibling nearby, Harvest, is the new order of things around here. Along with all the other restaurants already there, and those being planned (Chipotle, Iron Hill, Starbucks, Melt Shop, etc.), they will either become a sought after destination for fast casual dining, or a place to be avoided because of inadequate parking, and too much sameness. There is already talk of the center becoming a food court. \n\nIt definitely feels like a gold rush around here, and it remains to be seen how deep and wide the rich vein goes. It will thrive for a while, but whether it becomes a permanent part of life or a ghost town, depends on changing tastes, the local economy and how well conceived the plans were at the start.",

The shop is deep and quite narrow, obviously carved out of an adjoining store to create another retail space. Maybe a dozen tables in front, with the food spread out on a table right outside the kitchen. \n\nThere was plenty to choose from made up of a mix of chicken, vegetarian and even a goat curry dish. Some were very freshly prepared, while others were past their prime from sitting out over a steam table, inevitable when dealing with buffets. Still everything I tasted was good to excellent, especially the veggie korma and custom made garlic naan. Appreciated all the beautiful yellows, reds and amber colors from all the sauces. \n\nI enjoyed my meal. At $11.99 for AYCE, I thought it a very good deal. \n\nService was minimalist, but how much to expect when basically serving yourself? My water glass was refilled, the used plate removed from the table promptly and the naan brought out from the tandor oven when fully baked and steaming hot. \n\nWhat's not to like?!",

I was sipping from their signature hippo snifter a moment later. She also handed me a menu. I quickly decided on the whiskey bacon burger, pink. \n\nWhat I received was a half pounder with melted cheese, crisp bacon, lettuce, tomato and red onion. While beyond pink, it was still fresh and tasty with a sweetish bun. I needed knife and fork to disassemble the thick sandwich.

Bambino has a corner to himself to play and watch TV.  \n\nIf an earnest desire to please was paramount, Aida would be a 5 Star experience.  I have seldom seen a server express the sweet insecurity of both expressing how wonderful she believes the food to be, and at the same moment showing her deepest hope that the customer will agree with her. \n\nThose eyes.\n\nThe bathos was as rich as the creamy White Wine Lemon Butter Sauce on my Scaloppine Di Pollo (Francoise). It was a very good dish.  Luckily, the two home baked rolls were big enough for me to rip them apart throughout the meal and soak up both the Olive Oil and the zesty yet silky sauce.  The large plate also held the side House Salad of Lettuce, Tomato, Onion, Olive Oil and Vinegar.  \n\nIf I had had room, the house desserts looked very appealing sitting in the front display. Maybe next time. Aida is worth another look.",

    "text": "When a young and growing child runs through a pair of athletic shoes in a matter of months, the need for a fairly priced distribution point becomes a financial necessity.  \n\nSo it is that Dick's Sporting Goods a big box store very near the Oxford Valley Mall comes into play.  It is in the rear of that warehouse of a retail outlet that all varieties of foot gear are displayed and available for purchase.  Where some of the smaller shops have a few designs in a few colors from a few manufacturers, Dick's offers the most of all.  Too, if paying attention to the flyers in the mail or email advertisements, it is possible to save substantially.\n\nSize 12 Nike Air basketball shoes listed for sale at $85, were actually secured for $20 less with the help of those coupons and cards.  The cashier was very helpful in making sure we got the best possible price.  \n\nKnowing we will be back in about 90 days to replace the worn out Nikes with a new and likely larger pair, is a good incentive for both parties to maintain good relations.  \n\nSee you then, Dick.",

    "text": "A breakfast meeting brought me to Cafe Chorba in the Morrisville Shopping Center, just across the Calhoun St. Bridge from Trenton, NJ. \nThe cafe is a little hard to find, tucked into the east side of the center. Don't give up if you don't see it right away, as it is worth your while to find it, and chow down.\nThe environment is diner-like in terms of menu, but more like a luncheonette in ambiance. Very Americana, despite its Turkish name. \nI had the french toast.  It was among the best FT I have had.  A slight crunch on the outside, and soft and totally cooked on the inside.  Thick sliced fresh bread makes for a very nice meal with good coffee.  My meeting partner had eggs over and scrapple.  She said the \"meat\" was well above average. I admit to never having tried it. \nThe cost for the 2 breakfasts with coffee, $12. \nFriendly staff, and decent traditional breakfast, lunch and dinner menu.  \nI will definitely return when the opportunity presents itself.  \nSuggestion: Offer real maple syrup for french toast and pancakes.  That would add to the overall value proposition here.  Even if charging extra for it, it would upgrade the experience beyond the little packages of industrial syrup provided now. \nOverall - Very pleased!",

    "text": "I knew something was up when I walked into Hogeland's Corner Grill and the counter was full but for the very last spinner.  Laughter and the strong hum of conversation was the tip off that this joint was the hang for an old crew.  The fact that a stranger had just entered did not change the pace of socializing.  I was just another friend they had never met before.  Welcome!\n\nThe space is small, with only 4 quads and a counter with room for 8. Cozy. An ancient 12\" TV hung from the ceiling.  The Formica countertop, old wall signs, and attentive silverhairs bustling around, contributed to the sense of being in a 70's / 80's sitcom, Mel's Diner.  Happy to play my part.  Irma, Sherry, and Steve were right out of central casting, with white aprons, dual-fisted coffee pots, and very long spatulas. They were open and diligent, friendly and forthcoming about the history of what has been several incarnations of a coffee shop/luncheonette over the past 20-odd years.  You know that something special has happened when a former worker becomes an owner, and then after selling the business continues to work at the place she loves.  That speaks to the closeness of the people, and the magic that happens when they are together.  \n\nAll of that would be only a quaint tale if the food slung was not worth the price of admission to the theater.  It certainly was.  From my front row seat I watched everything.  After ordering Coffee and French Toast, I saw the bread bathed in egg and placed on the grill.  Steve lovingly pushed it around to be sure the surface was touching metal, and then cut the 3 slices with his spatula.  He asked if I wanted Powdered Sugar and Cinnamon on it, and I liked the idea.  He sprinkled it on after plating the toast, and walked over to lay it in front of me.  A little butter, a squirt of syrup, and I was ready to go.  \n\nIt was great!  I prefer my French Toast to possess a little crispy crunch from the hot grill caramelizing the egg/butter/bread intersection.  It had that, while remaining soft and fully egged within.  It has been a long time since I had that, and I was pleased.  \nThe Coffee was very good and was refilled before I had gotten half way through. I liked that I was asked if I wanted a refill before the pour, so I could decide how much was needed to maintain the right coffee/milk balance.  \n\nAll the while, I was drawn into various conversations with the other patrons at the counter, so by the time I was ready to pay the bill and go, people were asking when I would return to continue the banter.  Turns out, I knew one of the guys that came in after me, and after a short exchange of kindnesses, I said I would be back very soon.  \n\nRichboro is not exactly in my home zone, but for an experience like this, I will certainly make the trip when my mornings allow.  Hogeland's is on the short list of exceptional breakfast emporiums.  Hear tell that lunches are good, too.",

    "text": "Leave it to Yelp to uncover yet another gem in the rough.\n\nIn this case, the rough refers to the section of North Brunswick Avenue in Trenton where Pho Tan has staked its claim and hopes to mine Vietnamese gold out of its kitchen.  In the shadow of the former Helene Fuld Medical Center, this unassuming storefront houses an authentic menu that turns out very good VN cuisine.  The space shows signs of originally being a Mexican joint, but I have no problems with that.  \n\nThe staff is very friendly (and cute), and the owner/chef is checking with his customers to be sure they are satisfied and to tell his story of this 3 month old enterprise.  The room fills up in the evening with compatriots, some of whom are obviously family.  They fill the air with Vietnamese jokes and deference to the seniors among them.  Very nice to be part of this culture for the evening. \n\nI wanted to try the Banh Mi with Roast Pork, and a Small Bowl of Pho with Flank and Tendon.  At $4. the Baguette Sandwich was large and stuffed with the Pork, Cucumber, Cilantro, Carrot, and some kind of Mayo.  A squirt of Hoisin from the table rocket brought the combination to the right flavor quotient.  It was very good, although the Pork had some rough spots.  It was enjoyable.  \n\nThe Pho was accompanied by a full plate of Basil, Lime, Sprouts, & Jalapeno Slices that helped the simmering broth attain full taste.  The heat of the soup slowly cooked the once rare Beef to a nice medium.  The Noodles at the bottom of the bowl were hidden beneath the Beef and condiments, and had to be raised with my chopsticks and flat bottom spoon.  Once thoroughly mixed, the full mastery of this creation came to the fore.  It was a mighty fine bowl of Pho, full of subtle flavors and textures that were a pleasure to uncover a layer at a time.  I could not finish it, and was glad I had not asked for the larger portion.  \n\nPho Tan has great possibilities.  I need to try their Vietnamese Coffee and Summer Rolls to be sure it is as good as my first impressions.  It will not take long for me to return to sample those things and revisit my ranking.  \n\nPho Tan could be very special. \n\nGood luck to Mr. Tan and his family in this endeavor\n\n\nSEPTEMBER 10, 2014 - Returned this evening for another run at Pho Tan, and went with the Pho Ga (Chicken) and Spring Rolls.  The Spring Rolls were deep fried and stuffed with ground spiced pork.  Aside from the oily skin, the app was tasty and filling.  The dipping sauce seemed a bit thin and less sweet/pungent than expected.  A little more potency and thickness would improve the final result.  \n\nThe Pho Ga only came in the LARGE size, and I could not finish it.  The broth was new in that it did not taste like it had been simmering for a long time to bring out the spicy flavors.  I added a shot of Sriracha to bring it up a notch.  However, the Chicken Breast slices were fresh, thick and plentiful.  It was the most chicken I had ever had in my pho.  I prepped a small dish with a mix of Hoisin and  Sriracha to dip the chicken in before eating.  Tasted great!  All the other fixings were on the table, and I put most of them into the bowl.  Good quantity of noodles lurking in the bottom of the bowl.",

It would have been even better with real maple syrup, but then the price would have been much higher.  \n\nThere are a high percentage of regulars here which adds to the attraction.

Yet, there is an issue with traffic flow between the front doors and the counter.  The coffee is right in the central area and can get a little congested.  A redesign might help.  \nThe food is all decent, if slightly more expensive than other places in the area. Sandwiches, soups, salads for lunch.  Oatmeal, bagels, muffins, omelets for breakfast.  \nA community room adds to the neighborhood flavor.  There are always meetings going on of various sizes, and it is really nice that these activities were taken into consideration.  \nParking is an issue, as the undersized lot is shared with TD Bank.  Any time near lunch is an adventure in parking.  Be prepared to park and walk a couple of minutes. As Woody Allen might say after a poor parking performance, \"It's all right.  We can take a taxi from here.\"\n\n6.01.13 - Time for an upgrade to 4 Stars. This morning walked in for a meeting reserved for the Community Room. Apparently, whoever took down the info was NOT the manager, and they knew nothing about it. Grrr...But, the real manager and his staff jumped into action and prepared the catering we required for the 12 people and 2 hour meeting.  Everything else went smoothly. \n\nFor stepping up when it would have been easier to just shrug and give empty apologies, they took care of us with professionalism and a smile. Time to move into a better neighborhood, CBC.  Thanks!",

    "text": "First the Big News!\n \nOishi is moving to another part of the Village of Newtown Shopping Center!  They will be taking over the space formerly occupied by Basil Leaf and Lee's Hoagie House in the portion of the Center that has McCaffery's Supermarket.  It will take several months for that to happen, but it received its conditional use approval from Newtown Township last week, so it will move forward.  The space where the restaurant currently resides will remain a restaurant under the same ownership, but with a different orientation.  You heard it here first. \n\nThe current Japanese, Thai, Korean success story is about to write a new chapter.  But, the old story is still a very good one.  They still present some of the best sushi, sashimi, and true Asian fusion in Bucks County and the surrounding area. I returned there yesterday for lunch for the second time since joining Yelp.  The ambiance remains hushed dark wood and stone tones that are very comforting and warm.  The activity of the white hats behind the sushi bar continues to offer the sights and sounds of sharp steel knives on  cool granite as the Zen of fish slicing and rice molding into seaweed wraps captures our attention and imagination.  Quite a show!  When the orders are sufficient to keep the fish ultra fresh, the production is razor fast and the taste sensational.  Me? I love the Crunchy Tuna, but I am happy with whatever is put in front of me.  The Wasabi and Ginger are also fresh, so the mix into the light soy sauce complement each other perfectly.  \n\nYesterday, my companions and I were in the mood for soup and noodles.  Three had variations of soups with Udon, Tofu and Chicken.  All looked great in the asymmetric bowls (see photo), and my Pad Thai, while bathed in a slightly unusual peanut sauce, was still quite good, although I do prefer the versions offered by Duck Sauce and Aroi Thai. \n\nWe were all happy with our meals. \n\nWhy not 5 Stars?  The prices are a couple of bucks higher than the competition, and they did not bring tea to the table, nor inquire if we wanted any.  The staff was courteous, but not particularly friendly, nor forthcoming with answers to our questions, nor suggestions.  They seem to believe that they are working in the best place in Newtown for this cuisine, and perhaps there was a sniff of arrogance in their demeanor.  That attitude always starts at the top and is passed down to the staff.  Some carry it off well, but most do not.  \n\nOishi is well named, but there is more to being a great restaurant than just having \"delicious\" food.",

I was the sole customer and had my pick of tables and all the attention of the lovely proprietress.  I went with a Scallion Pancake and the Soft Noodles with Peanut Sauce.  The Pancake was hot and the heat waves off it had the aroma of spring onion. Crispy and tasty.  Very nice.  The Noodles were a large plate (see photo), way more than I could eat, but with a wonderful creamy sauce topped with slivers of Red and Green Pepper, Sprouts and sprinkled with Sesame Seeds.  Delicious. \n\nI took half of it home, and my car smelled great the whole way. \n\nThe prices seem an issue here.  The apps and noodle dishes seemed fairly marked, and the \"Homestyle\" offerings @ $10.50 across the board were alright.  I did not go for the \"Main Courses,\" but at $15.95 for all items there, it seemed too much given the overall feel of the place.  Not sure I would be drawn to that part of the menu given all the other less expensive things ahead of it.  There is also a 24 count \"Lunch Special\" menu that is worth a look @ $6.50.  \n\nCertainly a decent place for veggie lovers to fill up. \n\nAptly named.",

Although as colorful as a Thai temple with rusty orange hues and elephants abounding, sitting in a quiet corner with the air cooling only ourselves, it felt a chill oasis. \n\nThe menu offered plenty of choices from soup to noodles, curry to bigger game like chicken, pork, beef and duck. We order Chu Chee Duck and Crazy Noodles, with appetizer of Curry Puffs. \n\nIn reverse order; the Curry Puffs reminded of Indian Samosas -  Sweet and White Mashed Potato, Onion, Peas,  mixed in mild Curry powder, deep fried, with semi-sweet/spicy Chili Dipping Sauce in a small brass dish. Excellently golden. Crisp shell. Tasty innards. Tart sauce. Liked it a lot!\n\nThe Crazy (Drunken) Noodles with tender Sliced Beef was a load and a half with big Fat Noodles, Veggies, and hot spicies. Plenty of dry Chili Pepper flakes in the mix. So glad we had Thai Iced Tea to tamp down the flames. \n\nChu Chee Duck had wonderfully crisp skin, moist delicious meat and a pale orange cream curry sauce. This became slightly sloppy finger food, as every morsel was too good to miss and required close examination and tongue probing to suck it all off the bone. \n\nThere are many very good Thai houses in and around Philly, and AmeriThai is certainly one. It is a little frayed around the edges, but it fits well with the neighborhood. Others mentioned that the kitchen is inconsistent, but I don't know about that yet. What I know is that when they get it right, it is an excellent place for dinner.",

The menu looked to be about the same, with the exception of a Specials Menu that had been in place long enough to justify its own handout upon seating.  The prices appeared to be about the same as my last visit.\n\nWhile I am not usually enamored of the chain ethnic shops, I admit that this most recent experience was of a higher quality than the last.  I didn't remember what I ordered last time, but it turned out I ordered it again.  I did not care for it according to my last review, but this time, the Garlic Rosemary Chicken on the \"Lite\" menu was actually pretty good.  The two breasts had been well-grilled, and the garlic clove sauce was not at all salty.  The mashed were very good.  \n\nMy companions were in their first exposure to Olive Garden, and were also quite happy with their Stuffed Chicken Marsala.  \n\nFinally, the three-way split of the Apple Crustada dessert was also a good ending to a surprisingly decent Italian-esque meal. It was a very good version of apple pie a la modec complete with a drizzle of Caramel Sauce.  Given the improvement in quality, we would certainly welcome another gift card.  \n\nKeep up the good work!",

It has been a corner neighborhood watering hole for at least the last 80 years, under several owners and in various disguises.  \n\nThis most recent incarnation is a comfortable dive that it almost too cute for that distinction.  It is bright and airy for a small space, with lots of color, and well maintained barroom. The bartender working the afternoon shift when I stopped in for lunch was a lifelong local and took pride in his work.  The bar itself is the shape of a \"Question Mark,\" with the open end toward Hamilton Avenue, and the tail toward the rear near the pool table.  It is in good shape given its age, although the stools could stand refurbishment.  \n\nThe menu covers breakfast, lunch and dinner, with special attention to oversized omelets, burgers and other hot sandwiches.  My large Burger with Cheddar, Fried Onions and Jalapeno Slices was better than expected, although it was obviously a prepackaged frozen disk.  It was closer to well done than the medium requested, but I don't mind cutting the kitchen some slack given that the result was still tasty and I had no expectations that it would be a gastronomic delight.  It was a satisfying chew, and came with choice of sides, for $6.75.  Very good deal.\n\nThe conversation was pleasant throughout, and the folks coming in and out all seemed to know the barkeep and all exchanged upbeat repartee.  \n\nThe suds were mostly American, with the usual suspects from abroad.  This is not a craft dispensary; nor should it be.  \n\nOverall, Marty's Place feels like a winner for a quick lunch and conversation.

    "text": "The Tai Nam, Ve Don (Rare Steak & Crispy Flank) was a perfect counterpoint to the biting cold running rampant in the streets of Chinatown last night. \n\nThe space on the corner of 10th and Arch is small, but well maintained. The service is efficient, if not overly friendly, nor chatty.  But, given that there was a large bowl of steaming funky pho placed before me about 2 minutes after ordering, they can afford to let their speed and excellent broth do the talking. I found it rich and subtle with plenty of time simmering in a huge pot in the kitchen.  The star anise played second violin to the beef stock's leading melody.  The noodles were submerged beneath the ample supply of thinly sliced rare and well done meats.  It was all I wanted.\n\nSome nights are just a little strange, and it wasn't even a full moon.  On my walk over to Pho Cali I was stopped by a man who told a story so believable about having his tools and wallet lifted, that I gave him cab fare home.  On the way out of the caf\u00e9, I was stopped again.  This time by a woman who claimed to be an art student in Jersey. She just wanted to take photos of me while I made a crazy face.  I obliged, half thinking that I would find myself on Facebook looking like a madman.  The end of a promising career in public service. \n\nI just rolled with it all.  As long as the pho was superlative, I could tolerate almost anything.\n\nDark streets. Cold winds. Bizarre interactions. Take your best shot.",

    "text": "Time warp pizza parlor with several HD TVs to remind everyone that their prices may be incredibly cheap (a la 1980), but they are still state of the art video-wise.  \n\nThe regular Pizza Slice has a strong firm crust that holds its point even when somewhat cooled (second slice).  There is a preference for cheese over tomato sauce, making this a pizza rather than a T. Pie.  The taste is good, but the dominance of the cheese makes it a heavier experience with a bit of oil drip, rather than the more subtle flavors that arise when the sauce takes priority with hints of plum tomato, basil, oregano, garlic and even sugar.  \n\nNot a bad place for a quick lunch with a throwback flair.  Even the local constabulary has been known to drop in for lunch.  Two slices of regular pizza and a medium fountain drink (iced tea) comes in at $5.  Hard to beat!\n\nYou may not get the sensations of some of the more famous pizza houses in the area (you know who they are), but neither are you being asked to pay a premium for the privilege of manging on a pie with pedigree.  \n\nAnthony's Pizza Palace is a fun dine down memory lane.  The large pies are at most $17., and the dinners top out at $12.95, complete with salad and bread.\n\nThere is a place in the world for decent cheap Italian grub.",

    "text": "What do you get when you mix a Vietnamese wife and chef, who spend many years in Cambodia, with a Chinese husband and entrepreneur? \nNeon Phnom Penh Restaurant on 7th and Wolf in deep South Philly, and some very good unintentional fusion dishes from that golden triangle of spicy cuisine. This small corner house with eight tables and booths has a cozy feel, from the wall art and houseplants, down to the Buddha shrine sitting on the floor with oranges in supplication. \n\nWe ordered their spring rolls (3 for $5), beef with fat noodles, and beef lo mein. They were all good to very good, but the star of the show were the deep fried spring rolls that had a great rough texture and were filled with ground pork, veggies, sprouts and homemade sweet dipping sauce with peanuts chunks. They were nearly a meal by themselves. \n\nThe fat noodles were also quite delicious with plenty of tender sliced beef, Chinese broccoli, string beans, onions, peppers, scallions and a tasty brown sauce that melded everything together.  Liked this a lot. The lo mein was also good, but not at the level of the former dishes. It had an interesting, indefinable almost smoky flavor, with plenty of meat and greens, but not as scrumptious as everything else. \n\nWe ended up taking half of each of the mains home with us, and one of the rolls, for subsequent consumption by our son.  He devoured all this the same night, and claimed to like it all, while also questioning the ingredients of the lo mein and that somewhat odd taste. \n\nStill, a worthy stop in the heart of Cambodiatown. Plenty of atmosphere, and a friendly family team that spent more time that normal chatting with us about their lives in Asia and Philly. Good people with an interesting story to tell. \n\nMade for an entertaining and satisfying dining experience.",

    "text": "After a hiatus of a few years, I returned to Four Rivers for an early dinner late last week.  The first thing I noticed was how much cleaner the place looked, and the new furniture really helped the joint feel more respectable.  Nice job.\n\nThe servers were friendly and attentive; another plus.  The new (clean) menus had the traditional Szechuan style cuisine, plus a curtsy to the American palate with some of the usual neutered dishes to avoid mouth burn.  It was my good fortune to dine with a Chengdu friend and she went after the dishes with glee after questioning the waitperson for a few minutes about how the dishes were prepared.  Satisfied, she went to work: Duck & Seaweed Soup, Crystal Wonton in Hot Oil, Dan Dan Noodles with Minced Pork, Double Saut\u00e9ed Pork Belly, Water Spinach & Garlic, and White Rice.  \n\nThe soup was a first for me.  I like Duck, but was not sure how I felt about mixing seaweed into the broth.  Fear not.  It was really delicious.  The large serving bowl overflowed with meaty chunks of tender Duck that was easily sucked off the bone.  The brackish flavor of the seaweed somehow complemented the bird's taste, enhancing them both.  I had several small bowls of it throughout the meal.  \n\nThe Dan Dan Noodles were served lukewarm in temperature, and insufficiently spicy for me.  I asked for a side dish of Hot Chili Oil, and once engaged with the pasta and Pork, it came alive.  My sidekick loved it.  The Crystal Wonton in Hot Oil presented a semi-diaphanous skin with a delicate tail in a rich red hot oily sauce.  It reminded me of the Butterfly Dumplings found in nighttime food carts that set up shop everywhere in Chengdu after sunset.  These little darlings were made by hand only minutes before boiling. \n\nThe Pork Belly was tender with plenty of Red and Green Peppers in the mix.  Good, but I have had better in town.  Finally, the Water Spinach was done the traditional way with a load of fresh sliced Garlic thrown in with the thin leafed variety of this veggie. \n\nPrices were very good for the amount of food we had on the table.  About $50. including tip.  I would definitely return with little prompting, but would probably choose E Mei on Arch as my go to Szechuan/Chongqing style dinner in Chinatown.",

The kitchen is a factory operation which you can watch as you wait at the register to pick up your food.  It is a beehive. \n\nThe pizza is very good and the Brooklyn Pie an excellent version of Sicilian with semi-sweet sauce, basil leaves, and copious mozzarella.  The Spring Mix is loaded with Green Apple slices, Walnuts, Feta, and first class Balsamic. The times I have eaten in house, everything has been well presented, tasty, and in abundance.  Most of the menu is traditional Italian American fare, so if you have a more adventurous palate, you may want to try Vecchia Osteria., or travel a bit farther afield to Philly or NYC. \n\nOtherwise, you can't go wrong with Piccolo.",

It is surprisingly attractive inside with mirrored walls and large dining areas.  Service was excellent, with friendly repartee and suggestions for first timers like me.  \n\nI chose the eggplant parm sandwich, which came with chips.  For two bucks more, I could have had a side salad.  Prices were right at $7.25 for this grinder.  I made a good selection, because the hot sammy arrived a few minutes later steaming from its visit to the oven to melt the cheese and crisp the good Italian torpedo roll.  \n\nThe eggplant had been sliced very thin and saut\u00e9ed in olive oil before making its way to the roll where the chef put the remaining pieces together.  I appreciated that the nightshade was so thin that it was easy to heat and remained fully tender. No breading to add unwanted calories; just ripe melanzane. The homemade red sauce was slightly sweet with a nice basil undertone. The mozzarella was also quality and did not sweat from the oven's heat.  The roll was crunchy and good tasting (although I only ate half of it).  This was a very good rendition, although next time I would ask for extra sauce on the side as there wasn't quite enough to fully mix with the base ingredients below.  \n\nStill, Momma Flora's was a pleasant surprise for a neighborhood osteria. I will definitely return to try the tomato pie and some of their dinner offerings.",

This was my maiden voyage to Bagelocity/Soup King, although I had liked its name since driving by the store in a strip center on Bensalem Road a few years ago. \n\nI went with my favorite combination breakfast bagel sandwich with butter and swiss (love the interplay of nutty swiss cheese and those onion flakes on my tongue). With coffee the price was under $4, compared to a couple of bucks more for the same thing at my local place in Yardley. \n\nThe shop has been around for a while, but is still comfortable and clean. The staff I dealt with were friendly and brought the bagel to my booth when ready. Although I prefer a lighter, more airy, less kneaded round, I would certainly return to Bagelocity, especially to check out their soups and try a few more bagels.",

It has been in one family for decades. While not the best of neighborhoods, and a bit frayed around the edges,  they do prepare very good and filling dishes. \n\nWe ordered standard cheesesteak and eggplant parmesan sandwiches to check out their basics. Both were very good, if not best of breed. They were loaded - one with a ton of chopped steak, onions and cheese, and the other with thin sliced, breaded and fried nightshade, red gravy and mozzarella, run through the oven to melt and crisp everything. They use excellent torpedo rolls that toast up well and had a good flavor. \n\nWhile straight up steak houses like Steve's in the Northeast/Langhorne and Dalessandro's in Roxborough, are the class of the field for steaks, these guys do a credible job for a corner neighborhood  place. Aside from a kitchen that works eggplant without breading and has faith in its sauce and olive oil to provide enough mass and taste on their own, A&S is as good as the best of them. \n\nIt's good to have strong local choices at fair prices.",

Those baguettes and demi-pain looked great and tempting enough to want to return for a sandwich to sample the crunchy crust of traditional French bread. \n\nOn the way out I stepped on the old ceramic tile floor that had anchored Robbins for decades and was left in place by the new business.

    "text": "El Negro De Oro (Black Gold) is a new Ecuadorian restaurant at the corner of Sewall and S. Broad in Hamilton, New Jersey.  It is easy to find because it is painted the colors of its name and stands out in an otherwise drab urbanscape.  Street parking is required, but the side streets around there offer plenty of space for a short stroll to the entrada. \n\nWalking in, the color combination grabs your attention immediately. Black and gold floors and walls.  The house has been open only three months and the atmosphere is clean and bright with a small counter near the kitchen entrance, and an area for entertainment off to the side.  They did a very good job turning a small grocery/deli into an attractive place to dine.  \n\nService was warm and informative and we had no trouble understanding each other though all accents (including mine) were thick as homemade salsa.  The menu is bilingual which is very helpful.  I ordered the Special Lunch of the Day, Catfish/Yam Soup and Quarter Roast Chicken with Red Beans and Rice.  A couple of dishes of salsa tagged along, one a traditional Green Sauce, and the other a more unusual thick Yellow Grainy Sauce, which had an unusual flavor that mixed well with the chicken and rice. Think Adobo.  \n\nThe Soup contained a tender chunk of Catfish, bone in and with skin.  It was very tasty.  The orange color of the soup base came from the Yams in which everything simmered for many hours.  There was some spice thrown in for good measure.  The sweetness of the tubers was the most obvious flavor, and cooking the fish in it was an excellent approach, as the mild white meat of the Catfish had nicely picked up the Yamminess from the stewing process.  \n\nThe Chicken was smaller than the typical clucker found in most restaurants, and had the look of a Cornish Hen, although the taste was not gamey.  I was able to pull it apart with knife, fork and fingers and suck the meat off the bones.  Liked it a lot.  The White Rice absorbed the juices from the bird and Red Beans and was a good companion to the rest of the plate.  \n\nWhile eating, the owner/chef came out to check on my satisfaction.  I learned that his nickname was \"Black Gold,\" and that he was also a trained Italian chef.  As if to prove this point, he came out with a piece of Tiramisu prepared in his kitchen.  While this is not my normal tea and crumpets, it was soft, rummy, creamy and sweet.  I suggest he consider adding a few of his best Italian dishes on the menu to broaden the appeal of his shop.  There are not many Ecuadorian/Italian places around here (or anywhere).  \n\nEl Negro De Oro is another of the first rate Latin kitchens sprouting up in Trenton and Hamilton.  It is a variation of what we know as Mexi/Guat/Salvador/Puerto Rican/Dominican/Cuban restos, and well worth a visit.  \n\nThe cuisine and the hospitality are the real deal.",

While the name originally referred to the railroad station that was once close by, that stop has moved into history, and the sense of the house now is that it is more the terminus of two old generational trails.  Although renovated, it has the feel of an older way station that still carries its legacy and kitchen skills very well.  \n\nThe customer base is interestingly diverse, but the common thread seems to be old time locals who know where to find good, cheap vittles, and who are loyal to their institutions.  Can't blame them.  There is something deep and authentic about this place; its cramped booths and tables, its classic servers, and its faithfulness to real American grub.  No brunch served here. No mimosas.  Just straight ahead, no apologies, grill'em-ups. \n\nThe coffee flowed strong and free.  Not the best, but we were not here for La Colombe. All we wanted was caffeinated washdown, and got it. The Country Omelet was a 2 egger loaded with taters and 'yons, with grilled sausage added for taste and texture. Delicious, with a side of toasted rye.  The home fries had crisp edges, but could have used more flavor.  So be it. There was also the option for grits. Maybe next time. \n\nReally liked The Terminal Resto.  Next time I feel like taking a drive in the country and into the past, I might find myself terminating the excursion right here.",

There is a dining area to one side and a ten stool counter overlooking the grill on the other. The menu is traditional Americana breakfast and lunch, with prices the remind of the earlier years of the century. Nice to have lower rents. \n\nOn arrival it was a full house, but for a couple of spinners. When none of the earlier people waiting for tables wanted them, we accepted with gratitude. Not sure about the tables, but we felt lucky to be able to watch the show from our orchestra seats. \n\nOur black shirt server came over promptly for drink requests, and kept her poise and humor despite the beehive of activity around her. The Bunn-O-Matic java was average, but it did provide a buzz and washed down our meal, which we thoroughly enjoyed. My better half went with a beef sausage, egg and cheese on kaiser, while I asked for french toast and bacon. Both were very good. The sammy was a two egger on a fresh and tasty roll. The frenchie had a great vanilla/sugar/cinnamon egg mix that saturated the three bread slices to the core leading to strong texture and taste. The crisp caramelized edges were aces. Melted butter and Kraft syrup pour and I was a happy man. Maple syrup would have made this dish perfect. \n\nAll the while we watched the chef (he was so much more than a short order cook) move through the orders without wasted motion. Grasping eggs with one hand, cracking them into a stainless bowl, and whipping them with a fork with the other; then pouring them onto the hot steel while shaping and flipping them with spatchula, before sliding the finished omelet or over easys, smoothly onto a plate. He then quickly scraped away the residue on the grill into the trough while he moved the plate to the counter to be retrieved for serving.  His efficiency was astonishing. He was intense and focused, and when a server expressed impatience waiting for her order despite his masterly effort, he reminded her with rich irony that he only had two hands. Two?!  It looked like four from where we sat. \n\nCan't ask for more than a solid breakfast and great floorshow. They should charge a premium for those counter seats.",

They asked if I wanted anything more in the sandwich and happily added sweet peppers to the project.  \n\nThe \"market\" part of the operation offers limited provisions for those in need of a few small items.

I enjoyed the nostalgic break.  \n\nOpening the foil wrapped sandwich at my desk, I beheld a nicely packed load of turkey and cheese with lettuce, mayo and the peppers.

I liked it.  \n\nThere is a small sitting area in a corner of this deli that could be a nice place to sit and enjoy morning coffee and a made to order breakfast sandwich.  \n\nI intend to return to find out, and continue my conversation with the nice folks there.",

    "text": "Georgian Bread Cuisine on Bustleton Avenue in Northeast, Philly, is an excellent deli/restaurant specializing in the very interesting and tasty kitchen from this small nation in eastern Europe on the Black Sea. That these people thrived as a gateway to Asia for more than a thousand years is both an important historic fact and an exceptional cultural phenomenon that is a great benefit to everyone. After dinner there it was fascinating how their food captured elements of all the Silk Road traffic that brought the food from the far East and West through Tblisi and other ancient cities, leaving their diverse flavors and skills behind. \n\nEverything we sampled reminded of dishes eaten in other cooking styles. The eggplant with walnuts, with its mildly bitter nightshade base and soft sweetness from the ground walnut hummus-like spread, took me to Middle Eastern and Greek houses. The adjaruli bread boat with its tender hot dough split open on top to expose a lake of molten cheese and raw egg, came right from an oven that looked similar to a tandor Indian oven, and easily reminded of an Italian calzone, only more cheesily delicious. Finally, the khinkali soup dumplings were larger versions of Shanghai xiao long bao, complete with steaming beef/pork consume and flavorful filling, and eaten by hand. \n\nWhether it was Marco Polo or Ghengis Khan bringing these ideas on their travels or conquests, or anyone else along the way, this Georgian restaurant continues the culinary exchange between East and West, and is awesome food for both taste buds and anthropologists.",

I was trying to maintain my good mood, but it would be a losing battle without some caffeine soon. \n\nDesperate times called for desperate measures. \n\nI remembered there was this Bambu shop nearby, so I Yelped it and realized it was right across 6th Street from where we were. We walked over and found it in the inner corner of the shopping center. It was a small shop, with short red sofa, three cafe tables, and a few chairs along the window. The walls were covered in menus and photos of their signature Che fruity concoctions. \n\nColorful, but I needed something stronger and hotter. Farther down the drinks list was the coffee. I asked for Vietnamese coffee, hot. I normally drink it in VN cafes or after meals, so this was my first takeout. \n\nIt was exactly as expected. Strong, hot and sweetened by condensed milk. I missed the whole drip experience but it was great to be able to shop the market with java in hand.",

    "text": "Battery Park sits along a stretch of the Delaware River shoreline, beginning at the bottom of Delaware Street in New Castle, and going southwestward for a little over a mile next to Gambacorta Marsh to where Army Creek enters the Delaware.  There are two dikes, one holding back the marsh and the other a former railroad spur line. There is little left of the original battery built to defend against French incursions before the Revolution, and later against the British. Too, the railroad that used to run from where the small white wooden ticket office now stands, all the way to Frenchtown, Maryland, is little more than an historic footnote.  \n\nYet, what remains is a beautiful place to walk or bike along the water's edge and witness some amazing sunsets. There are the remains of the small harbor sticking their waterlogged lumber above the surface of the river in spots, and a few ice piers placed to keep ice from clogging the shipping lanes.  \n\nIt is hard to imagine that New Castle is older than Philadelphia, and was the spot where William Penn first set foot in America to oversee his vast land grant from the king.  But, the harbor here is not very big, and Philadelphia soon became the major port for this region.  Commerce was not sufficient to sustain any significant long term economic growth, although for about 30 years the New Castle & Frenchtown Railroad (the first on the east coast), did help with transport between Philly and Baltimore, because going by boat between the two cities was difficult due to the topography of the Delmarva Peninsula.  Eventually, first canals, and later larger railroads and toll roads assumed the largest share of commercial transport, and New Castle became a literal backwater in time. \n\nYet, without that, Battery Park would likely have been overrun by industrialization and extensive shipping, and not become the lovely green space that natives and visitors enjoy today.",

Which is to say, even though it is one of those mid-20th Century flat roofed  all white ice cream stores, it tends to blend into the background. Still, it is worth the effort to slow down and take a few minutes out of your day to sample their sweet creamies. \n\nThey do vanilla soft serve the way it should be done - taking the time to be sure it is fully blended and chilled before dispensing through their antique equipment. The result is among the best softies I have had the pleasure to explore with my tongue. While Kohr's down the shore remains the gold standard, C & C is just a step behind. Their thing is to add toppings to every cone and dish going out the windows. In my case, it was smashed cherries, although the Jimmies and wet nuts also looked damn good. \n\nThe only downside is the harsh environment surrounding the building. There are no trees, bushes, umbrellas, picnic tables, overhangs, etc., to shelter customers from the blazing sun nor Saharan heat. The choice is to stand around and melt with the ice cream, sit in your car with the air conditioner going full bore, or to drive away and hope when you arrive home your prize hasn't leaked onto the floor. Makes the consumption less than it could be if even a small effort was made to provide some seating in the shade. On a hot and steamy late Sunday afternoon it was quite oppressive.\n\nI guess we could bring a beach umbrella and set it up on the grass behind the shop, but then I would need a sandy beach to make it feel right - and I might as well go down the shore for a Kohr's. \n\n3.5 Stars",

Small public space with a few tables, and the expectation that most people will take their ice cream and leave. \n\nTheir flavors are exotic-sounding, and for the most part they succeed in producing the subtle tastes that are seldom found in ice cream parlors.  My \"Regular\" sized cup of Indonesian Vanilla and Banana Caramel was smooth, creamy and required some attention to appreciate the variations and their mixture on the tongue. \n\nThe sizes are smaller than the competition, and the prices a bit higher, at $5. for two small scoops of whatever flavors you choose. That may be a good thing, as it does suggest slowing down to enjoy the moment over piling on luscious calories. \n\nThe shop is across the parking lot from Big Bear Natural Foods, and people have been known to park there without hassle.",

    "text": "Now that I am spending more time at the USCIS building on 41st Street, and the immigration interviews and other proceedings start as early at 8:00 am, I need a place to cool my jets over coffee or breakfast while I wait to be heard. I learned long ago that it is better to arrive early and wait for court or other meetings, than to deal with heavier traffic later in the morning, and risk arriving late. Today, I asked one of the guards in the security area where to go for coffee until the public was allowed into the building at 7:30.  He was thoughtful and thorough, giving me a list of places within a few blocks.  When he mentioned the restaurant on Market Street that had a full breakfast menu, he showed more enthusiasm then for the others mentioned, so I took my clients there for morning repast.  \n\nTurned out that Hamilton Restaurant is an old school luncheonette, with long counter with spinners on one side, and tables on the other.  Kitchen in back. The offerings were plentiful, with both breakfast and lunch available during open hours.  We opted for a couple of omelets (w/ home fries), turkey sage sausage, egg & cheese on Kaiser roll, and a grilled blueberry muffin.  Ten minutes later we were served by a very friendly and considerate woman, who seemed to anticipate our needs.  That was unexpected and exceptional. \n\nOur food was very good.  The omelets were stuffed to the gills with the cheesesteak and sausage fillings two of them wanted, while my sandwich was not overly large, but very tasty with the turkey sage sausage a surprise star of the show.  Very happy with that recommendation.  The muffin had a strong resemblance to Costco muffins, but there were no complaints. Coffee was strong and the request that one be half milk, well received and delivered. \n\nThis location is beyond the spreading influence of UPenn and Drexel.  That means that it is still an original joint that has not been gentrified yet.  The cozy neighborhood atmosphere was palpable, and the prices reflective of that.  \n\nVery happy to find a place where I can eat and be comfortable while waiting to go to work.",

    "text": "Breakfast Nook is a small morning/afternoon luncheonette in the Borough of Riverton, NJ, right across Bannard Street from the Cinnaminson Light Rail Station very close by the Delaware River. It sits on the first floor of a warehouse-looking building, not normally a place I'd look for breakfast. Still, it is a bright and clean house with a dozen or so tables and counter service toward the rear. \n\nI plopped down on a stool and settled in as a server welcomed me, brought me coffee, milk and a menu. I appreciated the fresh milk availability in lieu of mini moo. The specials board caught my attention with its offer of a sausage, egg and cheese on grilled rye sandwich (with home fries, $7). \n\nIt called my name.\n\nIt was a very good sammy. Crisp, grill toasted bread, with tasty patty, sharp cheddar and still lightly drippy fried egg. Just the way I like it. The home fries were copious, with dark nibs throughout, and just greasy enough for max flavor. Coffee wasn't memorable, but it was hot and bracing on a cool late November morn. \n\nWhile looking around I saw three wooden plates on the wall, each with the name of a restaurant owned by this team. Kelly's Kitchen in Bensalem, PA, Dredge Harbor Cafe in Riverton and Breakfast Nook. I had now eaten in all three, and wondered if there was a prize for this accomplishment. Probably not, but there ought to be at least a cupcake in recognition. \n\nMaybe they'll read this and let me know.",

Once inside it is a long, narrow space with a wall of tables on one side, and the kitchen prep area on the other.  The menu is simple with the usual suspect tacos, burritos, quesadillas and the like, but as soon as I saw they had grilled pork Tortas, I zoned in on that.  \n\nThe Chips and Salsas are self-serve on top of the counter, with a choice of hot and hotter green/red dippers in small plastic containers.  The chips are extra thick and crunchy. The lunch special includes a drink, smooth Black Bean mash, and mildly spicy Rice with kernels of corn mixed in. Both, tasty and textural accompaniments.  The Torta arrived - an oversized fresh roll stuffed with Grilled Pork, Lettuce, Tomato, Melty Cheese, Hot Sauce, and Chipotle Mayo dressing, half-wrapped in foil to hold it together and allow for pick up without mess.  Under $7.\n\nThe chew was a robust mix of hot and cold, sweet and spicy, chewy and compliant; a very tasty and intriguing eat.  The only note of caution is when removing the foil to attack the rest of the sandwich, remember that the sauce inside can leak and drip, and even dampen the bread.  You don't want that causing a trip to the cleaners. \n\nOtherwise, a totally satisfying experience that I am very likely to repeat.",

Although dressed up like a pizza parlor on the outside, there is a comfortable dining room within, with large wall murals of Venice, and a menu that covers most of the traditional Roman dishes, plus a few custom designed in house.  To my pleasant surprise, everything we ordered was first rate.  \n\nWe went with two chicken platters; Parmegano and Valentino, with side of pasta and nice sized green salad. Both consisted of three breast fillets. The Parmegano was olive oil pan saut\u00e9ed bread crumb covered in thick chunky red sauce, with a mildly salty and basil flavor, covered with melted mozza. It was tender and filling. Our request that the pasta side be done Alfredo was granted, and after a shake or two of black pepper, it was excellent as a complement to the main course. Similarly, the Valentino was laid over with freshly cut mushrooms and steamed asparagus, and a light cream sauce. The veggies were still crisp, while the chicken cut easily with a fork. The white sauce was mellow and perfect for the combination of other flavors and textures. It was very different than the Alfredo sauce, showing the skill of the chef in preparing each separately as ordered. The aglio olio penne pasta in the side bowl was likewise delicious.  We were very impressed how each dish was so remarkably distinct and fun to eat. \n\nService was friendly and prompt, but also not fawning nor overdone. This was still Levittown, after all. \n\nThis is the second or third superior meal we have scored on Emilie Road, and it is unlikely to be the last.  It is so worth exploring this neighborhood, especially when it is obvious that there is no loss of quality along with the appreciated loss of expense. \n\nYordana's is worth the trip.",

It is the fish restaurant project undertaken by the proprietor of the Ewing Diner, a traditional Greek stainless palace nearby.\n\n The space is nicely renovated, but retains the familiarity of its beginnings with marble lunch counter and enormous slices of dessert cakes, pies and puddings. The service folk looked vaguely like the old staff at The Extension, but as it was many years since my last visit, I wasn't sure if we were all just older versions of our previous selves. They were well schooled in taking care of customers and made certain I had all the water and oven heated rolls I wanted.\n\nI walked in after 3 and was hungry enough for dinner after skipping lunch and an early breakfast. I saw Flounder Francais on the Specials Menu, and stopped reading. As a Francais Fanatic there was nothing more to consider. Let's see what these guys could do with a favorite dish. \n\nThe side Caesar Salad was big and fresh, but lacked anchovy based dressing. The small Dinner Rolls were excellent right from the oven with a tasty herb butter melting into them. The large plate with a bed of yellow rice under Flounder fillet dipped in egg and lightly sauteed in more butter, lemon and white wine was flakey and tender and seemed to have avoided freezer time.\n\n Its only shortcoming was caused by my expectation that it would be an Italian or French style finish with a pan sautee browning and thin lemon wine butter reduction. Rather, it was a much heavier bright yellow Greek gravy that was more a thick Avgolemono soup, than the delicate tart complement to the flounder. It wasn't bad, but just not what I envisioned.\n\nThat will remind me to live in the moment and leave expectations behind where they can't influence what's yet to come.",

    "text": "Before I was ready to write a review, I needed a refresher on the geography and history of Uzbekistan, the Central Asian nation surrounded by other \"stans;\" its cities of Tashkent, Samarkand and Bukara, some of the Pearls along the Silk Road from Istanbul to Xian, China, made famous by the epic journeys of Marco Polo.  I had visited Tashkent on business some years ago, and remembered it as very old and mysterious; full of mosques and museums - and especially, gem markets where trade in rare colored crystals and semi-precious stones, kept me excited, curious and negotiating for days at a time.  \n\nAnd, the food was equally excellent.  So, when we decided on impulse to have dinner at Chaikhana on Bustleton Avenue last weekend, it was with a sense of remembered delicacies and dinners that went on for hours into the wee hours of the morning; with too much local alcohol and toasts to everything under the sun and moon.  This was one of those friction points between two cultures, where each was influenced by the other.  Here it meant people who looked Asian, but spoke Russian and various dialects.  A place where Buddha was said to have travelled, and Islam flourished.  \n\nThis shop is not typical Philly.  It announces itself loudly by occupying a large house fronting the busy Bustleton, and having a large enclosed patio in front, wrapped in plastic to maintain temperature, and lit by tiny white lights encased in miniature trees on each table.  No reservation was required this Sunday night, as we were seated on the end of a large table big enough for six.  This porch was occupied by a few large parties celebrating happiness, which naturally took a lot of attention to service well.  We still had enough of our gracious server's help to understand the menu with wise suggestions as to the dishes to mix without going overboard.  Her suggestions were right on, as each plate was loaded with enough for two people, and ordering as we would in another restaurant would have been overkill here.\n\nWe started with mushroom soup and bread.  One order was enough for both of us, and it was served in two bowls.  It had several fungal varieties in a rich and savor base stock.  Maybe a tad oily, but very flavorful and excellent.  The round loaf of bread was a very pleasant surprise.  It had a thick and chewy texture, and both a salty and sweet flavor.  It was amazing.  A smear of butter, or a sponging of the soup or gravies, made it the perfect complement for whatever was eaten.  \n\nTwo apps were also shared.  The Cheburek, a deep fried folded over dough filled with spicy ground beef, potato, onions and a few mysteries, was richly textured, smooth and delicious. The other escapes me at the moment, but it was round, plump and baked. Loved it.  Our main entre was a chicken and lamb kabob, both of which were cooked to their apex of tenderness and flavor, with onion slices on the side.  They were both wonderful, and again, enough for us to share.  We ate well while those around us celebrated to the max.  It was fun to watch and listen.  \n\nWe were full before dessert, although very tempted by the cherry Vareniki and honey cake.  \n\nThere was plenty left unexplored on this visit.  But, like Marco Polo, many more trips to this part of Uzbekistan are anticipated.",

    "text": "Just ordered a 16 piece fried chicken bucket from Chicken Holiday on Olden Avenue Extension in Ewing, NJ. After calling it in, I drove there on my way home, and arrived just as it was coming out of the pressure fryer. It looked dark bronze and the odor of the steam being released went right to my head, and made me feel a bit intoxicated. \n\nNothing wrong with that!\n\nI watched as the cook removed the chicken and transferred it to an aluminum tray for safe travel. I counted the pieces with him, and think my package carried 17 total. I appreciated the extra generosity. He then wrapped the tray in foil, and tore open the top dome to allow the condensation to escape. In turn, that was placed in a heavy gauge brown paper sack, and again split open at the top for additional moisture release. \n\nBy the time I arrived home, I was nearly overcome by the aroma enveloping the car. I decided to sample a wing while still hot and wait for the family before consuming more. First bite encountered crisp skin, followed by warm white meat and a pleasant clean oil fried chicken flavor. I nibbled and sucked all the meat from them bones, and I selfishly considered grabbing a plump breast for a long moment. \n\nNah! It would be more fun to indulge with the fam. So, I waited. \n\nAn hour later we were sitting around the kitchen table with sides of homemade mashed potatoes and green salad as excellent complementary pieces to a very happy meal. \n\nA star is missing because truth be told, the chicken was a tad overdone. A lighter golden copper finish would have made it perfect. Turns out that as much as I love the color bronze, it is past prime when it comes to fried chicken excellence. Still very good texture and taste, but with a subtle aftertaste that missed the mark. \n\nIn fried chicken, even a seconds can make a big difference.",

    "text": "I've had this Chase credit card since 1985.  When the new card arrived to replace the expiring one, I dutifully made the required call to activate it.  Little did I know I would be entering the Bizarro world of \"Verification.\"\n\nMy call was transferred to a human being because their system did not recognize me.  I was told that they did not have my Social Security number, nor anything else in their records to identify me! \n\nWhat?!\n\nThirty years in the system and suddenly I did not exist.  They had issued the card originally with some required information. They no longer had it.  They had sent me the renewal, but had no way for me to use it.  I had become a digital phantom. \n\nMy deduction was that my identity had been dumped or lost in a security breach, and now to be sure I was not one of the bad guys, I had to justify my existence.  How, you ask?  By going to a bricks and mortar bank branch and introducing myself to a bank officer with some backup credentials.  \n\nThe story has a happy (if time wasting) ending.  I went into this branch today and met with one of their suits.  He was very nice and sat me down in his cubicle to review the facts and call the Chase verification center.  A five minute conversation ensued with an exchange of information with HQ, which resulted in my identity being accepted, and the card useable.  \n\nFor the humorous professionalism demonstrated by SB (shall remain nameless), and his cutting through the BS and bringing my identity back online, I am a true fan of this gentleman and the bank branch he represents.",

    "text": "Thai Chef & Noodle Fusion is located on a dreary strip of Rt. 1 (Lincoln Highway) in Penndel.  The effort to bring new life is taking shape with a few new restaurants in a two block area.  This place is one of its anchors, and is a pioneer there over several years.  \n\nThe shop has a casual air, much more laid back and cozy than it appears from outside.  The tables on one side are separated by privacy screens made up of thin branches and curtains.  The outer wall has carved wooden folding screens that can be opened to extend for more separation.  Nice touch.  The staff is friendly, informative and prompt.  This is primarily a Thai house, although the name and menu offer alternatives in Japanese and Chinese cuisine.  I join the other reviewers in skepticism that \"fusion\" is a reality as opposed to a marketing gimmick.  I have only tried the Thai dishes as the owners and chef are Thai, and they come by this style honestly - they live it. \n\nI had a lunch special which is a combination of a choice of cup of soup, app, and entre.  I chose the Tum Yom Soup, Moon Dumplings, and Drunken Noodles with Chicken.  The soup had the strong taste of lemongrass and mild chili with ample slices of chicken and veggies.  I enjoyed it.  The Moon Dumplings were a pleasant surprise.  While small and lightly fried, they were loaded with ground mushrooms and possessed a nice earthy flavor, and absorbed the hot chili oil/sauce well.  The Drunken Noodles were very good, with the right ratio of broad noodles to veggies and chicken and a decent sauce.  It was a little bland so I asked for chili flakes to liven it up.  I was brought a shaker of finely ground orange pepper that was a perfect complement to the dish and brought it to the heat level I wanted.  Some joints don't have the right spice and offer only Sriracha, which, while hot, does not blend well and distribute evenly over most foods.  Thai Chef had what was needed.  \n\nI can't comment on the \"fusion\" aspects, but I was very satisfied with my Thai lunch here.  I know that I look forward to more visits, and that makes me a fan.\n\nAugust 10, 2014 - I have had dinner here a couple of times recently.  If anything, the dinners are superior to the lunch deals.  Last night I sampled their \"Jungle King\" and \"Cashew\".  The names themselves were unique. Both were nice portions of fresh veggies, tofu, chicken, with a nice mix of spices, including ginger and a sweetish curry, and large cashews on one.  An order of House Fried Rice rounded out the meal, while leaving enough to take home for today's lunch.  \n\nThe vibe continues to relax and encourage lingering.  The fact that the owners are Thai helps bring the authenticity home.",

    "text": "Folcroft Diner sits on Chester Pike (Rt. 13) in the northern panhandle of the borough by that name in Delaware County, PA. Before the interstate was completed, it and Rt.1 were the primary roads north and south between Philly and Baltimore. Driving it last Friday on the way back from UDel to Bucks County due to jammed traffic on Rt. I 95, was an historic tour of yesteryear America when roadside attractions were often the best part of a family car trip to the intended destination. \n\nCruising north with son after school was declared closed for classes for the remainder of the spring semester, it was natural to reflect on the drive with my parents between New York and Washington when I was a student in D.C. Felt like an unfortunate right of passage to be experiencing this due to the curse of COVID-19. \n\nThe diner was the perfect stage for a lunch stop to stretch and grab a quick bite of Americana. A cup of New England Clam Chowder and Petty Melt (medium, fries, slaw & pickle slices), were the way to go. Our booth was comfy, our server friendly and attentive, and the space around us sufficient to allow us to feel socially distanced. We considered whether restaurants would remain open for sit down business in the days and weeks ahead. If this was to be a last meal in the Age of COVID-19, then we would soberly celebrate the moment and pray our angels protected us. \n\nThe chowder was thick creamy and loaded with diced clam. The cup was very filling and more than enough for a sample. The burger was a half pounder, finished as desired, bracketed by quality rye toast, melted Swiss and filled with sauteed onions and mushrooms. A long red squirt of Heinz Ketchup and I had a fun, satisfying meal. I could only down half, and took the rest home. Prices were surprisingly reasonable for the quality and quality of the plates served, almost like the menu was printed in the last century. \n\nMaybe it was.",

    "text": "Al's Airport Inn has come a long way from its dive bar existence in the last quarter of the 20th Century. What was once a place only lone drinkers and cheaters could love, it has moved more uptown into a comfortable local bar with a pretty good kitchen. Son and I dropped in last night for dinner, and were duly impressed. \n\nWe ordered Al's wings and two burgers, along with draft Miller Lites (There isn't much in the way of crafties here). The wings were very good, and justify their reputation. Crisp, meaty, and spicy without being volcanic. At 10 for $10, reasonably priced. Happy hour provides a $2 discount. The burgers were freshly ground and shaped in house. Although we requested medium finish, they were both well done. That could be because the chef was doubling as a waiter and not attentive enough at the grill. Still, with a little more seasoning they could have been very good. Superior brioche style bun held together to the end. \n\nAl's accepts credit cards now, which is a big deal in opening their market to more of the public. It did appear that they didn't have much experience with them, as the original bill was not returned with the credit card invoice for signing, making it impossible to compare for accuracy. Better practice to do so. \n\nOverall, Al's is vastly improved over its past life. Haunted or not, it is no longer a dive bar, and is a nice place to hang out.\n\n3.5 STARS",

    "text": "Sofra is a Turkish caf\u00e9 on Bristol Pike in Levittown, Pa.  It doesn't look like much from the outside, with small stature in a rather unattractive part of Bucks County, but grab some courage and go inside.  Within, you will find a small dining room, with open floor space for entertainment.  Most important, the chef knows a thing or two about Istanbul cuisine.  \n\nOur Saturday jaunt to a commercial area nearby resulted in us stopping in to check out what was going on here.  We were greeted by a gentlemen I took to be an owner, owing to his general lack of social grace. Why else would he be handling guests?  Still, we sat to one side and were brought menus and cold water.  I am no maven when it comes to Turkish kitchens, but Middle Eastern chow I know something about from time spent in the eastern Mediterranean.  \n\nI was looking for lamb gyro as an introduction to the skill here, but it was not available for lunch.  So, I looked further and found Shepherd's Salad, Falafel and Grilled Lamb in Pita Sandwich as attractive alternatives.  All arrived about ten minutes later in the hands of our erstwhile host.  The Salad was a plentiful pile of Tomato, Cucumber, Black Olive, Red Onion and a nice Olive Oil based herbed dressing.  Very refreshing. The Falafel Plate was 5 nice sized balls of ground chickpea and herbs, deep fried to a medium brown finish, with a stainless bowl of Tahini Sauce in the middle.  Wedge Tomato and Lettuce garnish.  Liked it!  Finally, the Grilled Lamb wrapped tightly in pita and again in paper, was excellent, with a rich BBQ-like flavor and more lettuce, onion and a wonderful savory taste.  Star of the show. \n\nWe weren't asked if we wanted dessert or Turkish coffee (we did), but were handed the check as soon as we finished eating our mains.  I guess we weren't on the guest list, even being the only customers in the house.  \n\nToo bad, because Sofra has potential.",

    "text": "Eleven of us showed up at 10:30 for a Dim Sum experience in Philadelphia Chinatown last Saturday.  I had selected Ocean City Restaurant on the north end of 9th Street from Yelp reviews.  A little out of the way. A lot more available tables than other similar banquet halls closer to the center of CTown. \n\nWe were met near the front door by the owner/manager, who at first thought there were only two of us.  He was gracious, even knowing we could not eat enough to make his day.  Then, we explained there were actually nine more right behind us.  His face registered the glint of happy surprise as he swiveled and pointed to the large round table in the front corner with exactly eleven chairs around it.  Now, he was very happy, and walked with us and set up the lazy Susan in the middle of the table as we all gathered 'round.  Maybe, we would help his bottom line.  \n\nIndeed, we did.\n\nAs the cart ladies approached, the titular hostess of this feast arose and began to order for everyone.  Nothing random here.  She pointed and placed, requested and demanded, served and bussed, and made sure everyone had an equal amount of every dish desired.  Truly, an amazing display of taking charge, and improving the experience.  She has a future in the hosting business.  \n\nIf you check the photos, you will see that we sampled a large amount of what Ocean City had to offer.  Everything was good to exceptional for dim sum.  Special mention to the Minced Pork Congee, Tofu Skin with Veggies, and the Seafood Dumplings.  Tasty and fun.  We didn't try everything, but enjoyed what we had, with even the rookies fully engaged.  We left enough on the menu for another visit.  \n\nIt always surprises me how much food you get at a dim sum, and for what a fair price.  Eleven of us (9 adults), gorged for under $150, and even brought a few things home.  \n\nOcean City is a traditional seafood house that does a splendid Hong Kong style 'small plates'.  Can't speak to the regular menu, but they do dim sum the old fashioned way. Full floor show. Totally satisfied.\n\nKeep it coming!",

    "text": "Smith's Ace Hardware is an extension of Yardville Supply, a serious regional provider of all home improvement merchandise, geared for the professional contractor set more than the general public. Their Ace ventures attempt to overcome that marketing disadvantage by fitting a niche between big box highway warehouses and mom & pop corner retail hardware shops. \n\nIn Newtown, they compete with the historic Newtown Hardware on State Street in the Borough, which has been in business for over one hundred years. So, the disparity between shopping old and shopping new could not be greater. Ace is larger and has superior inventory as a result, but lacks the community roots and hands on experience of the museum-like NHH. They don't really compete on price, because they are both more expensive than the big boxes. \n\nSo, whether you want to buy self piercing screws or replacement screens to patch the originals on your back porch, depends on your feeling about local vs. corporate enterprise. You wouldn't go to either if price was your primary focus, as Home Depot and Lowes are both cheaper. But, if keeping local businesses afloat is important to you, the choice is a closer call. This Ace is owned by a Jersey company and is limited to a small region in NJ and PA. It provides local jobs to help the economy. Yet, if you like a dose of true history when you are looking for small pieces to complete a home project, and love to rummage through old wooden drawers full of nails, screws, and electrical parts, Newtown Hardware has you covered. \n\nThe choice is yours.",

    "text": "Riverfront Market is a glorified food court housed in a redeveloped brick and beam warehouse on the banks of the Christina River in Wilmington, DE. It was built under the auspices of the state funded Riverfront Development Corporation in the late 1990s. It is an interesting destination in a part of town that was weed filled lots and dilapidated buildings prior to the large investment of taxpayer funds. It is much better to reestablish a functional, economically viable commercial center than to leave it forgotten and abandoned. \n\nThe mix of dining choices comes from all locally owned food outlets of varying ethnicity, including, Mexican, Thai, Italian, cheesesteak and Korean green grocer. New kitchens are taking the place of those that have not survived. With hours from 6 to 6, it is primarily a lunch choice, with only the Mexican place open for business when I arrived at 4 on a Friday. The rest were already locked down, or being cleaned and straighten in preparation for the next day. \n\nThe building is historically attractive, a pleasant place to walk around or sit at the many tables around the retail space or the second story open balconies. I was the only customer in the house and had time to explore before and after eating my tacos carnitas. It was disappointing that they were unable to sustain their businesses the entire day, but the market has made it this far (with possible subsidies), and the city and state should assure that it can continue to attract people to this part of town.",

Given the hour, I went with a single slice of Traditional Pizza with Sweet Sausage, and a drink.  \n\nGood choice, as the slice was larger than average.  I asked for it \"well done,\" and that was what I received.  Upon lifting off the large attractively orange plate, I was immediately impressed that despite its size and extra weight from the topside, the point held firm and high with nary a quiver.  First bite was a full blown crunch through cheese, sauce and meat; all of which were received warmly with pleasure in my mouth.  It was a very good slice of pizza, despite being reheated.  \n\nWith this lunch coming in under $5. I was very satisfied with the experience, and will not be a stranger to Sal's.

Stick to traditional recipes, offer generous helpings and keep price within reason, and it will take off once Covid restrictions are in the rearview. \n\nIf my first exposure to their kitchen is any indication, they are on their way. They need to open their dining room to customers, and the rest is baked in. We ordered their \"Make Your Own\" dinners of 1) Country Fried Steak, roasted carrots & baked beans, and 2) Crab Cakes, bread stuffing, gravy and candied yams; with slice of carrot cake as shared dessert. It was all pretty darned good, except for the carrot cake. Allow me to elaborate. \n\nThe fried steak was a thin prefab ground patty, nicely fried and drowned in that white gravy. Nice texture and taste, with the gravy not too heavy on the tongue. The sides were a well made complement. Same with the crab cake. Crisp edges with crumbly crab with a little breading to bind them together, but with a dominant crustacean taste. We didn't use those little packages or tartar sauce, as there was enough flavor without them. The yams were sweet, but the bread stuffing was a bit dry and was not resuscitated by the gravy. Yet skipping the stuffing left a still very enjoyable meal. \n\nWord to the wise - Don't over sell a dessert that is past its prime. I was asked if I wanted dessert, and since it was brought to my attention, allowed myself to be upsold because I do love carrot cake as a general proposition. This wayward slice was the exception that proved the rule. It was smallish,  without much cake nor cream cheese icing. It was also noticeably dried out from too much shelf time. Definitely not the place to end a successful meal. It just wasn't worth the calories nor sugar kick. I don't mind being upsold when the product is worthwhile, but when it is a disappointment, it is self defeating. \n\nAlmost lost me there, but decided the rest of the meal was good enough to warrant partially overlooking that mistake. \n\n3.5 STARS",

Her assistant worked the grill and constructed my lunch with a pile of hot pork on a kaiser roll. It was handed to me in a paper boat with small tubs of pickled jalapeno slices and white horseradish. Napkins and other necessities were on the side table to the left; drinks in two portable coolers on the ground to the right. \n\nI drove home and demolished the porker at my kitchen table. It was a thick, juicy mother. All pale tender thin moist sliced roaster, without a lick of fat nor dryness. It was awesome, although the roll was a few minutes past prime.

Perhaps because of that Barry's inventory was pretty much threadbare. All I saw were a few chunks of Crumb Cake, Jewish Apple Cake, and somethings that looked like fruit topped cupcakes. The woman working the counter was friendly and answered my questions about what was left and smoothly packed up my order of two Crumb Cakes into a white paper bag. \n\nMy sense was that as soon as her meagre stock was gone, so was she. If she had been willing to sell that apple cake by the wedge, rather than requiring the whole kubboodle go at once, I would have been happy to grab a handful.

I couldn't trust myself not to dive in and fist large handfuls into my mouth like the 8 year old kid lurking within would do. \n\nI did more calmly sample a piece of the Crumb Cake on the way after stopping at Poppy's Cafe for hot coffee to wash it down.

    "text": "My son and I were looking for a light dinner and decided to try Greenstraw Smoothies on Sycamore Street, the main drag in Newtown, Bucks County.  It is a new place on the nicely redeveloped commercial district.  \n\nThe menu consists of a long list of healthy drinks with fresh fruits and veggies, along with nutritional supplements to suit your particular need - Maca, Hemp protein, Flax Seed, Chia, Spirulina, Wheatgrass Juice, etc.  The foundation of the smoothies are cow milk alternatives like Almond or Coconut Milk, Yogurt, and Fruit Juices.  The combinations are surprisingly refreshing and tasty.  \n\nI ordered a Leo's Favorite, consisting of Almond Milk, Apple Juice, Banana, Peanut Butter, Strawberries, Raspberries, and Greens.  The resultant reddish blend was thick and smooth, but simply sucked through a straw (Yes. It was green). It was a pleasure to imbibe.  My son had The Mango Tree, with Coconut Milk, Mango Juice, Banana, Mango Pieces, Pineapple, and Greens.  The mix came out a ruddy greenish mash that was also quite good.  We both smiled on first drought, and sampled each others drinks.  \n\nI was definitely satisfied with my liquid dinner and was not hungry again last night. Young man needed a bit more sustenance after finishing his homework.  \n\nThis is definitely a worthy spot for a healthy drink.  The prices are reasonable at $5.75 for the middle sized concoction, which was quite filling. \n\nThere is also fair trade coffee available, but that will wait for another day. \n\nGood luck, Greenstraw.",

    "text": "We had a great La Villa Traditional Square Pizza here last week. I had forgotten how delicious their pies were. It was loaded with peppers, onions, mushrooms and sausage, and baked to a wonderful crispy crust(see photo). Service was also friendly and prompt. The black clad servers certainly kept a certain 21 year old family member entertained. \n\nHowever, the app special Crab Cake was drenched in a cheesy white sauce that overwhelmed the titular star of the show to such an extent that the crabbiness of the crustacean was lost.  The big Greek Salad while plentiful lacked imagination and an impressive dressing.  I would not ask for either of those again. \n\nBut, in the end it is all about the pie.  La Villa's are vastly superior to any of its nearby competitors, and can stand their own with some of the best across the river in Jersey or Philly. \n\nHappily, it is much closer in Morrisville, in a nicely appointed renovated Pizza Hut structure in the middle of a strip mall parking field off Pennsylvania Avenue.",

    "text": "I can't speak to the authenticity of their German cuisine, because I was just there for breakfast, but I certainly enjoyed what I had for my morning meal. \n\nSitting at the bar under the huge head of a taxidermy moose, with large steins high on a shelf, I was surprised by the extensive breakfast menu.  Tracy, the manager/server in the barroom, was cordial, but gave me time and space to decide what to eat, after bringing me a mug of coffee and side cordial glass of milk. Nice touch! \n\nI went with their, \"Mini Vacation in Paris.\" You guessed it - a short stack of french toast with two extra plump pork sausages. After doctoring everything with butter and Smucker's syrup, I went to work. It was all pretty good, with good flavor packed into the two slices of white, and extra pleasant taste emanating from the bangers. It would have been even better with maple syrup, but at a price under $8 for everything, I am not complaining. \n \nCoffee was refilled without asking, and I was even given the TV remote to watch whatever I chose on the corner monitor. That was a first, and even though I preferred to catch up on my reading, I appreciated the generous offer. \n\nIf I find myself out that way again, I would def stop in to discover more of the morning possibilities. I bet Tracy has some stories to tell.",

    "text": "On the dreary stretch of Rt. 1 (Lincoln Highway) in Fairless Hills, Pa., sits a solitary Colonel Sanders, aka, KFC. \n\nI have customered it a few times over the years.  Each time the parking lot was nearly empty, and the dining area bereft of fried chicken lovers.  Hitchcockian if pushed for a description, with an orange neon sign on the wall saying it was \"Sunday dinner every night.\"  Yet, the actual meals were good, and the Honey BBQ wings way better than average due in part to their initial preparation as Buffalo Wings, then lathered with the thick sweet tang of the Honey BBQ recipe, giving the wings a hot sweet sallow flavor that can lead to compulsive eating disorders.  The Original Recipe Buckets are also quite good, especially for feeding teenage boys coming together for a party.\n\nThus, my reason for being there late last week, as I waited for the order to be packed and bagged.  I was surprised when the bucket of 20 pieces and box of 20 wings came in over $40., but nothing is too good for my now teenage son.  \n\nMy car smelled of greasy BBQ on the ride home, and it tortured my saliva glands so much that I nearly pulled over to put one of those rusty red chicken wings in my mouth.  I overcame that impulse and made it home in 20 minutes. As soon as I entered the house, my son, his friends, and a couple of parents became transfixed at the aroma, and silently rose to follow me into the dining room.  Shades of Night of the Living Dead. \n\nThe entire batch was devoured in a half hour, and there were sated smiles all around. I am convinced that a chemical analysis of the chicken coating would turn up crack in the mix.  It was that good. \n\nHave to be careful as this stuff is quickly addictive, but so damn yummy.",

    "text": "Solstice, the nouveau cuisine restaurant recently opened in the Village @ Newtown Shopping Center, bring something attractive and creative to the fairly standard kitchens that are crowding into town recently. Its space is open and bright, with high ceilings and the feel of a summer home at the beach on a sunny summer day. Walking in for our reservation immediately shifted my attitude from just another dinner, to the possibility of something transformative. It was that beautiful and unexpected. \n\nThe staff was equal to the environment, and took great care of us from seating to, \"Thanks for coming. Hope to see you again soon.\" Likewise, the menu offerings were seasonal, with many vegetarian oriented appetizers and entrees. The summer listings were a cross between colorful blends of meat and leaf, pasta and creative takes on traditional dishes. We went with Lobster Risotto, Filet (medium well), Braised Waygu Short Rib & Mashed, and Sweet Corn Ricotta Gnocchi. I also sampled the Cantelope Gazpacho to broaden our exposure to their kitchen. \n\nThe result was less than perfection, but strong enough to appreciate what the chef was trying to do to separate Solstice from the ragtag assortment of other houses in the neighborhood. Special merit to the Gazpacho, which was just a delicious cold soup on an extremely hot day. In fact, it was the best thing brought to our table. \n\nThe Risotto was visually stunning with the yellow rice base and orange lobster, but not the most tasty rendition available for these ingredients. Liked it. Didn't love it. The Filet was mild pink throughout as described by our server, yet somewhat thinner than anticipated and less flavorful than hoped. Admittedly, my stepson may have been influenced by the same cut he ordered last week at Rocco's, which knocked his socks off. This slab was certainly less overwhelming, but still decent. It just suffered by comparison. \n\nThe Short Rib was perfectly cooked and was again a stunning visual presentation. The sauce could have used more zip, as it had the texture/flavor of American roast beef, rather than accentuating the Waygu or the many Asian or citrus spices that could have made this dish sing. In the same way, the Gnocchi was tender and mixed very well with the veggies and shaved cheese, but had a excess of water at the bottom of the deep plate and was a bit salty. As you can tell, everything was good to excellent, but each left something to be desired. \n\nThere will be a next time, but our approach will be to treat Solstice as a tapas house. We will order several appetizers, rather than entrees, and enjoy tasting many more of their creative dishes. The Gazpacho was the best we tried, and the hummus and other small plates seemed to have potential as we scanned the other tables for reactions to the food. I suspect, without knowing, that this may be the way to go.",

It has both packaged and loose herbs for most known (and many unknown to western culture) ailments.  The owner and employees are quite knowledgeable at understanding your symptoms and making informed suggestions for treatment.  \n\nI observed as several customers described their physical problems, were questioned by the herbalists, and finally reached a thoughtful solution.  Then, the chief lay sheets of clean paper on the counter and began to place various herbs, roots, and barks onto each of them in approximately equal amounts before wrapping each carefully, and placing them in separate bags; one for each dosage - usually a strong tea.  Fascinating!\n\nI was there for fresh, sliced American Ginseng to help stimulate my energy level, and an herbal patch for a friend with Plantar's Fasciitis.  Securing both after enjoying the cultural display rarely seen outside of the Chinatown's of the USA, I left with confidence in my new elixirs.\n\nThis place seems to move substantial volume, and it is a safe bet that their products are fresher than those sometimes found in stores that sell a multitude of other things.",

    "text": "Zara's Food Cart although on wheels and with a hitch for getting on the road, is a permanent fixture of the Riggins gas station on Street Road, Bensalem, PA. Its lime green paint job makes it easy to see on the southbound side. The menu is limited to gyros and over rice options in lamb, chicken or beef Afghani style faire. From what I saw and tasted, its popularity is well founded. \n\nMy son turned me on to it on our way back from a day visiting Delaware, and just describing his experience there made us hungry to try it. So, we got off RT. 95 and cruised up Street Road a mile or so until we found it. About 4 parking spaces in proximity, but all we needed was one. The cart is tiny which explains the absence of room for refrigerated drinks. Only a small person could work in such tight conditions. Zara be that guy.\n\nMy lamb Gyro was excellent. A ton of well cut and grilled seasoned lamb, with lettuce, tomato, cucumber and garlicy white sauce, in a soft, thick pita, wrapped in sandwich paper and aluminum foil. It was still hot and delicious when we got home. My son's chicken and rice was similarly loaded. He couldn't wait and scarfed it down in the car. \n\nHad Zara had room for vertical grills, shaved the meat off the spit, and set up a few picnic tables to permit dining on site, this would have been a full five star adventure. As it was it was pretty darn close. \n\nThis one is worth going back to.",

    "text": "The \"New & Improved\" Village @ Newtown is slowly getting up to speed and opening the many restaurants that suddenly find this community simply irresistibly. Chipotle Mexican Grill is the latest to have its grand opening in the new complex across from McCaffrey's Supermarket. \n\nLuckily the parking lot was completed on time, too, so there is plenty of parking available for it now, and hopefully when the other five kitchens are open for business at the same time. Walking in, the room is smaller than anticipated, with several high communal tables for people to eat & run. It wasn't so busy when I was there around 3:30. The assembly line concept seemed efficient, but I was causing a slowdown by asking too many questions. I'm generally not a fan of this approach to dining, so I needed instruction on some of the basics. In the end, a carne asada burrito was delivered to me at the end of the line - stuffed with brown rice, pinto beans, carne asada, queso, avocado and a few other things. It was stuffed to the gills with sour cream on the side. I took it home somewhat concerned the whole thing would explode, it was packed so tight! \n\nIt was a tasty package with so many things going on that it all blended together in my mouth. Definitely a four napkin meal. I enjoyed it, although I could only finish half. As two meals the $11 tag seemed quite reasonable. \n\nI can see what people like about Chipotle. It uses fresh ingredients, is basically healthy with a little self control, and you can fit it into a lunch hour. But, if authenticity in Mexican cuisine is paramount for you, this burrito was no where near as delicious as can be found in any good Casa Mexicana elsewhere in Bucks and Montgomery Counties, or across the river in Trenton. \n\nI wish them success in Newtown.",

    "text": "This review addresses two subjects; the BK App and the new Ch'King Chicken Sandwich. While the first lacks intuitive feel and is frustratingly obtuse, the later is a damned good attempt to compete with all the other clucker on brioche buns coming to fast food franchises around the country. \n\nThe app offers many benefits not available to walk-in/drive-in customers. There are free Whoppers with first Ch'King purchases, discounted sides and drinks as \"points\" are accumulated, and surprise gifts with purchase on a regular basis. Today, it was vanilla soft-serve in a cone or cup when buying something of $3 or more price. So, there are pleasant upsides if you like the BK menu and can navigate the app. \n\nEasier said then done.\n\nI found that the special offers didn't always appear on the app from use to use. It wasn't obvious, therefore, which deals were present, and which expired. I found myself repeatedly returning to the opening page as I tried to work my way through the process. I ultimately got the ordering completed with what I wanted, but the time waste was a pain in the butt. If not for my curiosity and persistence, I would have deleted the app and driven to Popeye's instead. \n\nYet, it turned out that the new Ch'King standard chicken sandwich was very good (I left the free Whopper for my son to devour). The breast was plump, juicy, well breaded/fried, and all quite tasty. The brioche roll was fresh and held together to the last bite. The special sauce was the flavor of mild mayo,tartar, perhaps a bit of Sriracha, and the pickle slices pleasantly sour and crisp. The Sammy was so thick that my jaws couldn't open wide enough to fit it in for my incisors to clamp down,without squeezing it together and shimmying it back and forth to slowly gain necessary placement between my dents. \n\nI chose onion rings over fries, and thought they were a decent alternative, although more calories. \n\nThis Ch'king falls just shy of the Popeye's version, but ahead of Chik Fil-A, Wendy's and McDonald's iterations in terms of taste, texture, composition and fun. Too, it is competitive with the smaller chicken shops like Lovebird, at a better price. For someone who prefers chicken to burgers as a protein source, this is clearly a reasonable and satisfying way to go.",

    "text": "To be honest, bubble tea is lost on me. I have tried it several times when thirsty walking around one Chinatown or another, but never really found it all that good. Usually too sweet, and those tapioca balls on the bottom were an unpleasant semi firm gooey tooth sticky choking hazard. I never understood the attraction. \n\nSo, when Hi Tea Bar opened on State Street in Newtown it was surprising, but not particularly interesting to me. Yet, I passed it every day and the urge to Yelp about it eventually drove my curiosity. Longer story short, I stopped in today to check it out. \n\nWalking in (the front door opens outwards), the shop was narrow and deep with service area behind high wall on the right, and tables Covid-spaced along the left. It was a bit incongruous seeing only local high school girls behind the counter when all prior experience had been a totally Asian tone. I had a brief conversation with the cashier/order taker and sat down at an open table at the front window waiting for the Popcorn Chicken and Peach Green Tea to arrive. This would be my lunch today. \n\nThe tea got there first, followed by a handled plastic bag with the chicken inside with plastic fork and small container of spicy dipping sauce. Not exactly an environmentally neutral package. Similarly, the peach green tea was in plastic, but very tasty and refreshing. I think they mixed liquid fruit extract in with the green iced tea. I really liked it alot. The chicken was cut in small pieces, coated in breadcrumbs and deep fried. As I didn't smell anything cooking, I guessed it was premade and heated in a microwave. Not soft/crunchy like popcorn, but still texturally satisfying, with decent flavor  enhanced by the dipping sauce, I was enjoying an interesting snack. \n\nOverall, a pretty good light meal and drink that differed greatly from standard American fare. Worthwhile even without the bubbles. \n\nWhen Covid is over, Hi Tea Bar management will hopefully be less wasteful with materials, but continue to create enjoyable teas, smoothies and snacks that will have a permanent place in our local economy, right in the heart of town.",

What looks like a typical pizza parlor designed primarily for take out, is in fact a comfortable and attractive dining experience.  Just walk past the counter into the rear dining room, and be transported to a curbside caf\u00e9 in Napoli.

Yes, it is Disneyesque, but I can easily suspend my disbelief to allow the atmosphere to positively impact my dinner.  \n\nIt was a quiet night and I had my choice of tables.  My server was attentive and did not mind answering my first timer questions.  I wanted pasta, and ordered Penne Aglio Olio with Saut\u00e9ed Spinach.  It came with a side salad, but not just a small plate of iceberg and a few veggies.  A large bowl of fresh Romaine, Plum Tomatoes, Shaved Carrots, Red Onion, and Balsamic was placed in front of me.  It was almost enough to be a meal by itself.  It was very good, and I placed it to the side when the main course arrived, so I could enjoy them together.  \n\nThe Penne was another large deep plate well mixed with Extra Virgin and Chopped Garlic.  The Spinach was fresh and saut\u00e9ed whole leaf and piled nicely mid-plate.  Really well done.  All this for under $10. \n\nI can see how Original Dominick's has expanded and thrived.  Good food and good value. \n\nA powerful combo. No need to become the New Dom's.",

Will it be a dive with your shoes sticking to the floor, and the food indigestible?  Or, will the place have a pleasant personality and tone with decent grub given its inherent limitations?  \n\nVery happy to report that China Wok is the later.  \n\nThe small space is clean and bright, with the owners/operators equally so.  The menu is adequate for both lunch and dinner, but as I was here in the afternoon for a late lunch, I went with the lunch specials.  Orange Chicken, Fried Rice and a drink (water) for a very reasonable price. \n\nYes, it was served in its take out container, but in an interesting way.  It came on a tray with the take out menu opened fully to act like a placemat.  Pleasant alternative to just having the various folding boxes placed in front of me.  Too, the smile that accompanied the service was an unexpected bonus.  Could have used a spoon along with the skinny plastic fork, but why quibble? \n\nThe meal was on the high end for cheap Chinese walk away.  The Chicken was not heavily coated, and it appeared it had not been frozen for long, if at all.  It was soft and pliant without that freezer burn toughness so often present.  The sauce was properly piquant with slices of Orange Peel and Red Szechuan Chili throughout.  The Fried Rice was decent with small chunks of pork and veggies. \n\nAll in all, a surprisingly good meal.  While it would never be confused with fine dining, it was certainly substantial enough without the obvious pitfalls of fast Chinese, that it is worth another visit.",

Turns out that Perfetto's is bigger than it looks, with a dining room in back, counter service in front, and a comprehensive menu.  \n\nI sat down in the dining area (where it was warmer), alongside some of Trenton's finest.  I didn't want pizza, so ordered the lunch sized Penne with Broccoli, Garlic and Oil.  I asked for the garlic to be very well done.  The lunch came with choice of soup or salad, and a basket of home baked bread.  \n\nThe platter arrived overflowing with Broccoli and Penne.  The Garlic was thin sliced, golden and ubiquitous. A little grated Romano and ground Pepper, and I was in business.  It tasted great!  The Salad with Balsamic was adequate, but not memorable, and the bread, while warm, was basically pizza dough shaped into a half loaf. It would have been better flat and covered with red gravy and cheese.  \n\nThe service was friendly, bilingual, and perhaps a bit slow due to the dining room being out of sight of the front cashier and kitchen door.  Still, at $7.50 for a full meal with take home extras, I was pleased with finding Perfetto's.\n\nPerfetto's was not perfect, but had its moments of grandeur.\n\nMARCH 3, 2015 UPDATE: Returned today and had Cavatelli Spinach and a Bowl of Chicken Veggie Soup.  The Soup was loaded with soft Chicken, Onions, Celery and Carrots, and the Cavatelli was a full platter of well saut\u00e9ed spinach with plenty of golden garlic.  Impressive lunch for $7.95!\n\nUPDATE: MARCH 6, 3018 - Perfetto's is really making a statement now. The house was near capacity today @1:30. Far busier than last time I was here about two years ago. Still a better than average kitchen with a real bargain for lunch - almost a dinner size meal, now at $8.50. My penne aglio olio with broccoli was a heavy load, without skimp. Salad still needs an upgrade from iceberg, but otherwise, this joint is one of the best deals in town.",

It is one of several around this part of Bucks County, developed to bring commercial opportunity and convenience to the new \"suburbs\" being created by Mr. Levitt.  As such it is living history.  \n\nMadison sits in the middle of all this 70 year old Americana.  Its interior is in the luncheonette style food dispensary, which adds to its authenticity and comfort.  It feels like you could easily sit down with your parents and grandparents at one of the booths for a $.75 meal. \n\nAlone, I chose the old fashioned counter where I could alternate between eating, reading and chatting with the staff.  Here, that is a special pleasure because all the women were warm and attractive. Christine served me with a smile and friendly banter as sweet as the syrup on my French Toast.  Lori was equally engaging, and betrothed to Dean, the owner. I met him when he sat down at the counter to chat with another customer. Cool dude.\n\nMy breakfast was solid.  The coffee flowed freely, and the FT was made of \"Texas Toast,\" well egged and grilled.  Even the Turkey Sausage was more than expected (4 links) and good tasting.  I asked for a drop of Vanilla in the egg mix, but there was none in the kitchen. Regardless, it still was very good.\n\nRumor has it that New Madison may have a sibling in Langhorne soon.  Stay tuned for an important announcement.  \n\nI am saving the 5th Star for credit card convenience.",

    "text": "I've been to Tina's twice (not counting the visit to the bagel side of the building).  The first visit was to try their pizza.  I had a slice of Old Style Brooklyn Pie and one of Regular Pizza.  \n\nWhile the Brooklyn effort was excellent, with robust sauce, fresh basil and a lively crunchy crust, the Regular slice was just average.  Part of the problem was the while the oven time was sufficient for the thinner crust Brooklyn to be completely reheated, the standard pie had a thicker crust and it did not heat up to the proper temp, leaving the bite soft and thick, rather than firm and cracker firm.  That is just a matter of the kitchen knowing what the oven can do and how long it takes to do it. \n\nMy second visit last week went with the Italian Hot Dog on the recommendation of the server, (another Tina, I believe).  These creations were born in Trenton about a generation ago (the dearly departed Casino on Anderson St., and its sibling, Tony Goes).  This bambino was amazingly great!  It was loaded with Green Frying Peppers, and large, chunky Hash Brown Potatoes that were grilled to a nice brown firm edge.  Each bite sliced through the fresh Italian Torpedo, Crunchy Potato, Pepper, Red Pepper and finally the Frankfurter. Heinz Ketchup and French's Mustard were on the table.  It was so big, it could have been two meals. The lunch also came with a cup of soup (Chicken Noodle was homemade and tasty.) \n\nWith very good bagels, too, Tina's is a good destination for breakfast or lunch. They bring an extra ingredient to their menu - imagination.",

The staff is warm and usually prompt in that offhand attentive way we all know.  The menu is simple and everything I have tried has been solidly satisfying.  \n\nMy choices tend to be the same each year, as I obviously can't get there often.  An order of Spring Rolls (Shrimp, Pork, Greens, Noodles in translucent Rice Paper), Mixed Wok Veggies with Tofu in Ginger Sauce, and one of several great Pho alternatives. My young son, as always the genuine food critic, came to love their Chicken Wings, Orange Chicken, and eventually, the Pho Ga. All these dishes have been enjoyable and strong enough to induce some loyalty.  \n\nYes.

If it is approaching mid summer, it almost reminds of its namesake in Cuba.  \n\nWhen we stopped in for lunch yesterday after concluding our business in nearby Lahaska, we all marveled at the perfection of the moment.  Havana contributed to the occasion by providing drink and victuals to our liking, with friendly efficient service.  I split a Panini Cubano and Side Salad, both of which were very good.  The grilled sandy contained BBQ Pork, and Mild Cheese between the fresh large format bread.  The Side Salad was full of lively greens, reds, purples and yellows in a variety of shapes and a pleasantly spiced dressing.  The accompanying Fries were the thicker crunchy type, and not really necessary given the rest of the meal.  \n\nThe other companions were also content, and we lingered a while, slowly finishing our drinks and conversations while we enjoyed the breeze created by the nearby Delaware River and the surrounding hills.  \n\nWhile I cannot speak to the nightside of Havana nor New Hope here, it is a wonderful spot for a leisurely lunch on a warm Friday afternoon in late May.",

The Vietnamese restaurant, Pho & Beyond is right next door, and a convenient neighbor to have if dessert apres noodle soup is your sweet desire.  \n\nThe space includes two storefronts, and is bright and cheery.  The staff dresses the part of bakers and assistants, with white coats and hats.  With all the goodies in displays, and glass walls permitting a look at the actual creation of the cookies, cakes, scones, petit fours, and cupcakes, Weinrich's is all about seduction and temptation.  In that it succeeds quite well.  It was next to impossible not to want to sample a little of everything in sight, especially when they offered me a petit four as a first timer.  That was small and delicious, and set everything that happened next into motion.  \n\nJust had a get a half dozen cupcakes (Raspberry Cream, Caramel Cream, and Lemon Cream), and the same number of the freshly baked and glazed donuts.  A small bag of scones were thrown in for good measure.  \n\nEverything was very good to excellent.  The cake bottoms were firm enough to hold the top load easily.  Each cupcake was injected with the cream of choice, right down to the bottom of the base. The icing was soft with subtle flavor, rather than the hard topping found in many shops.  The donuts were more the standard variety, with Red Velvet and Vanilla cake style, as well as traditional glazed and French Cruller alternatives.  All dipped in vanilla glaze icing, they were less enchanting as their texture, touch and taste were not so unique from the more mass produced options found elsewhere.  The scones were raisined, and had a mild sweetness.  \n\nThere was far more in this shop than could be sampled or purchased in one visit.  I am not a bakery cookie guy, preferring home baked to almost anything that can be made in quantity, yet given what I've just tried, Weinrich's is certainly worth several returns to get hands and tongue into the rest of this cookie jar.",

The market is only open Thursday thru Saturday, so plan accordingly.\n\nThe BBQ is excellent across the board.  From pork, chicken, and beef, through many vegetables, the most notable of which are the carrots, yams, and red potatoes.  As noted in the other reviews, the approach to BBQ is different than the better known rub cuisines of Texas, Memphis, North Carolina, etc.  Here the meat is smoked first until it is tender and falling off the bone.  Then it is mixed with a variety of delicious, tangy sauces and allowed to steep until the meat and sauce merge and something completely new is created.  \n\nI have purchased the whole chickens in the past, and they were very good. Perfect for a family dinner with a few of the original side dishes.  These days, I am more lunch oriented, and go for the pulled meat sandwiches and veggies.  The Pulled Pork is excellent, and the Pulled BBQ Ribs are so succulent I hate to swallow and lose the flavor orgy in my mouth.  Beware small bones. \n\nThe lunch special is one of the BBQ meats on a fresh roll and a side dish of your choice.  The prices run from $6 to $8 for the meal. You need to ask for napkins and a fork, as they are not routinely thrown into the bag.  \n\nAll in all a great alternative for lunch, not to mention the overall curiosity of walking around the market and being tempted by everything else being offered by the vendors. \n\nThe only complaint is the general lack of cleanliness in the market. I guess that is why Zook's is called a \"Barn.\"",

But, it is worth finding.  \n\nThe family run enterprise is a staple of Tucson, dishing out very good South of the Border plates at reasonable prices.  It is one of those few shops I always return to when in town for the gem show extravaganza in late January/early February.  There is usually a short wait for a table, as the space is small and a tight squeeze.  \n\nThe food is decent, if not haute cuisine, and quite tasty and filling. A couple of margaritas or cervesas after a long day looking at hot rocks is the best way to begin the chill down.  The service can be erratic, but they make up for it with attitude and good humor.  \n\nOne of the best things they have is a wall full of calendars for purchase with classic Mexican art the prime selling attraction.  I love hanging one on my office wall as a recollection of my time in Tucson, and Rosa's colorful hospitality.",

I remembered being here maybe 15 years ago, when the place had slipped into a less than optimal condition, but the new version is just fine.  \n\nI loved my 5th floor corner room.  It was New York small, but clean and very comfortable.  My windows overlooked both 17th Street and the Philadelphia Baptist Church, whose spires filled up one window with an old-Europe sensibility.  I actually moved the HDTV out of the way so I could see it more clearly and take photos.  The bed was firm and I had way too many pillow choices.  Plenty of hot water and pressure in the morning rush times.  \n\nThe only issue I had was with the parking.  While the valet is convenient, at $39 per night, it is expensive.  It would be better if upon reserving a room, the hotel provided detailed information on parking options (location, cost, in/out), and allowed the customer the ability to prepare in advance for using self parking down the street.  It might only save a fin or two, but having preferences honored is what good guest services is all about.  \n\nI would certainly stay at The Latham again.  This is a great spot in Center City, just off Rittenhouse Square, with plenty of streetlife for everyone's taste and habits.",

Their menu is for breakfast, lunch and dinner, and offers cuisine from the Agean, as well as curtsies to the American palate with pizza and burgers.  They have not yet installed any spits for the roasting of the lamb-beef mix that goes in the traditional gyro, but grilling it on the griddle seems to do the trick quite nicely in the meantime.  \n\nThe place is a former pizza parlor, and the basic elements remain unchanged.  Booths and tables along the walls and down the middle of the floor, counter and table service, and refrigeration units with drinks.  The women working there seem to be part of the family that owns the business.  They are friendly, and happy to see new customers.  They were willing to allow me to taste the Avolemono Soup to see if I liked it, without requiring the purchase of the large bowl.  That gesture won me over.  It was quite good, by the way, although thinner than the thick creamy version found at Mikonos in Ewing.  \n\nMy Traditional Gyro Sandwich was a stuffed hot pita, full of nicely browned strips of lamb/beef mix, and a heavy Tzatziki Sauce, whose cool dillness played well with the hot spicy meat.  Shreds of lettuce were also wrapped inside.  The whole thing was delivered, held together tightly with thin paper, and a pile of French Fries finished the plate.  My request for a glass of cold water with lemon was replied to with a large pitcher full of ice and lime wedges.  Nice touch! \n\nGreek Corner is only minutes from the office.  Very happy to have this lunch option so close at hand.",

I certainly wish the Newtown Theater, the oldest in the country, had the same policy.  The digital projection is a big plus. \n\nI was there last Sunday for a 4:00 pm show, and it was packed. Not an empty seat in the house! Applause to the members and others who take interest in this institution, as it makes it a  fine community resource. \n\nIf there is any downside (and I hesitate to mention it), it is that when crowded, the seats are a bit cramped, and not as comfortable as the \"big house\" theaters. Too, sometimes you get some attitude from the regulars who have their favorite seats, and refuse to move over to make room for another couple, forcing them to sit apart. Not much the theater can do about that. \n\nOver all, a wonderful piece of Bucks cultural heritage alive and well today.",

Last week I decided to slow down and smell the chili.  Found Ping Pong on my trusty Yelp mobile guide, and stopped in with son of mine for dinner. \n\nFirst impressions were positive.  Clean, bright, colorful, smiling faces, pleasant aromas. We took a table along the wall and as I looked around I realized we were in a Chinese spice shop where the dishes would be measured in fire alarms.  My favorite cuisine, but not necessarily in my 13 year old's wheelhouse.  He loves Dumplings, so we went with an order of 6 fried.  I suggested we get Dan Dan Noodles so he could begin to appreciate the more gentle side of the firescale.  He was game for the Hunan Spicy Beef; a good, adventurous call.  I picked the Deep Fried Chicken with Dry Pepper, basically a spicy fried chicken dish he could assimilate.  \n\nAll were very good to near excellent.  The Dumplings were perhaps the least interesting with a heavy dough shell, but well ground pork, and nice dipping sauce.  He actually left one behind.  The Dan Dan's were a big bowl full of thin noodles and a hearty pork sauce that completely covered the noodles beneath.  I had to add extra Sesame Oil to reach the desired heat, but my son was happy with them as delivered.  All gone!  The Spicy Hunan Beef was the best of the bunch - tender sliced beef in a mid-range Hunan brown sauce, Broccoli, Green and Red Chilis and a few other veggies.  Very good.  The Chicken was slightly hotter and quite tasty, but not the \"chicken inferno\" I had anticipated from other Szechuanese joints.  Still, just right for the initiat.  \n\nService was timely and cordial.  The majority of the customers were Chinese, but no one seemed to mind two round eyes in their midst.  Besides, we both knew how to handle the chopsticks with aplomb.  \n\nAll in all, an enjoyable repast, and one that I would certainly entertain returning to on one of my increasingly frequent trips west.  \n\nA very nice find, indeed!",

These are discount airlines, so if you fly light the fares will make you smile. \n\nSecond, although parking is no longer free, it is only $8 for 24 hours, in a secure lot right in front of the terminal. Park and walk right through TSA check, across the tarmac, up the stairs onto your plane. Try any of that at an international airport to the north or south. \n\nThird, Enterprise, National, Avis and Budget have rental facilities here, and the rates are without all the extra airport fees and taxes. I have rented here twice when I needed a larger people mover for a day. Admittedly, I booked through Priceline and didn't have to deal with the rent a car games. \n\nFourth, the amenities are minimal, but it is a public place owned by the people of Mercer County. Think of it as a park with landing privileges. They didn't want their taxes used for first class lounges. It is seldom crowded, and the bar/restaurant Sky Lounge offers the basics for three meals and decent drink choice. You can snack and chill watching flights take off and land through the large window overlooking the runway. When was the last time you did that? \n\nFifth, flying lessons are available from private instructors with offices around the airport. \n\nSixth, living ten minutes from the terminal makes TTN part of the community, and too convenient to pass up.\n\nSeventh, TTN has been in business since 1929, and the enterprises around the airport played an important role in WW II, and it is the home of many Fortune 500 private jets. Amelia Earhart even flew through here. \n\nSo, next time you consider flying from Trenton, maybe give yourself some extra time to explore the area. Several good bars and restos with a few minutes drive to help you on your journey.",

Maybe it was the new competition in Newtown that led me to other outlets for my pizza and cheesesteak fix. Maybe it was the sameness of the offerings.  Regardless, it was time for a return visit. \n\nSo, I went back for lunch a few days ago.  The space is about the same, with the wood oven on the left, and the dining room on the right.  The table layout remained the same with mostly deuces and quads around the room.  At 1, the place was buzzing.  A few business lunches, and some post-yoga cool downs.  The menu was all about pizza, cheesesteaks and salads at lunch, although the few dinner entres looked appealing.  The prices were surprisingly reasonable.  It was possible to get out for under $10 @ lunch, perhaps because the shop was in an older strip center and the rent is decent. \n\nTo ease my way back into their kitchen, I ordered a Chicken Cheesesteak with Fried Onions.  It arrived a few minutes later loaded with the prime ingredients.  The roll was soft, but fresh and pliant.  The amount of chicken in the sandy was enormous, and with the cheese and onions was a lot to eat.  The biggest pleasant surprise was how juicy it was.  It had been taken from the grill in time to avoid dryness, and the onions complemented the meat and cheese well.  I mentioned this to my lovely server, and she just smiled and said she had cooked it for me.  No reason to doubt her. \n\nI won't let another half decade go by without returning for more dishes.  Pizza comes next. \n\nHowever that turns out, I am definitely a fan of the Chicken Cheesesteak.",

    "text": "Nam Phuong was the last Empress of Vietnam.  \n\nPerhaps, it is fitting to name the queen of the Vietnamese houses after her.  She was born too late to enjoy her royalty for very long, and she was denied the privilege of living her life in her native land; dying in relative obscurity in France.  \n\nHer namesake is similar to her in some ways.  The restaurant is large and well run.  Chandeliers suggest a palatial guise, and the servers in black are disciplined, polite and respectful, as you would expect from a royal house. The menu is diverse to appeal to a variety of guests, and the kitchen is skilled in turning out top quality dishes that satisfy those invited to the Emperor's Table. \n\nEven a solitary traveler such as I was treated with dignified homage. Though a busy night full of families and intriguing couples, I was given a nice table, plenty of time to decide my meal, and graceful delivery, checking on satisfaction, pickup and an offer to desire more before leaving.  I never felt rush by the staff, although the people waiting by the door might have been less patient. \n\nMy Pho with Round Steak and Tripe was excellent, with all fresh trimmings.  The broth was richly complex and a filling bowl at a very reasonable price.  The Summer Rolls were stuffed with fresh Shrimp and Ground Pork, and came with a very good Peanut Dipping Sauce.  As I ate I watched those around me enjoying all the things I wanted to try on my next visit.  \n\nI am not sure that the maxim that a Vietnamese restaurant filled with Vietnamese is a true indication of great food all the time, but it certainly was tonight.  \n\nNam Phuong, where ever her spirit is now, would be pleased that her name is being so well cared for here in Philadelphia.",

    "text": "I started visiting Charcoal when it was also, \"Steaks and Things,\" about 30 years ago. In those days I lived on the Delaware River in Trenton, and came over to Yardley for an out of the way weekend breakfast/brunch.  It was a great place for a romantic wake up after a long night before.  \n\nTwo massive floods and major grief later, a small riverside caf\u00e9 has transformed into a full second story restaurant with an eastern wall of glass overlooking the river that when at peace is serenely beautiful, but when raised to anger is as dangerous as an angry rhino.  Sitting here today over a large white cup of java after an absence of more than a decade, I marveled at how light and airy this loft felt.  If you've spent time at the shore in a reverse living stilted home, you know the tree house sensation.\n\nI was here for breakfast, and ordered the Brioche French Toast.  The room was not full, and I shared the space with various knots of people engaged in friendly conversation.  Being alone, I spoke with my server, Mary Anne, who was a natural salesperson for the establishment.  She updated me on ownership and changing cuisine, and even handed me a dinner menu to take with, hoping I would return to try some of the Small, Large, and Pasta Plates.  \n\nAlthough the environment and dinner menu are 5 Star worthy, the French Toast while good, exhibited a mistake often made by shops attempting the \"Thick\" approach to this dish.  The Brioche was generously sliced, but not left in the egg mix long enough to allow it to penetrate to the center, leaving the middle a bit dry.  Too, the grill was not hot enough to caramelize the surface nooks and crannies to give it the light crunchiness and moist center that separates the good French Toast from the great.  \n\nLooking around I noted some beautiful omelets and fresh fruit cups that hold promise. I will come back to check them out sometime soon.",

    "text": "Lucy's Caf\u00e9 sits on the first floor of 240 W. State Street, Trenton, NJ, across the street from the State Museum/Library Complex and the Department of Education.  It is nothing fancy, but does have room for a lot of people for sit down breakfasts and lunches.  Furniture is vinyl and steel.  \n\nThis morning I stopped in for breakfast for the first time.  There were only a few people there, and I was able to order directly from the cook.  I grabbed a small coffee and a table seat while waiting for the Sausage, Egg & Cheese Sandwich to be done.  When it was, the Korean owner of the shop called for me to pick it up and pay the $5 for everything.  Good price.\n\nThe sandwich was well made with a single patty, fried egg and American cheese on a fresh Kaiser roll.  A small side of home fries was included, and were nicely grilled with crisp edges.  A shake of black pepper and a squirt of ketchup and I retreated to my table to consume the beast.  The plate was Styrofoam and the fork, plastic.  Nothing fancy, but it was certainly substantial.  \n\nThe taste was very good owing to decent ingredients, and a knowing hand at the grill.  Coffee was that Law brand; not the best, but strong enough to chase the morning fatigue away.  \n\nThis stretch of West State Street is quiet in the summer when the legislature is out of session.  There is plenty of street parking available, making for easy in and out.  The parking meters eat quarters in 15 minute increments, so be prepared with enough to cover the time you plan to be inside.",

    "text": "Beautifully converted Lamberville, NJ mansion that offers three squares a day in a quiet, dignified house with plenty of space between the tables for intimate conversation surrounding very good victuals. All very late 19th Century. \n\nI was there for midweek breakfast and walked in to a mostly empty restaurant.  There is an attractive marble counter with stools, but it was loaded with desserts and didn't seem the place designed to really eat. So, I walked to the next dining room, where there was one other table occupied, but so far across the room that I felt totally alone taking a smaller deuce along the opposite wall facing a window.  \n\nEach table in this room was rough cut from a larger tree trunk and finished with smooth top, but the edges left rough. Beautiful. I'd love one for home. \n\nThe menu is fairly small for the morning meal, and pricing is oriented toward higher end cafes, rather than more reasonable primarily breakfast joints. Still, my turkey sausage, fried egg and cheddar on an unusually attractive and tasty roll, reflected the gourmand focus.  Execution was superlative.  My server incorporated my choice for \"lightly runny\" eggs with aplomb. That is exactly what I got. Coffee from Counter Culture. Not sure why they don't use java from local roasters better than this North Carolina outfit given the trend toward local sourcing. Still, it was solid Joe, refilled gracefully as needed. \n\nNothing run of the mill about Caf\u00e9 Galleria. If you're into morning romantic interludes, this is the place.",

    "text": "Hurricane Jack's Bar & Restaurant on New Falls Road, Levittown, PA, is one of many divey sports bars in this end of Bucks County. On a Saturday afternoon it was busy, but not a full house, with primarily men watching the Phillies as they chugged their beer and smoked their cigs between running conversations about the game. Friendly, welcoming crowd (I was wearing my Eagles Super Bowl cap), they allowed me to jump into their party. \n\nI ordered a Sam Adams Seasonal and their Hurricane Special Burger (onions, hot pepps, provolone), medium. The ale was wet and refreshing; the sandwich large and tasty, despite the slippage into well done territory. Couldn't open my jaws wide enough to bite down on it, so I approached with knife and fork. Still juicy even with freezer time, and we'll worth the $6.95. Hurricane also does homemade potato chips as a side with the burgers. They were really good and well peppered, making the optional fries unnecessary. The surprise star in a supporting role.\n\nI hung out for a while after I was done eating to watch the end of the game, and enjoy the regulars. Even with the multitude of similar inviting taverns around Levittown, Hurricane Jack's is a great low budget watering hole to chill. \n\nLots of choices are a good thing.",

    "text": "If a cozy country breakfast/brunch is your thing, then The Fancy Fig on Second Street Pike in Wrightstown, PA., is singing your song. Hidden in The Gathering, a small group of shops and offices in the heart of \"downtown\" Wrightstown, and cattycorner from Ralphie's Tavern at the intersection with Penn's Park Road, it may take a few minutes to find The Fig, but if you walk into what appears to be the inner courtyard, you will find it waiting there for you. \n\nStepping inside the first impression is of a bakery or small deli with kitchen behind the wall, and dining area off to the right. I was greeted by my server, who invited me to sit anywhere.  There was a group of guys (and two priests) sitting at the largest table, so I moved past them and took a small table against the rear window.  Auspicious to have my morning meal blessed by the local clergy. I was brought a small laminated menu and the first cup of their locally roasted coffee.  \n\nThe java was joltingly strong and good, and I savored it as the chef put together my favorite breakfast sandwich. It arrived on a ciabatta roll, with egg and sausage links hanging over the edge. Didn't mind at all. They also offered a tiny square dish of fresh fruit, including one gigantic blackberry surrounded by watermelon and cantaloupe. It was all quite good. Fresh, locally sourced, and hot off the iron. Very good sammy!\n\nThe manager came over to inquire of my satisfaction. I gave her the right answer, and began a short conversation about the business and sources of their ingredients.  Most interestingly, the coffee beans were roasted in nearby New Jersey by a family member in the Joe business. \"Crescent Moon\" I think she said.  She suggested that the decaf was even better than the premium blend, so I requested a refill of that genre. She was right.  It had a more interesting flavor profile, but without the kick.  \n\nThe view from the window of the interior court area was peaceful on this Indian Summer morn. It made for a perfect setting to start the day.  Open for a year, The Fancy Fig is a cool spot to enjoy your morning over quality coffee and a solid homemade breakfast.",

    "text": "I was thinking \"Mykonos\" as we drove to Mikonos Restaurant on Scotch Road in Ewing, NJ.  The Aegean island is a place I hung out for a while in an earlier life, drinking Gerovasilliou and Agiorgitiko to excess in the harbor side tabernas by day and surrendering to the liltingly haunting Bouzoukis by night.  I couldn't share my reveries, but I wondered how close to my recollections this Greek house by the same name would come to those wild Hellonic daze. \n\n It wasn't fair to even entertain the possibility that there would be any similarity; after all, that was life in a mystic age long gone from this coil.  Still, it did serve to awaken something long dormant, and while this is the age of dark cynicism, the place had enough pictures on the walls and aromas wafting through the room to allow for a moment of silent appreciation. Wine saturated memories are sometimes enough.\n\nThe food was pretty good, too.  \n\nOur opening salvo of Avgo Lemono Soup was Star Dog Champion delicious. Creamy, Lemon bite, soft Chicken chunks, and Rice.  Our three spoons fought for each drop.  \n\nThe follow up for two of us was the tour de force Liga Apo Ola for 2, a huge platter with ample Moussaka, Spanakopeta, Pastitsio, Dolmades, and maybe something else I have forgotten, served with a metal spatula to aid in distribution.  They were all exceptional, although the Stuffed Grape Leaves had more  dry rice filling than I recall from past experiences.  My guests had never eaten Greek cuisine before, and they were so impressed that they tried to duplicate the Lemon Soup at home the next day.  \n\nOur third member ordered a Chicken Souvlaki Platter.  It looked great (see photo), but my taste of the chicken surprised me with the strange toughness of the meat.  He gamely ate everything, but I could tell he was struggling with it.  A large slab of Moussaka from our plate was the least we could do to help him out. \n\nBut for that last bit of news, this was a 5 Star dinner.  We will return in due course for the Avgo Lemono and further exploration of the menu.  Those Gyros that went by looked amazing!",

    "text": "I finally made it to Felix's Caketeria on Christmas Eve and purchased a dozen of their unique creations to bring to the family celebration.  \n\nWalking in I was first impressed with the warm aromatic shop.  The display case is stocked with an amazing assortment of cupcakes and their bigger siblings that can be baked for weddings and other occasions. Everything was colorful and shining.  The staff was warm and professional and clearly proud of their work, as they should be.  I had no real idea which varieties to select, so I asked the charming woman behind the counter to do it for me, and she obliged.  She even offered to hand write a cheat sheet so I wouldn't forget what I had.   She alerted me that the shop was not \"nut free.\"  Good catch as one of the young nephews has a serious peanut allergy.  The cupcakes were $3/ and $33/doz.  At first I was a bit taken aback by the price, but as I examined the products I realized that I would never do that much detail work for so little compensation.  So, I walked out with two plastic containers especially formed to hold 6 of those sweet babies each.  \n\nNow, I admit to not being a Cupcake kind of guy - if sweets are my undoing, they will be donuts and homemade cookies and pies.  So, while I marveled at the creative names and imagined the richness of the buttercream icing, I did not really know what to expect.  When I arrived in western Pennsylvania 5 hours later with my contribution to the dessert table I was surprised to watch the women in the family stop what they were doing and \"kvell\" over them.  They actually began to negotiate with each other over which delight they wanted, or were willing to share.  The other fresh-out-of-the-oven pumpkin and pecan pies, plates full of cookies, etc., were momentarily forgotten in their lust for these petite morsels of lathered dough in paper dresses.  Some were even taken aside and hidden in the cupboard; staking an absolute claim.  \n\nAfter sating ourselves over a great meal in the Allegheny Mountains, we finally reached dessert time.  The Oreo, Gingerbread Cheesecake, Chocolate Dirt, Tiramisu, and Lemon Drop sacrificed themselves first.  But, they were not devoured, but savored with each mini spoonful.  Eyes rolled and gasps of rapture escaped lips.  I selected a Carrot Cake plump tarte.  It was exactly like a great full size carrot cake with the creamiest, yet not overly sweet, icing imaginable.  Yes. I rubbed my fingers over the plate where it sat after ravishing its body to enjoy every molecule.  Mixed with fresh brew kaffe it was the perfect ending to a wonderful afternoon and meal in Westmoreland County.  For a few minutes the talk shifted from hunting to the more refined world of tiny cakes in tight skirts.  \n\nI did hear a few less than sterling comments on one or two of them, but nothing to seriously detract from an otherwise otherworldly experience. \n\nMerry Christmas to all, especially those I have come to know and appreciate on Yelp.  Have a cupcake and reflect on all that is right in your lives.",

I thought I was in the wrong place on a narrow winding road until I saw the actual building in front of me. It feels a little like Middle Earth, yet the joint is cozy and dim with a nice size bar and several TVs showing sports (The Preakness was on while we were there). \n\nWe were there for the \"Make Your Own Burgers,\" and after settling in on a 4 stool hightop, we found the forms to be completed and the little golf pencils, and went to work. The process was to check off choice of meat, cheese, condiments and accompaniments (some free, some not), and the roll desired. Base price is $9.99, but with upgrades the price can jump a few bucks. Fresh cut fries are also available for an extra $2. I went with what I though was a patty melt (onions, spicy mayo and swiss cheese on Jewish rye), while son opted for saut\u00e9ed shrooms and red peppers on brioche.  \n\nAlthough we both asked for a medium finish, the pucks were more medium well, without pink centers. Regardless, they were both juicy and delicious, with no sign of freezer life. Really very good. The only downside, and this could be on me for thinking the kitchen knew what the Jewish rye was for, was that what I got rather than a Patty Melt was a burger on plain, ungrilled bread. It just didn't work without a crisp bite to the rye from time on the hot steel.  I kicked the slices to the curb and ate everything else. Next time, I will specify the bread should be grilled. The fries came in a small deep fry stainless basket and were also quite good. \n\nDespite those issues, OCI is a cool place to hang out. Prices are good, and once the kinks are worked out, the kitchen should turn out quality dishes. They are on the right track.",

Right off the campus of The College of New Jersey in the new Campus Town commercial center, this place has room for hundreds in a boisterous barroom with rectangular bar, and slightly less obstreperous dining area.\n\n I was there for a light bite supper while being entertained by the Saturday late afternoon/evening NFL playoff game.  In this place, the college basketball contest between Kansas and Iowa State was getting a lot more attention. I guess that's to be expected in a campus hangout with its own team. \n\nI caught the end of the weekend happy hour, and grabbed a pint of Sam Adams Boston Lager for $3. I also ordered a bowl of Baked Onion Soup and their Brussel Sprouts app.  The soupe aux oignons was a small bowl with all the right ingredients, and melted gruyere all around the lip. It was pretty good, and most importantly, hot, on that cool rainy eve.  The choux de Bruxelles were halved, broiled and doused in a tart vinaigrette and bacon bits. There were a lot of them. Very tasty and an excellent choice, if I don't say so myself. \n\nWhile my college days are mostly behind me (my son will be a freshman in September), I can still enjoy the high energy exuberance and animal spirits loose in the chamber. With an extended happy hour and better than average sports bar kitchen, this joint has a chance to succeed and see me again.",

It sits on the main street in town, all shiny and bright over all these years. The granite counter is split by the kitchen entrance, with a half dozen spinners on each side, and creatively anchored at each elbow by an old barber's chair.  The outer wall is all booths and large windows. The joint oozes Americana charm. \n\nThe menu consists of one sheet, with breakfast on one side, and lunch on the other. Best to plan early meals, as the hours are only from 6:00 AM to 2:00 PM. I sat at the far left counter where I could see the entire dining area.

I sipped my java while awaiting the arrival of my french toast. \n\nThe three bisected thick slices of brioche were served on an oval plate that barely contained its load.  Side dish full of butter cups and Kraft syrup was close at hand for proper doctoring.  I could see that the bread had bathed in the egg/vanilla mix long enough to soak through to the core. The surface was nicely caramelized with enough crispy edges to provide the texture I like.  Allowing time for the butter to melt and run, and the syrup to absorb, I was quickly ready to dive in.  \n\nIt was very good.  \n\nNo dry spots.  No eggy extrusions. No scorch marks. Nothing fancy at this traditional meal hall. Just perfectly finished egg toast fry that was a pleasure to consume. Old fashioned, just like the house it was made in.",

The menu is extensive and they do have a sushi guy slicing and wrapping seaweed. \n\nMy first impression was positive for a simple Egg Foo Young plate with Egg Roll, Wonton Soup and white rice. The base stock for the soup was chicken broth that was not too salty and had decent wonton/dumplings that were not thick skinned, nor with questionable meat filling. The egg roll was even better with adequate roast pork mixed with cabbage and a few greens. The EFY was two pancakes filled with more pork and veggies and a better than average brown sauce that seems to have been prepared just in time. \n\nOverall, I liked this meal on their Combination menu for dinner. I particularly appreciated the absence of obligatory broccoli florets, which is way overdone by most Chinese restaurants. \n\nThe house being clean with friendly service was also a pleasant positive touch. \n\nYes. I grade these places on a curve.",

    "text": "Ateethi has nothing to do with mastication, although it may seem that way from its name. Rather, it is a hybrid North and South Indian kitchen in an old commercial strip at the corner of Grant Avenue and Krewstown Road in Northeast Philadelphia, very close by Bustleton. \n\nIt opens at 5:00 pm for dinner most days, so we found ourselves waiting for the flag to go up when we arrived a few minutes early in advance of scheduled foot massage nearby @6. Looking around we saw about twenty basic tables and metal framed chairs in a dimly lit room, with a large mural of the Taj Mahal on the back wall.  The orange tones and low wattage bulbs made for a rather dim perspective. But, our eyes adjusted and the menu became legible and was fairly extensive in its offerings.  Because there were Indo-Chinese dishes, we headed in that direction as it crossed many of our tastebud preferences, and it is not as readily available in most Indian shops. \n\nStarting with Gobi Manchurian as an app, we received a long rectangular platter of cauliflower florets, onion and peppers in a heavy dark ruby chili sauce.  The veggies had a thin breading and had been fried enough to permit the outer shell to be somewhat crispy, while the heavy sauce held many spicy secrets that made our palettes shout for joy.  As entrees we had Chilli Chicken and their Baingan Bharta (mashed eggplant), and garlic naan to soak up every drop of sauce left on the plates. We discovered that the Manchurian sauce on the cauliflower was basically the same as the Chilli used with the chicken. Both were very good, but no need for both on the same night. Perhaps, they should use the same name to eliminate this confusion. The Bharta was extra hot, and delicious enough to make my nose run. Glad I had that extra napkin!\n\nThis was a very good and tasty Indian meal. Prices were good, too. We would definitely return to discover more about their offerings, especially the vegetarian options.  Services was informative and efficient, if not overly friendly.",

Still, I found myself heading that way one morning this week, I was hungry, and Yelp Mobile alerted me that Bagel Stop was just ahead.  \n\nI didn't know if I would be able to sit down or the place was strictly take away.  That question was answered quickly when I opened the door and found myself in a tiny shop the size of my walk in closet.  Smelled very good.  Friendly faces all around.  Bagel bins in front of me singing their siren song.  \n\nI ordered my trusty Onion, Butter and Swiss, not toasted.  Four minutes later it was made, bagged and ready for payment.  Bagel and large coffee for under $4?! Surely you jest.  \n\nSat in my car and opened the bag after taking a swig of java.  The bagel wasn't the biggest rounder I'd ever seen, but it had lots of Onion Flakes and a nice aroma.  First Bite Experience was amazing. The crust was firm, but giving.  The inner texture light and airy, allowing the onion/butter/Swiss mix to play its nutty sweet flavors on my palate.  \n\nThis was an exemplary bagel.  Almost at the level of Bagel Train in Yardley.  It was so similar that I wondered if Bagel Train and Bagel Stop had a common ancestry.  \n\nA few more visits and I will know if I have discovered the holy grail of Jersey bagels.",

Consider yourself fortunate to find it, because this house under new management has a strong Vietnamese kitchen and is large enough to seat a lot of people.  The servers in green shirts are attentive and for the most part bilingual.  They seem to enjoy their jobs, which is a sign that ownership cares about them and the quality of their interactions with customers.  \n\nWe stopped in after shopping down Washington Avenue, in need of some sustenance after stocking up on our Asian food supplies for the month.  We were in the mood for both Vietnamese and Chinese food, and found that they really did a good job on both.  \n\nWe ordered Wonton Noodle Soup, their Deluxe Fried Rice, and Sweet & Sour Chicken.  A little from column A, and more from column B.  The soup had the excellent flavor of a long simmering beef based pho.  It was rich with mildly spiced undertones, thin sliced steak, and a load of vermicelli noodles and wontons.  The side plate of accessories was put to good use to bring the taste up even more.  It was such a large bowl, that we were given a second smaller one without asking.  It came in handy as I slurped heartily from the secondary pot. Didn't even need any Sriracha. If there was any weakness it was the wontons, that while delicate lacked much filling and thus, taste. This kept it from being nearly perfect.  \n\nThe S/S Chicken was better than expected - crispy thin coating, tender white meat that did not have the texture of being frozen, and a thick tangy orange sauce, pineapple chunks and green peppers.  Liked it.  Finally, the House Deluxe Fried Rice was excellently made; moist and full of small caliber meats and veggies.  So good after too many Chinese take out mass produced fried rice sides.  This was the real deal.  \n\nHuong Tram is another superior entry into the Vietnamese world around Washington Avenue.  Will definitely be back to dive into their soup and com (broken rice) offerings. Their smoothies look great, too!",

Parking is just about as bad in this developing Chinese/Vietnamese neighborhood, but you are more likely to find a spot on the street with a little patience. \n\nWe took a table along the wall and appreciated the prompt service provided by staff.  Ordering pho tai nam (beef noodle soup with rare steak and flank), vermicelli with BBQ pork and summer rolls, we had more than we could finish for just slightly north of $20.  \n\nThe pho had a nice broth base with plenty of thin sliced steak and flank. Plenty of good slurping, but on the way home I began to feel a little off, like there could have been some MSG in the pot to hasten the reduction process. I am mildly allergic to that, and began to feel lightheaded shortly after departing. That is my deal, and many do not have that reaction. Still, the bowl was loaded with noodles. The small bowl was enough, even though the larger vessel was only a buck more.  The pork dish was excellent, however, with the meat a deep dark amber from its time marinating in the BBQ sauce. It was chewy in a good way as it slowly released its smoky sweet flavor with mastication. Again, plenty of dry noodles in the bowl, along with shredded carrot and ground peanuts.  A little fish sauce splashed over the top, and we were in business. The summer rolls were nothing special, but were certainly fresh, with a good peanut dipping sauce. \n\nI would return to Pho Saigon, but inquire about the MSG situation before ordering. \n\nThis neighborhood has potential.",

It is often crowded at happy hour, but when I arrived for lunch with a friend, we had the entire vault room to ourselves, and the bar was not busy.  Sadly, because this was also a business lunch, we did not indulge in their golden liquids, but did enjoy their house made root beer.  \n\nService was very good, with knowledgeable and affable dude, who gave us the time needed to chat as we perused their menu.  I ordered the chicken sandwich, although the pizza offerings were tempting. The meal was served on a wood plank with side salad and balsamic dressing. The sourdough bread was lightly toasted/grilled, and the chicken, cheese, aioli and lettuce held together well, and tasted great.  The side salad was mostly green with romaine, escarole, carrot slivers and vinegar. It was okay.  Overall, it was a solid, tasty lunch.  With the root beer and tip it came to $22 per person, which is rich for my blood for a midweek lunch. \n\nStill, it was worthwhile to get inside Vault and appreciate how attractive it was in a dark wood, cloudy, kind of way. On this rainy afternoon, it exuded a quiet historic tone that was relaxing. It definitely calls for a return call, when there is time to enjoy their brewer's craft, and deconstruct one of their pizzas or other tapas.",

    "text": "Two Slices & Drink Review\n\nHidden Trenton, the underrated website that highlights the best of New Jersey's capital city, says that Jerry's Pizza has the best pie within the borders of this august urban jungle.  While this narrow focus eliminates all of the former greats that have moved out of town over the past decade, it is interesting to see what is considered today's best by another reputable source.  This website has led me to some excellent discoveries in the past. \n\nSitting in the 700 block of South Broad Street, admittedly not the most savory stretch of America even by day, Jerry's lights up the area with plenty of color and pictures of food covering their windows.  Within, the shop is small, with room for only 4 booths, and a narrow shelf and 3 bar stools along the opposite wall.  The pizza ovens sit behind a glass counter, with the kitchen beside it.  Everyone is bilingual here, although the menu is strictly Italian.  \n\nI checked out the pies on display and asked for slices of sausage and plain pizza.  I wanted them \"well done,\" to bring them back to life - cheese bubbling and undercarriage scorched and firm.  That is exactly what I received.  The circumference was a very narrow band of exposed crust, while the rest was tomato sauce, cheese and crumbled pork sausage all around.  Big slices that emitted enough steam to fog my glasses and offer up an intoxicating aroma of garlic, tomato, basil and mozza.  A hearty shake of crushed red peppers and I was ready to chomp.  \n\nThe first slice (sausage) held its point pretty well, despite the extra weight topside.  I was able to first bite without aid of a second hand.  The crust was thin and crisp with a mild yeastiness.  The sauce tended to the salty side (especially given the meat), and the overall BCS (bite/chew/swallow) was quite pleasant.  While I prefer a sweeter sauce, this one did not bother me.  The chef knew from tomato gravy. \n\nThe second slice had cooled a bit and needed a point lift to get into my mouth.  Not a real issue given how thin the crust was.  The overall taste and texture were also fine.  \n\nI have no reason to doubt that Jerry's (my namesake) makes the best pizza in Trenton.  It was solid.  Whether it can compete with the Tomato Pie royalty in the greater Trenton area, is a story (and review) for another day.\n\nJerry's is worth a visit.",

Although the three buildings appear to have low occupancy these days, the cafeteria-like first floor space appears to be doing all right. \n\nOrdering is by digital screens and credit/debit card. Food prep is behind the counter or from a large salad bar set up in the middle of the floor. Seems pretty efficient. I was aware of its existence from Yelp, as well as its previous incarnations. After visiting PennMed across the road, I decided to go over and see what was going on. First impressions were positive, so I ordered a Farmers Omelet (veggies, cheddar) home fries, sourdough toast and La Colombe Java. It came to around none bucks, picked up at the service counter and eaten at one of their free tables. \n\nThis was a 2 egger with adequate sauteed onions, mushrooms, roasted red pepper and melted cheese. One slice of buttered toast accompanied the main dish. The potatoes were undercooked, but not so hard as to challenge my molars. The coffee was the strongest entrant to the breakfast sweepstakes, as La Colombe usually is. \n\nOn a cooler day I would have been tempted to sit under the outdoor pergola to enjoy a more leisurely morning, but given the pre-thunderstorm forecast, I opted to remain inside in the sanitary surroundings. Too, given a choice I prefer less single use plastics than provided here. No deduction, but a word to the wise and ecologically sound.",

In fact, if you miss the old wall mural of the Venice Canals you can still see it there in all its glory.\n\nI stopped in for lunch the other day on my way back to the office.  I parked a short distance away on Anderson Street, and enjoyed the stroll down memory lane to the side door.  Walking in, you might think this was still in the old hands.  Not that much has changed.  Then, I was approached by a lovely, hustling server doing double duty as the hostess, and rather than listening to a warm Italian accent, I heard the romanticism of Espanol.  It was a pleasant momentary adjustment.  \n\nThe menu was full of taco, quesadilla and pupusa options.  Following the recommendations of another Yelper(Mark N.), I went with the Mixtas alternative so I could sample three varieties of the stuffed flat breads.  In addition, the heat of the day being so oppressive, I asked for a Licuado de Papaya con Agua (Papaya Smoothie w/ Water).  For $2, I should have ordered two.  \n\nThe Pupusas were about 7 inches in diameter, and came out steaming on a plate also loaded with Pickled Shredded Cabbage/Carrot Combo,and three Salsas.  Each was nicely stuffed with meat, cheese, peppers, onions, and perhaps somethings I did not recognize.  They were well mashed within, and the textures of light pocket pupusa and the individual insides were subtle, but tasty fun.  They were also filling, and I could barely finish them.  The Salsas were Red, Green, and Mixed, each with their own piquancity.  The Licuado was fundamentally whipped Papaya and water.  It was very good and so refreshing on a 90-plus day.  \n\nThe house had several table occupied when I was there, and everyone seemed to be enjoying themselves.  Although I was the only one there having to think about what to say in Spanish, the servers and other customers were very cool about the obvious Gringo in their midst.  \n\nThe house is clean and bright, and a pleasure to visit.  Chambersburg may not be what it once was, but what it is becoming has promise to be something equally special.",

Great! I do prefer to eat when the dish is right from the oven. \n\nI went with  Chicken Empanada as an appetizer, Chicken and Potato Flautas and large Jugo Tamarindo as a delicious health slurpdown.

There were six fried wheat tortillas rolled up and full of either a chicken/cheese mix or pleasantly mashed potato. This was a first for me, but although I enjoyed the variety provided by the mashed, it wasn't as tasty and compelling as the traditional chicken flute. \n\nThe Tamarind was semisweet and very refreshing. A good offset to the spice of the other dishes. \n\nThere are several very good Dominican kitchens in Trenton, and Gallo Tropical compares well with them.

Quality Italian sausage complemented well with the sweet and savory sauteed veggies. Eggplant breaded lightly and pan fried in extra virgin before placed in the roll with mozza and tomato sauce on top, and baked in the pizza oven until all melted into a savory layered tasty ensemble. \n\nI bought two to share, and everyone was happy, even the next day when reheated.

All takeout in response to Covid protocols, it has a decent kitchen if you are looking for something beyond the ordinary menu. Yet, it is far from perfect, and the actual Yelp score is closer to 3.5 Stars when taking all sampled dishes into consideration. \n\nI really enjoyed the Beef with Hot Peppers. The meat was tender, the sauce nicely spiced (but, not to Szechuan heat levels), and the onion and carrot thin slices made for a pleasant blend of flavor and texture. The Orange Chicken was abundant, and about average for the genre. It was all white meat with orange peel in the dark brown saucy mix, which was appreciated so much more than some who use cheaper dark meat as a loss leader. Unfortunately, the Wonton Soup destroyed the overall evaluation, because it was hardly worth consuming. It was salty bouillon and thick skinned dumplings, with indescribable meat filling that almost took my appetite away. \n\nSo, avoid the soups that have probably been sitting around too long, and focus on their special dishes not usually found on the universal Chinese American menu.  There you may find a number of choices that demonstration the real skills in the Wing Wah wok.",

A small card with instructions is attached with a mini clothespin. Cute!\n\nSo, why not a perfect score? The store experience is a bit overdone. Before the door closes, a voice welcomes you to NBC, and directs you to the free samples. I had to look for the person talking to me who was behind the high counter. She took away my attention while scanning the shop, making me a little uncomfortable. I prefer a moment to orient myself before the friendly sales assault. Too, I did not relate to the scripted welcome. Better to allow the store to speak for itself, grab the imagination, and then offer a more natural approach by staff. \n\nAlso, if you look at the photos from the company, the top of each cake has a icing plug across the normal opening from the Bundt pan. Looks good. Our reality was no such cap over the hole, but just a deep well to the bottom of the cake. It was iced, like a snow covered vent from a volcano. \n\nNo mistake, our lemon Bundt was excellent. These babies are patently addictive.  A few adjustments and the experience could be completely unforgettable.",

We ordered enough to be able to sample a cross section of their dishes, and had plenty to bring home for our sons. We went with: Deep Fried Chicken, Fish Fillet Dry Pot, Cumin Lamb and Hot Sauce Pig Intestine; all melded together with the help of an excellent Charles Krug cabernet (BYOB). Each entre was a full load. The chicken was crispy, yet still moist within. The fish fillets, tender with plenty of dry Szechuan red peppers, cauliflower, lotus root and cilantro. The cumin lamb was well covered in dry cumin leaf and accessorized with green pepper, onion and good sized long hots pieces, while the intestine skin was dark brown, surrounded by celery, peanuts, scallion and more of those small red heat devils from Chongqing. All tasty morsels. \n\nIf there was anything to talk about, it was the lack of numbing heat in any of the platters. A deep dive into the heart of each failed to discover any black peppercorn, nor star peppers - the two ingredients necessary for the development of numbing sweats.  When asked, we advised that they should bring the heat because we loved the sensation, yet it did not materialize. Spicy, yes. Numbing lips and tongue, no. \n\nBut, aside from that disappointment, the meal was filling, satisfying and most enjoyable. We will still return, and visit the sister ship before too long. Perhaps, we will bring our own extra burn, just in case the kitchen lacks those key ingredients when we arrive next time.",

    "text": "Samarkand is an ancient city in Uzbekistan in western Asia.  It sits astride the Silk Road that Marco Polo travelled on his journeys to the East.  It remains a beautiful and mysterious place with many old walls, narrow streets and amazing markets.  As a centuries old melting pot, it has created its own cultural reality; among the most interesting of which is food.  Taking from cuisine as far away as India, China and the Middle East, their kitchens at once remind you of each of those unique tastes, and at the same time something quite original.  \n\nA visit to Samarkand Restaurant is a much easier way to experience this exotic taste, than to make the overland caravan to this still isolated treasure.  Right in Bucks County the flavor and texture of Uzbeki dishes are available in a house with archways and desert murals that with a little imagination brings you right there. True, this is just the northern outpost of an ever expanding community of Soviet emigres who have settled in Northeast Philly, of which Uzbeks are but a part. Still, some would argue they are the most colorful and delicious. Leave that discussion for others while you take a trip to a terrific meal. \n\nOur approach was to tapas the appetizers, including mushroom and white corn soup, samsa, cheburek and kutab, followed by lamb and salmon shish kebob.  We shared everything. Service was friendly and attractive in Russian accent. \n\nEach element was very good to outstanding. Their use of dough to make all the apps was fascinating, as each was different and flavorful, depending on whether baked, deep fried or skillet heated. The lamb and salmon managed to be moist and well grilled at the same time. Excellent hands in the kitchen. \n\nWe finished lunch with their crepe dessert, stuffed with mildly sweet and sour cream, and drizzled with Nutella. It caused a nostalgia wave as sensory images of my grandmother's cheese blintzes danced in my head. Loved them! \n\nFew of us have broad exposure to Uzbek cuisine, but I intend to spend more time exploring it, as it is quite unusual, fun and delicious.",

    "text": "Seo Rabol, the Korean house on Old 2nd Street in the Olney section of Philadelphia, is one of the more established peninsula restaurants in the area. It is not far from the center of Seoultown on Cheltenham Avenue. They offer a full menu, but their specialty is BBQ grilled on the table. \n\nWe were not hungry enough to deal with the mandatory 2 order minimum (@$20 per), so opted for their rendition of seafood pancake and pork gui - letting them do the grilling in the kitchen and serve it ready to eat. The banchan arrived first in small square plates. The ten or so dishes were all very good and a tour de force of spicy flavors and textures from steamed egg to mackerel. \n\nThe pancake was frittata like, with plenty of shellfish within, and pan fried well enough to be firm, yet still tender. It was one of the better versions I have eaten. The gui was a large bowl full of pork strips grilled just right with an excellent spicy hot/sweet sauce. Much better than I could have done myself at the table, at less than half the cost. It was delicious and almost addictive. We couldn't finish either dish, so the remains were packed up for home consumption. We finished with complementary sweet ginger tea, which cleansed the pallet and was refreshing.\n\nThroughout the meal the large HDTVs were tuned to the Winter Olympics in South Korea. National pride for sure, but no one really seemed to be watching. The table conversation was dominant across the large dining room, as it should be while enjoying a good meal with family and friends. \n\nService was efficient and cordial, but it certainly helped to have someone at the table speaking Korean.",

Obviously developed without zoning, it is an alternate universe with mishmosh of industrial, pizza shops, dive bars, and marshes across the gypsy wagon shack landscape. It is strange and unique to this area, and Smokerhead Barbeque fits right in. \n\nIt is the second BBQ joint in this small shed, half kitchen and half dining room. The owners have been doing truck catering for a while and took a chance on bricks and mortar. From the look and smell of things, it was a smart move. They do solid smoked meats in a variety of styles, and love rock & roll. Last night they had a live performer cranking out hits from the 70's thru 90's on his well travelled Gibson and accompanying soundtrack. Decent gravel baritone voice, too. \n\nMy third of a rack ribs were four fat boys done St. Louis way, with sweet tangy flavor and far more than I could eat. There were only two table rockets with North Carolina (mustard base) and Memphis (brown sugar and vinegar) squirts. The meat was smoked dry and the sauces were optional, yet very moist and tender within. Really well done if you prefer control over the finish served up to you rather than having the plate all slathered with basting juices. The pit beans were a mix of grains, tomato base and bacon for seasoning. Good, but a little dry. \n\nService was down home and friendly. There was cool comraderie between the chefs and floor staff, and some dancing and harmonizing when a favorite tune struck a fancy.   Beer cans in the cooler, too. \n\nThoroughly entertained with ribs to spare last Saturday night.",

Since reopening earlier this year under new ownership, I have stopped in a few times for happy hour or later in the evening with friends and associates for after meeting meetings and socializing.  \n\nWhile I really did not like, \"The Temp,\" before due to its heavy political personality, the new version is much more friendly to all invitees, and offers a few small back rooms for groups to get together with quality bar and kitchen service.  We were there last night for a couple of hours to catch up after last week's national elections (more commiseration, than celebration).  Our server was warm and efficient, and the food and drink were good and reasonably priced.  \n\nFrom our vantage point behind the barroom, we heard the live band playing in the bar, but not loud enough to interfere with conversation.  Entering and leaving, I spied several people I knew from around town, and we acknowledged each other with nod, smile or wave. They were all having a good time.  \n\nNow that the vibe is more welcoming, a check on their dinner menu is in order.  Hope it, too, is more warm and tasty than the dusty dryness of past party clubbiness.",

Sitting at the corner of County Line and Newtown Roads in Warminster, PA, it has recently expanded into the neighboring storefront to add a utilitarian dining room in addition to the small original corner shop. \n\nI stopped in when I couldn't find the Mexican place I was searching for, and decided to go in flying blind. Very glad I did, because while really nothing like Mexican food, it did have a strong resemblance to Puerto Rican cuisine with serious pork, chicken and beef options, and white/yellow/brown rice and well simmered beans. While it all looked appealing, I was most attracted to the rotisserie quartered chicken.  \n\nIt was excellent. Its skin was dry and taunt, while the meat beneath was moist and pull-from-the-bone tender. The taste was subtle, but well spiced and easy to pull apart and devour. If you said it was like duck comfit, you wouldn't be wrong. The beans were also delicious, but not spicy, and the yellow rice mixed in for a tasty textured combination. Liked the meal a lot. \n\nService was friendly and attractive, and although ordered at the cashier, it was delivered to the table with a sonrisa grande by their Guatemaltecan assistant. \n\nThere were many other interesting possibilities that may tempt me to return. I saw tostones, empanadas, and platanos rellenos, that looked great.  I just can't eat that much, and much prefer eating at the source to carry out. \n\nNew Mama Juana is the name. Authentic Latin American island food is the game.",

    "text": "I generally leave New Hope for the New York weekenders and tourists to overpopulate, but sometimes on a Sunday night in the dead of winter the village empties and it is possible to find open tables for a quiet dinner that reminds of this ferrytown's historic beginnings. So it was this weekend past that we ventured into this picturesque river hamlet and found a nearly vacant The Dubliner on the Delaware Irish bar and kitchen on North Main Street. Parking was a breeze almost right in front, and the meter was was only needed until 9. \n\nWe chose a table overlooking the main drag along the front paned glassed wall. The street lights did their best to add a warm glow on a softly raining night. This 18th Century town somehow looked like the perfect set for a movie about the real revolutionary history that happened all along the river when the New Hope Ferry was the only way across the dangerous Delaware's current and icy flow. It was a wilder river then before a reliable bridge could be built. \n\nService was friendly, helpful and appropriate. We ordered a Guinness for an Irish brew novice and a Magnate Hard Pear Cider pour moi. Cool, tasty refreshing. From there, we ordered Shepherds Pie, Bangars & Mash, Crab Cake Sandwich and a fresh Cod Fillet with veggie accompaniment. They were all a big hit with the group, especially the first two. This house knows from mashed potatoes and does them quite well. The Shepherds Pie had plenty of ground beef, peas, carrots and brown gravy under the topside frilly  potato cover. Made me wish I had a flock of sheep so I could justify eating this substantial deep dish meal more often. It was fun and delicious. \n\nThe Irish sausage atop the same mashed came with a small dish of gravy, that when all mixed together made for another engaging and nearly addicting mouthful. I was permitted a taste and found it eye openingly exceptional. The Crab Cake was also good with far more crab than bread filler. The Cod was light but could have used a more flavorful finish to give it more spark. \n\nWe all agreed that our meals at The Dubliner were overall better than expected, and that a return visit would be an easy vote of assent. Those burgers looked great, too. \n\nPS: This is the former Mother's Restaurant location, where I had been a semi regular at an earlier point in my life. I admit to approaching the heavy wood door with thoughts of those days and wondering if memories would haunt. Nope. Once inside the new energy of the joint took control and assured that this was a new day for this old haven and the ghosts that be were friendly.",

    "text": "Sedition is conduct that encourages acts of rebellion against the state. If a failure it is a serious crime; if successful, an act of revolutionary heroism. In times like these that try the souls of patriots, when it is difficult to differentiate between the criminals and the righteous, it is understandable that a subterranean public house would choose \"Sedition\" as its identity. No doubt the dark bricked, grottoed, underground tavern evokes an epoch when such weighty matters were discussed in hushed tones by serious people. \n\nChose a side or stand aside, but at least here you can do so with quality drinks and kitchen. We stopped in after visiting Penn Med a few blocks away. The basement felt cool in the dim light of reimagined industrial fixtures. We walked through coved rooms until taking a booth rather far from the bar. Yet, the friendly bartender found us with menus in hand. There were good beer choices, but having to return to see the medical staff after lunch, our libations were strictly water. We ordered the Philbano and Beer Braised Brisket sandwiches, and settled in. \n\nBoth were very good, as were the accompanying fries. The \"Philly Cubano\" was made up of smoked Berkshire pork butt, provolone, peach BBQ sauce and pickled long hots, all stuffed into a fresh Parker House roll. Simply put, it was a great pulled pork sammy. The combination of ingredients played well together and it was fun to identify the flavors as they announced themselves to the tongue.  First rate. The brisket was not quite as entertaining, but was tender and slathered in horseradish and coleslaw between the semi spheres of a brioche bun. Satisfying. Both were substantial enough to bring half home. \n\nWhether you intend on sedition or will wait the next act out from the sidelines, be sure to enjoy life and stop in to Sedition for drinks and grub before deciding.",

Some might say that it is also the true heart of Old New Castle, occupying a colonial building constructed in 1674, and operating as a bar/restaurant for at least the last 75 years. Jessop's is the perfect place to take a load off after exploring town, or as a way station just minutes of Rt. 95 south of Wilmington.  \n\nReflecting the cultural mix of the early settlers, the offerings are from Sweden, The Netherlands, England, Belgium, and Revolutionary War Americana.  They have a large beer selection, with Belgians their claim to fame.  The kitchen is similarly oriented to traditional fare from those parts of the world.  As they say in their Mission Statement, they \"serve history at Jessop's Tavern.\"  \n\nWe stopped in for a late lunch last week after touring Rockwood Mansion, about 12 miles north. It was all dark woods and wenches in period dress.  A long bar along one wall, and tables against the other.  We ordered a dark Barbe ale and pear cider for drinks, and their, \"Dutch Pastrami Reuben,\" and Swedish Meatloaf Sandwich.  Both were large, beautiful to behold, and solid tasty meals.  Every aspect was well designed from breads through sauces, although it was not apparent what the Dutch have to do with pastrami, but, they are entitled to a little poetic license. \n\nService was attentive and friendly. When a late afternoon cloudburst trapped us in the tavern just after we finished eating, they had no problem inviting us to stay as long as we liked, and offering us an umbrella to go to the car once the deluge passed.  \n\nHear tell that they also have excellent ice cream available.  \n\nThere will definitely be a next time.",

But, realizing it wasn't wise to go food shopping on an empty stomach, we stopped in at M Kee for a late lunch.  This was a first visit for me, and I found the house to be cleaner and friendlier than most.  The menu was packed with rice and noodle dishes, wet and dry, and at prices that were very compatible with the desire to eat light.  \n\nMy friends speak little English, but felt right at home chatting up the servers about the menu and how dishes were prepared.  Once satisfied, they went with Chicken Curry over Rice, Roast Pork and Wonton Noodle Soup (See Photos). \n\nThe Chicken arrived in a bright yellow almost creamy curry sauce, and a pleasantly mild flavor that only required a little tweaking with Sriracha to bring up the heat.  Tasty.  The Wonton Noodles Soup was more than I could finish, with a nest of thin noodles beneath the surface of the chicken consume.  The 4 or 5 Wontons were stuffed with ground Pork and Leek (maybe), and had goldfish tails for swimming in the hot broth.  Very nice.  Finally, the Roast Pork was excellent covered in a gleaming tawny finish.  There was a lot of it for under 7 bucks, and it was the star of the show.  \n\nIt was easy to see why M Kee is so popular.  The quantity/quality/cost proposition is great here.  The three of us walked out with tip for under $20, totally sated and agreeing this was great down home victuals.  With prices this low, it almost doesn't pay to eat in my own kitchen.",

It is part of the Carlucci restaurant empire, the local folks who brought us Mama Rosa's, Carlucci's, Carlucci's Express, this lovely place and a couple of kitchens in the old country. Word is that the old man was in the house just this morning checking on operations. His kids are starting to pick up their involvement as he starts to cut back. Sorry I missed him. \n\nOf course, I didn't know any of this history until informed by our server after I asked about all the Carlucci photos on the walls. Had I known, I would have checked MMT out long ago. Now that I have, I won't be a stranger. \n\nThe house is casually attractive with two dining areas and a nice cozy feel. The menu is extensive and the kitchen visible along the western wall. We were here for a late lunch that would bypass dinner. We chose a personal size 12\" white veggie pie and eggplant parmesan foot long sandwich/grinder to share. \n\nBoth were really good.  The pie was a beauty, with colorful components and a garlicky aroma. The crust was crisp, firm, yet airy. Good cheese veggie balance that did not let the fromage bog down the lightness desired. A sprinkle of crushed red pepper and we got down to business. \n\nThe melanzon was thin sliced, breaded and pan sauteed before being slid into a fresh Italian torpedo roll, top layered with mozza, splashed with chunky tomato gravy, and then placed in the pizza oven to finish it off with a melt and mild scorching of the roll edges. Great soft texture beneath the slight crustiness of the breading. Honest flavorful interplay between the elements. \n\nIf you already know the Carlucci experience at his other shops, MMT will not surprise you with it quality take on traditional Italian cuisine. They are similar, so like one, like all. If new to Carlucci World, this is an excellent place to begin your affair with his kitchens.",

They do pizza, steaks and related goodies, and that is all. No pasta. No dinners. Nothing fancy. Just old style pie and sandwiches in a double wide storefront on Woerner Avenue, Levittown, PA.  If you know this commercial strip, you are aware it is not the most attractive bit of design and construction every created. Signage can't be seen from the main roads, and even the street seems more like an alleyway between New Falls Road and Emilie Road. \n\nBut, if you are in the mood for a throwback Italian experience, Pizza Star is the joint for you. Ordering is at the counter, and table service is provided by the kitchen staff. No waitresses here. Just find a table and settle in. The HDTV high on the front wall will keep you informed or entertained. \n\nI went with their eggplant parmesan sub. There was only one size available - large, but the price was about the same as for a torpedo half the size. Hard to beat. When delivered to my seat, it looked great. Overloaded with melanzone - breaded thin slices, saut\u00e9ed in olive oil and covered in mozza and their home brewed red sauce.  The roll was first rate, too; brought to highlife with the final bronzing in the oven. \n\nTaste was very good, although the golden fried discs were perhaps a little too oily from their moment in the hot sun. Not a biggie, but it would have been near excellent had the oil been absorbed off before the sandwich was finished. \n\nThe Star is yet another strong find in this part of Lower Bucks. No doubt I will return to sample the steaks and pizza when I find myself hungry in this sector of the universe.",

The bagel was fresh, but the soft variety, rather than the crisp chew I prefer. Still, it was acceptable and I enjoyed it. The Brownie was likewise soft, but nicely chocolatey throughout. Half was covered with powdered sugar, giving it a sweet kick without overwhelming the basic premise of these brown squares. Finally, the Joe was hot and tasty from the light roast, which I often like more than the stronger heavier darker roasts. \n\nBottom line, this was a decent late morning snack for a busy day, and I won't hesitate to visit again next time I am near The College.",

    "text": "Pho Viet HOA on Welsh Road, Willow Grove, sits in the middle of a modern strip center right next door to an Italian restaurant; one of the beautiful things about the melting pot we live in. Its modern utilitarian decor makes room for a dozen tables along both walls, with enough seating for social distancing in these Days of Covid. Service was prompt and efficient, with a suburban smile. The menu was primarily Vietnamese as would be expected, but also delved into a broader culinary universe found in neighboring Asian kitchens like Chinese and Thai style noodle dishes. \n\nI ordered Veggie Fried Rolls as an appetizer, Wide Noodles with Veggies \"Wet\" in a light brown sauce, and two Banh Mi sandwiches, Grilled Beef and Pork (for family take out). I hesitated on their Pho based on the luke warm reviews from respected Yelpers and the price compared to favorite pho houses in the City, which were a few bucks less. \n\nThe four Veggie Rolls and dipping sauce were very good, crisp and full of real chopped veggies, and not just cabbage. The garnish of daikon and carrot were a nice touch. The large plate of fat noodles was supplied with ample broccoli, carrot, onion, mushroom and sprout, but lacking in spice. My mistake for not requesting lemongrass be added, but I squirted on Sriracha from the table rocket to compensate. Not precisely the flavor profile I hoped for, but decent enough to satisfy. I took half of that home. \n\nThe uncompromising winner were the Banh Mi consumed by the family later in the evening. They were both stuffed with excellent roast pork and beef, cucumber, daikon, carrot, cilantro and a tasty mix of hot/sweet sauces, all barely contained in fresh (if not exactly French), rolls. Baguettes would have been near perfection. Compared to what we ate the week before from another Vietnamese/Thai house, this was Blue Ribbon. \n\nSo, go for the Banh Mi for sure, perhaps not for their specials noodle list, while the jury is out on the Pho. I wouldn't hesitate to give it a try as long as the sammies were the primary focus. \n\nP.S. The Banh Mi were eaten before photos could be secured. Apologies.",

    "text": "This Steve's Prince of Steaks is on Comly Road, just off northbound Roosevelt Boulevard, Somerton, PA, in the far Northeast of the city. If possible, it is even smaller than my regular Steve's on Rt. 1 in Langhorne. There are two windows within. One for ordering your sandwich, for which they have posted a long list of rules to follow to get what you want, and the other only for fries and drinks. Like the rest, the burden is on you to know what you're doing, or face the consternation of the staff and your fellow steak lovers. Not an enviable place to be.\n\nI ordered two \"cheesesteaks wit provolone,\" meaning I wanted two sandwiches with fried onions and provolone cheese. I like the Wiz, too, but preferred the extra mellowness offered by the hard white variation. It set me back $25+. Not unexpected, but I'd be lying if I didn't do a double clutch before paying the dude taking my business. \n\nNormally, we would eat right along the walls at the Langhorne joint, but this shop was smaller and without short shelves and stools. We took them home to consume. These guys are fast and efficient, and it was fun to watch them work through the greasy glass window that separates kitchen from customers. It would have been a thoroughly enjoyable moment, but for Mr. Priss shouting not to take photos (after the last one). \n\nOh, me. Oh, my! Have to protect those state secrets. \n\nAt home, we added our own banana pepper rings to bring up the burn; the pickle bar being removed as a casualty of COVID. It was love at first bite. Great cross section of taste and texture as we incisored through the excellent torpedo roll, cheese and ribeye. My wife and I shared one sandwich, and left the other for her still growing son (6'3\"). \n\nI have no dog in the fight between the chopped vs. solid slice approach to this Philly delicacy. I like them both ways, as long as the beef used is high quality. Steve's is among my faves, but with every pizza shop making their own version, we are really living in Cheesesteak Heaven around here. The worst one in the Philadelphia region is better than anything anywhere else.",

    "text": "One thing for sure - Water's Edge does Covid Protocol right! \n\nWalking up the stairs to the main entrance you first see a large squirt bottle of hand sanitizer to clean hands before touching the door handle. In the lobby, your temperature is taken and then your driver's license scanned in case they need to notify the county health department to do contact tracing because they learn someone in your party developed Covid symptoms. Then they escort you to a bar stool or table properly distanced from the others. Everyone on staff is masked and gloved. As put to me; \"We're dead serious about following protocol. We want to do everything required to keep our restaurant open and keep customers and staff safe.\" \n\nGreatly appreciated! \n\nSo, we took a table outside on a chilly evening. Not only did we want fresh air to maximize safety, but we wanted to overlook the wide and muddy Bensalem Creek which the new owners had gone great lengths to accentuate with the tri-level deck between the banks of the creek and all glass back wall of the restaurant. On a warmer night in season, this would be almost idyllic. \n\nA portable heater was wheeled over to us and sparked on overhead. It took the cold edge off the air, but didn't reach our legs, so we accepted that this would be a somewhat cold experience. Made the night more memorable. \n\nWe ordered the brussel sprout appetizer (smallish sprouts with bacon and parmesan mixed in), Tuscon Salmon (wild rice and asparagus), and the Five Alarm Burger w Fries (candied jalapeno slices, cheese, and an aioli spread on the brioche-style bun). They were all good, if not knock outs, but better than expected from a kitchen attached to what is fundamentally a sports pub with an excellent view. \n\nService was very gracious and attentive. I felt a bit guilty forcing the young woman to come outside to help us when she lacked any true winter wear. She didn't complain, nor even show she was frigid. I hoped a larger tip would provide evidence we appreciated her effort. \n\nWill return with better weather for sure.",

    "text": "The old stable is now populated by diners enjoying the bucolic, high beamed ceiling, stone floors and exposed kitchen.  If outdoor dining in nice weather is your thing, you can be easily accommodated next to the boccie court and outdoor bar. \n\nIt seems I am there most often for special community events, and the layout works well for isolating small groups in places that do not overly interfere with the regular dinner patrons.  The food is family style Italian, meaning if there are more than 3 of you, many of the dishes come piled high and placed centrally on the table where everyone can partake. \n\nThe food has always been solid, both meats, fowl and pasta.  The service is much better than average, with black and whites hustling around to be sure everyone is getting what they expect in a timely and friendly, while professional manner.  The last event buffet consisted of Chicken Francaise, Vodka Rigatoni, Eggplant Rolatini, Grilled Veggies, Italian Bread.  All worth the price of admission.  \n\nSure glad someone thinks enough of their guests to schedule a social/political event in such pleasant surroundings.",

    "text": "We just purchased a new Toro self-propelled lawn mower from Tanners on Rt. 532 in Newtown.  You may remember the location as the former Yamamoto's. \n\nI walked in after our tired out mower's metal tube handle snapped from fatigue, and it became impossible to push it further.  The guys at Tanners showed me what they had to offer in a quiet, knowledgeable way.  They appreciated my frustration, and after asking appropriate questions to zero in on my lawn cutting requirements, directed me to a Toro.  There was a small rebate being offered by the manufacturer, to bring the cost in line with the big boxes out on Rt. 1.  I always prefer to buy locally, and keep the businesses in town open.  A small premium for that satisfaction is well worth it. \n\nTanners delivered the mower to my home yesterday, fully operational, with a full tank of gas, and road tested.  They took away my old mower, and we agreed that if they could repair it for under a certain amount they should do so, and my 12 year old would have a second machine for his budding lawn cutting business.  If not, they would give me a small trade in offset.  Fair deal. \n\nWhen I arrived home my son ran out of the house with a big smile.  He had already cut two lawns with the new mower, and he was in love with his first machine.  We had a sharp cut lawn and a happy boy who had just gone through a right of passage.  \n\nAll this and a new Toro ballcap, too. \n\nNothing better than that!",

    "text": "Sabrina's Pizza took me by surprise.  I mean, I knew it was there, but I never considered checking it out until very recently.  \n\nNow, I've had lunch there twice in one week, and it could easily become one of my regular stops for tomato pie or other midday meal.  Hamilton has dozens of decent small Italian joints that put out the standard fare, and it takes a lot of tasting to distinguish them from each other. Eventually, the better shops emerge above the rest and the circle of good restaurants finally closes.  If embarrassment of riches makes any sense for pizza parlors, this part of the world has it. That doesn't mean that other cities don't do it as well or maybe better (You know who you are). Still, I have come to appreciate the richness of the pizza/tomato pie tradition around here. \n\nWhat about the food, you ask?  The Eggplant Parm Sandwich I had a few days ago was thin sliced, fine ground bread crumb coating and individually olive oil saut\u00e9ed purple nightshade, placed in a fresh torpedo and topped with plenty of mozza cheese and a chunky tomato gravy.  Totally a knife and fork experience.  With an iced tea, it comes in at just under ten bucks.  \n\nToday's bar pie size Tomato Pie with Italian Sweet Sausage was even better.  It arrived in the hands of the owner/chef on a large ceramic plate, all steamy - a cloud of garlic infused vapors fogging my glasses and attacking my senses.  The crust was firm and crunchy, and even with the extra load of lumpy gravy and ground meat, managed to hold a firm point through most of the meal.  It was excellent and really tasted like it was made in Nonna's kitchen.  \n\nIf there is anything to pic a nit about it would be that the pie might have been even better with a little less on top.  The tomato sauce was so chunky that it remained moist on the finished disk and as it cooled and released it water condensate, the remaining slices softened and weakened its ability to hold its load. There was actually a bit of water left over as the pie was consumed, and it lost its crunch.  \n\nSometimes, less is more.",

It is larger, fresher, tastier, and the biscuits themselves flakier and more buttery.  \n\nThis was a drive thru order at this newish outlet.  They made a small mistake in my favor by throwing in a box of Taters at the bottom of the bag.  I didn't order them, but neither was I charged.  I wasn't aware of it until I arrived at my destination and saw what was in the bag.  \n\nNice to come out on the high side of the transaction.  So often, these deals break the other way.",

    "text": "Chencha Y Chole is a very nice Mexican house at the corner of Broad and Cass in Trenton.  It has been open for several months and still has the \"Grand Opening\" signs hanging on the sides of the newly painted triangular building.  The odd angle of this intersection created an opportunity for the original architect and city planner to design a structure that fits snuggly in this narrow corner, thus adding interesting perspective to the establishment.\n\nInside is clean and bright and feels like a bit of sunny Mexico right here in River City.  The menu is diverse, and the plates leaving the open kitchen are equally colorful, and more importantly, very tasty.  I asked for my Hawaiian Torta with Grilled Chicken rather than jamon, and was easily accommodated.  The sandwich arrived loaded with bird, avocado, onion, lettuce, queso fresca ,fried pineapple, spicy mayo, and a few other unidentifiables that added to the overall finished product.  The toasted Roll made the entire package very enjoyable.  It came with good Fries. \n\nMost surprisingly delicious was the homemade Tamarindo drink.  While I thought I was ordering a carbonated bottled of soda, in fact, I was getting something much better.  The Tamarind was cool, mildly sweet and tart, and so very refreshing.  It arrived in a large glass and was a mid-brown shade from the tree pods it was reduced from. Also, very high in antioxidants.  It is great to be so pleasantly overwhelmed.  \n\nSerendipity.  This is one of the best Mexican joints I have tried in the city. \n\n4 Stars with a Bullet!",

    "text": "I have a memory of being in this place about twenty years ago, and it looking very different back then.  I don't remember if it was McCool's or another name, but for sure it was a much darker and dingier dive in those days.  Today, there are large windows along the back wall letting in some light, and the bar has been moved to the inner wall to permit that to happen.  The place still has that old pub feel, all dark woods and lots of draft beer handles and liquor bottles on the back bar shelves.  \n\nYes. Plenty of choices, and a decent menu, too.  When I stopped in around 1 for lunch before a meeting a few blocks away, there was only one other guy at the bar, and one table occupied.  Those people were gone before I finished, leaving me to have a good conversation with Heather, the bartender.  This is one of the benefits of late lunches. Miss the happy hour, but befriend the bartenders, and ask lots of questions. \n\nVery cool that she has been there 13 years, joining the crew shortly after the old place was purchased by the current owners who made all the structure changes seen today.  Turns out the hosts are Greek and do a very good take on the tavern comfort foods coming out of the basement kitchen.  I'm told the new dumbwaiter was installed fairly recently, saving a load of stair climbing to serve customers.  \n\nI had a Summer Love draft and the house Macaroni and Cheese for a light meal.  The former was cool, mildly complex and easy going down, and the later, hot, cheesy and served in the same crockery as the French Onion Soup.  Although an app, it filled me amply, and left room for a coffee stop on my way to the meeting on Market St.  \n\nI was very happy with my short sojourn at McCool's.  In its quiet unassuming way, it is a nice haven from the street hustle, and in a similar vein, a pleasant alternative to the louder vanity stops that abound in Center City.  \n\nThe reincarnation has gone very well.",

    "text": "Newtown Farmers' Market is an overcrowded, under-maintained, slightly tarnished version of the Amish markets in the Lancaster area.  They have proliferated to other locales around Bucks, but this was one of the first.  Honestly, it needs a refurbishment, as it gets dingier by the month. \n\nYet, there are a few stalls where the food product is original and tasty.  Barbie's Soft Pretzels is one of them.  They don't have a sign anywhere near the shop, but if you know your way around, it is right across from the sushi place near the main entrance.  Lately, I have become slightly addicted to their Jalapeno, Onion and Cheese Pretzel Dog.  They claim it to be a beef hot dog encased within a soft pretzel shell, with the Jalapeno Slices, Saut\u00e9ed Onion and Melted Cheese all stuffed within the pretzel. The current price is $2.50 per, and it seems a good deal.  The pretzel is the same as you can get as a traditional twist, but the taste and texture are strongly influenced by the contents within.  Each bite comes at you with succeeding sensibilities of slightly salty pretzel, the garlicy dog, with a rush of jalapeno arriba, and finally the subtle cheese to finish each chomp/chew.  Damn enjoyable with each repetition. \n\nToday, they had a special on Blueberry Shakes (in season), so why not?  I watched the young freulein put in two scoops of vanilla ice cream (they have their own supply right next to the Goodnoe case - they should work out a deal to use the local iconic brand), and then a copious amount of Blueberry mash.  She blended it for at least two minutes.  The taste was superlative with the straw constantly clogging with the sapphire blue berry slurry.  The best moment was when extra suction was applied to my end of the straw and the blockage finally gave way and exploded in my mouth. \n  \nIn my munchies days, that would have blown my mind. \n\nSo, yes, I am a fan of Barbie's.  Yet, I wish they kept their stall cleaner.  As I stood and looked down into the lemonade machine, the clear sight of mold in the corners gave me pause.  It had not been cleaned well in ages.  Sigh...\n\nI ate my lunch anyway, as I felt the obligation to post this review.",

But, if you are fortunate enough to peer through the large storefront glass you will find a small utilitarian banh mi house that turns out a superior Vietnamese sandwich and a very good smoothie, too.  \n\nI walked in for a late lunch before my scheduled haircut around the corner looking for a good baguette based sandy made with skilled hands knowledgeable in the ways of Saigon fare.  I lucked out.  \n\nLola is the young daughter of the owners of this shop.  The couple running the operation are very friendly and informative about their vision for the business and how they create their dishes.  I had the Roast Pork Banh Mi.  It came complete with in house baked pork roast sliced thin and amply placed in fresh French loaf.  The Daikon radish, Cucumber, Cilantro and Mayo were in there, too.  The bread was slighted warmed, and perhaps spread with a touch of butter or oil to bring up the flavor of the opus.  \n\nI learned that the roast pork starts as a raw ground meat that is mixed with spices and baked in the home oven for several hours before being sliced and used as the foundation for their sandwich.  It is not a \"deli meat\" at all, but done fresh by the owners as needed.  \n\nIt was an excellent banh mi, perhaps the best I have sampled in Chinatown, and on par with those down around Washington in South Philly.  The Pineapple-Banana Smoothie was thick, cool and so refreshing. I walked around with it after lunch and was great on an above average mid October afternoon.  At $4 per BM and Smoothie, the prices were right!\n\nLola's is worth many return visits to see what else they do in the kitchen.  \n\n4 Stars with a Bullet!",

Imagine my relief to realize there was a bakery right next door. It was like finding an emergency rescue squad right next to a bad auto accident.  \n\nCairo Cakes is a small shop.  There was a steady flow of customers as I waited, asked questions of the helpful man in white, and made my selections.  The display cases were full of cupcakes, and trays of various brownies and bars.  I jumped at the Lemon Bars, always a favorite.  The Chocolate Peanut Butter and something that tasted like German Chocolate filling with Toasted Coconut Shredded Wheat-like topping, also found their way into my box.  Finally, I picked up a couple of colorful cupcakes for my son to give his mom for a little treat on Mother's Day.  \n\nEverything I tasted was very good, if a little too dense for my palate.  The flavors were all strong and addicting, but they had a cloying stickiness that required a hot drink to clear from the tongue and teeth.  I would have preferred a lighter texture while maintaining the flavors, as can be found in many bakeries.  \n\nStill, this is a nice place to come for sweets in the area, and it certainly saved me from suffering the long term aftereffects of the lousy pizza put out next door.

    "text": "First bite at Casa Lupita was a little unusual. \n\nI walked in for a late lunch and the large banquet/dining area looked like it was between weddings - all white tablecloths with pink bows and ribbons everywhere.  But, to one side near the kitchen a few tables had been left aside for the day/evening crowd to use.  The only other person in the house at 2 was Alicia, the chef, server, manager, and Jacquelina of all trades.  \n\nShe was Aces.  She took my order for Sopes de Pollo with Black Beans and Rice on the side, and disappeared into the kitchen to make my lunch.  It was only when I heard the rumbling in the kitchen and she finally emerged with a tray loaded down with my almuertzo and placed it before me that I realized what was going on. She played all the parts of this theatrical production. \n\nEverything was very good.  The thick corn tortilla used as the base for the Sopes was freshly baked and was strong enough to hold the open face of the Chicken, Beans, Lettuce, Tomato and Grated Cheese that was piled onto each of the three 5 inch diameter disks.  The Mexican spices announced themselves in their splendid red and green, and two small dishes of Salsa waited patiently to be thrown into the flames.  So good.  The Black Beans and Golden Rice were ample, satisfying and filling.  My Mandarin Jarritos reminded my why it was my favorite carbonated drink - the fruit flavors always come through in a way that the Americano alternatives just do not.  \n\nWhile I consumed this excellent repast, Alicia sat at the next table and chatted with me about the shop and her life since coming here from Cuidad Mexico more than 20 years ago.  She was bright, charming, and had a confident air that was compelling. I thought she was the owner of this hall, but alas, only a very motivated employee.  Impressive, nonetheless.\n\nCasa Lupita is 4 Stars with a bullet.  It may be the best of the Casas Mexicanas I have sampled to date.  \n\nIt will be hard to keep me away.",

    "text": "Visiting Skippack Village for the first time to sample the local vineyards fare at Winetober Fest (Thank you for the tix, Yelp Philly), we finally had our fill and needed a place to get off our feet, and eat something. \n\nAfter a few hours surrounded by fellow inebriants (have you ever been someplace where the entire ville is drunk?) we found Brasserie 73 in the center of town.  Even before walking in the door we passed a large patio out front. Had it been a warmer evening, that would have been our choice.  However, dining inside was an exceptionally pleasant experience.  The bar/dining room is large, with high ceilings, dark woods, and a definitely continental air. We had a corner table under the front windows where we could watch the winding down of the festival out on the street, while we admired the old world elegance within.  \n\nService was good with a knowledgeable waiter and bustling staff.  \n\nThe meal started off auspiciously with a very seasonal Pumpkin Bisque presented inside a locally grown pumpkin.  It was very nicely done with a creamy base and lots of veggies, sunflower seeds and bacon.  Really tasty!  The Salade du Maison was a spring mix with a light balsamic dressing.  Also decent.  We waited a bit longer than expected for the shared main course, Farfalle with Jumbo Shrimp, Tomato, Sundried and regular, Artichoke, Fennel, and Basil.  This dish was underwhelming given the ingredients, and what came before it.  It felt flat and lifeless. \n\nI inquired of our wait person about the inconsistency in the quality of the dishes.  He was prepared for it.  He explained that the establishment had gone through 3 ownership changes over the past few years, which accounted for changes in philosophy and ability.  There was a Head Chef change a few weeks ago.  They now had a primo chef from Philadelphia who was still using the old menu, and creating specials to complement it.  The new menu was not yet ready, so we were caught in the middle of the changeover.  The bisque was his baby - creative, rich and savory.  The pasta was off the old menu, and lacked energy.  If you read the other reviews beginning several years ago, you can see the ups and downs of the evolution here. \n\nThe new menu will be installed by November 1, 2013.  I recommend everyone wait until after that date to come for a big meal or a party.  Before that, pay attention to the specials, as ordering off the old sheet will likely prove disappointing. \n\nStill, a beautiful place to dine. Great wine list. Wonderful space. High prices.",

I have sampled many of their buns, cookies, bars, cakes, and they are all fun to eat.\n\nMy favorites are the Apple Cake which reminds me of the densely moist version my Yiddish grandmother made on most holidays, and the Lemon Bars which are equal parts tart and sweet with powdered sugar dusted on top, and a firm crunchy base.  \n\nBoth are addicting and require self control to make them last.",

    "text": "Oregon Market appears to be the sibling of Vietnamese market in the Wing Phat Shopping Mall at 11th and Washington, although perhaps a bit cleaner and easier to navigate.  It is connected via the small inner space between stores to the Pho Ha Saigon restaurant, so it is convenient to shop and eat (or vice versa).  \n\nIt always amazes me who much more variety of produce these Asian grocers have than the typical American supermarket.  Green leafies from peas, cabbage, lettuce, and every other form of vegetation are washed and bagged for consumption with any one of a score of sauces that go so well with the saut\u00e9ed end product that is often just discarded in the West.  What's more significant is that it all tastes great fresh from the wok.  \n\nQuite an eye opener.\n\nThe fresh fish is ready for inspection and selection.  The boxes of live Blue Claws await their delectable demise. \n\nIf you wonder if there is MSG in your dishes in Chinatown, just walk down the spice aisle and choose from among several large cans and boxes of the white powder.  It is more prevalent than salt.  \n\nIf you buy enough, when you go to the cashier you will be offered a free bottle or box of whatever they have in surplus that day.",

But, if you're not in the mood for tomato pie, Mom also does excellent homemade soup and fresh salads for the light diet crowd. \n\nSo, I went with a cup of roast chicken and rice soup and small salad with balsamic on the side. Both were very good, with the potage full of shredded bird and small grain white rice. The salad was big for a small, but brightly green and sprite. Eating in the small front of the shop was pleasant, as I was the only customer and could watch and chat with the proprietress as she worked. Although no longer in the store where the M. Night Shamalan movie, Signs, was shot, I still thought of the Mel Gibson scene where he too ate lunch in Mom's restaurant as he was discovering those crop circles in his fields. \n\nIt took me a long time to make it to the new Mom Mom's, but glad I finally did. Now that I have an office down State Street I will make it a point to visit with regularity. \n\nNext time, the pizza!",

    "text": "Spice C (Noodles) is a solid choice if you feel the need for well drawn or cut handmade pasta from the Middle Kingdom.  They are all about made to order dishes that highlight the taste, texture and quality of freshly made soups that feature noodles as their base.  Dry dishes are also available, and there is the choice of \"normal\" or \"Szechuan\" style bowls if part of your zest for slurp includes a high capzasin quotient. \n\nWe opted for the normal large bowl of Beef Soup with Hand Drawn Noodles with Wonton, their version of Szechuan Spicy Chicken, and Chicken, Pork & Shrimp Spring Rolls.  All three dishes were very good.  The soup was robust with well prepared beef broth and a nest of noodles hidden beneath the tranquil surface.  The thin skinned Wontons floated like pale goldfish.  Each aspect contributed fully to the final product.  Wontons were light and chewy.  The noodles required patience to lift and separate into manageable lengths. \n\nThe Chicken plate was generously endowed with thin sliced meat that was cooked just enough to optimal tenderness, and approaching killer spice levels with a black bean chili sauce.  Plenty of veggies in the mix that had completely absorbed their surroundings.  So much pleasurable heat that we ordered another one to take home.  The Spring Rolls were loaded with filling and fried in clean cooking oil that had no leftover taste other than these ingredients.  \n\nSpice C is worth a visit (or two) if you are looking for a soup oriented meal with a Chengdu flair.",

    "text": "Trenton has become a haven for excellent Latin American cuisine. Guatelinda on Clinton Avenue is one such locale where you can find totally authentic dishes that help you forget for a few moments that you are in the heart of Jersey, and feel that you are on the avenidas de Antigua Guatemala while you dine on delicious plates of nearly homemade fare.  \n\nWhen I walked in around 2 in the afternoon last week, I was not only the only Gringo in the house; I was the only customer.  I asked the guys behind the counter if lunch was still being served.  They spoke not a word of Ingles, so I tried again in my mostly forgotten Espanol.  I was good enough to be understood, and after a few smiles and nods I picked a table and sat facing the front window with a view of the house around me.  The large menu offered Spanish and English descriptions, and even a few photos of the offerings.  The server was very friendly (and cute) and worked with me in her broken English to put together my lunch.  \n\nThe platter of Tacos Guatemaltecos arrived loaded with three double tortilla soft folded wheat 'tillas full of well spiced grilled pork, onion, pepper, cilantro, and a few things I could not identify.  On top of the tacos were a half avocado, sliced radish, and a hot ghost pepper.  I doctored each with the accompaniments and went to work.  The combination was wonderful, with each part of the combo playing olfactory harmonics.  Hot, soft, crunchy, chewy, textured, smooth and cool - all in each bite.  It was great and fun to eat. \n\nThe JarritosTamarindo soda helped tamp down the overly hot spots.  Mexican pop is so much more flavorful than its northern counterparts.  It worked so well with its Guatemalan cousins. \n\nThere is a lot more on the menu I want to taste.  I will go back to this, as well as the two or three other very good shops in the area, to satisfy my lust for Central American food.  Don't let the streetscape outside deter you.  Guatelinda is the real deal.",

    "text": "I hadn't been inside Cross Keys Diner in at least a decade, but walking in it seemed like time stood still.  Everything looked and felt the same.  \n\nThis had always been a community center where locals stopped in for a meal along with their neighbors and business associates to enjoy the home cooking and the hominess of the d\u00e9cor.  It still is.  I sat on a spinner directly in front of the kitchen entrance and was immediately serviced by all the workers who were picking up orders or refilling their coffee mugs.  \n\nThe menu is diverse, but the real deal is in their breakfast specials.  I opted for the Thunder Cakes, made with a mix of fruit and nuts and a substantial pancake mix that made even the short stack (2 pancakes) more than I could manage.  The melted butter and house syrup absorbed into the coarse texture of the pancakes like water on parched land.  The taste was healthy and filling.  I added more syrup three times during the meal as it continued to disappear.  Yes. It was way sweet enough.  \n\nI couldn't finish the 2 cakes, and wondered how anyone could digest a full stack.  It did sit a little heavy in my stomach for a few hours, but not enough to reach a discomfort level.  I realized later in the day the true meaning of \"Thunder.\"  No need to elaborate.\n\nCross Keys is still a meeting place that takes its cues from the 1980's, right down to the rock music of the era.  The staff is warm and enthusiastic. Definitely worth another round.",

    "text": "Royal Ashoka sits in a small commercial strip along Philmont Avenue in Northeast Philly.  If you are curious, go to their website for descriptions of their broad menu of north and south Indian delights, plus a nice video on top showing colorful veggies being tossed in a frying pan.  \n\nThe house is well appointed with linen and silverware, although the ceiling recessed lighting needs improvement, as it casts shadows at odd angles over the tables. Lower, more subtle sconces would be a big help.  Service is great, and it is apparent management is knee deep in helping out, and takes pride in their efforts.  \n\nOur meal began with Ragada, a chaat variation with Potato Patties, Chickpeas, Yogurt, Mint and Tamarind.  It was delicious and the star of the show.  It was way more than expected, and it was hard to stop eating it to leave room for what was to come.  Gobi Manchurian was a battered and deep fried Cauliflower dish that comes from the mountainous area of North India, near the cultural borders with China.  It was reddish and spicy.  This dish was prepared with a heavy batter that coated the florets like you would find in a General Tso's dish in a Chinese  restaurant.  When I have had this before, there was no such batter, but the veggie was lightly breaded and exposed directly to the chili spice mix, holding a rich burning red and mildly crunchy finish.  The batter approach was not as good as the alternatives elsewhere.\n\nOur last entre was Chicken Amwalla, a Mango Cream sauced Tikka.  This was a first taste of Mango in Indian food for me (other than Mango Lassis), and I liked its creamy fruitiness, and the curry mixed well with it.  The Chili Garlic Naan was great - fresh, hot and jalapeno/garlic richness.  Perfect sponge for sopping up the Amwalla sauce.  \n\nWe were really stuffed by this point, and had decided to take the rest home, when our server approached with complimentary Rice Pudding.  Talk about max overload!  I took a small sample.  It was wonderfully creamy sweet.  They were kind enough to understand that we just couldn't finish it and packed it up with the rest of our leftovers.  \n\nRoyal Asoka is very good.  Remove the drop ceiling and enhance the mood lighting, and it would be a more romantic destination.",

I needed a jolt of Java, and Yelped to find Daily Grind at 48 High.  \n\nIt is a small shop, but appointed as most local cafes are with old plush chairs and a few tables around the room.

About a half dozen regulars lazed in the morning sun pouring through the large storefront windows.  They all knew each other and exchanged small talk. \n\nTo honor the Thanksgiving Spirit, I opted for the special Pumpkin Latte. I hoped for a Cranberry Sauce Capa, but alas, they lacked the ingredients. It was fine; not overpoweringly pumpkined-out. It wasn't cheap at nearly $7, but I was willing to contribute to the success of the local economy in a small way.  There were some good looking muffins under glass on the counter, but I was not in need of the extra carbs. \n\nHigh Street looked really good from my corner stool.

The region, altitude, shade, temperature, water, etc., all contribute to your cup of coffee. Small batch roasters are springing up all over the place to sell directly to the public at retail establishments and cafes, and through chains of distribution to local, regional and national outlets. \n\nThis is a business whose time has come.\n\nEvermore Coffee Roasters on E. Union Street, Burlington, NJ has set up shop on the first floor of an old row house, and done a remarkable job renovating the space into an old century feeling comfortable house, with expresso machine up front, and a larger sitting room in back, with their roaster against the far wall.  Colors are soft gray/blue, and the windows let in a filtered light that provide a warm and dated ambiance commensurate with the age of the building.  Like the feeling here. \n\nMy cup of Congo pour over took a short while to brew, but when I picked it up at the counter, it was hot and steaming.  First sip announced a dark, mysterious roasted bean soup with a kick in the head sensibility. It took no prisoners.  Liked it a lot, even with its strong acidity. At $3.75 for a fairly small self-logoed cup, it was a bit cher for the quantity, but worth the experience. The offer of a refill at a reasonable charge (not to mention gratis), would have enhanced the value proposition. The near-lack of bakery goods or other light fare, had me packing up to move on quickly after finishing my drink.  The opportunity to enjoy any of these options would go a long way to establishing Evermore as a destination for the caf\u00e9 crowd that often likes a little nosh with their bean wash. \n\nStill, an interesting and caffeine-oriented stop on the back streets of Burlington is something to savor.  \n\nStreet parking.

There it was, but at first view it seemed to be behind bars.  Fences and security everywhere.  Reminded of prison gates.  Quickly realized all that parking was for residents, and the street meters were the only nearby option.  At 12 minutes for .25 on a Saturday night, I fished out all my quarters and fed the hungry metal mouth. Then located the narrow opening in the fence and the walkway leading to the resto.  I hoped I had all the necessary credentials to get through customs. \n\nThe boss was squeegeeing his front windows as I walked up to the door.  I was impressed that he had not delegated the work, but took pride in his shop's appearance, knowing that first impressions are so important.  Stepping inside after confirming I had arrived with Ali, I was taken by the crispness of the white linen tablecloths and red napkins.  The space had high industrial ceilings, giving an open sensation.  I was shown to the table and sat down to await the arrival of my friends.  I was alone there at 6 pm; thinking that Indians/Pakistanis prefer late dinners.  I liked the vibe as I perused the menu and took in the details.  \n\nAfter V & M arrived, we ordered several dishes to get a cross section of the kitchen fare.  Samosa Chaat, Chicken Malabar for apps; Salmon Tandoori, Chicken Makhani, Baingan Bharta(Eggplant), a Bread Basket mix, and Basmati Rice as entrees.   Mango Lassi for me, and Sweet Lassi for M.   All were good to excellent. Most memorable were the Chicken Malabar which was grilled and breaded with Coconut, the Samosa Chaat, which had all the ingredients of a Samosa, but reformulated into an open dish full of Potato, Peas, various crunchy chips and spices. Additionally, the Baingan Bharta was very well done with a complementary heat/sweet texture, and the Makhani was tender in a Tomato base curry that was requested hot spiced and delivered fully.  The Salmon Tandoori was the most colorful dish (see photo), but the fish was a tad dry and the veggies and spices so overpoweringly good, that the mild taste of the Salmon was somewhat hidden by its pushy roommates. \n\nAll in all, a very good meal in a pleasant environment.  By the time we left around 8, the room was full, along with our stomachs.  We ended up taking a large portion home with us.  \n\nI will definitely return once they let me out on parole.",

It still is a big box destroyer of family hardware stores, but now that so many of those mom & pop stores are gone, where are we to go for a choice of power tools, ladders, and expandable screws? \n\nI found myself there this weekend as part of a home project to install curtains over a French door.  As all such jobs become, it was more than originally bargained for.  Now, that I had the actual drapes in hand, I discovered that my old electric drill was not in great shape after twenty years, and more importantly, that my handy step stool had been lost in divorce.  \n\nFirst stop - Power Tools.  I felt the rush of adrenaline upon seeing all the sleek steel packaged for a quick date.  Once one of the Home Depot dudes approached to assist, and he explained the difference between NiCad and Lithium batteries, I was the possessor of a new Ryobi power drill/driver, complete with battery pack and charger.  Sexy lime green and black.  \n\nSecond stop - Ladders.  I am tall, but for working at over 7 feet to screw in curtain hardware, I needed help, and my old standby step stool had been purloined in a property settlement deal.  So, I checked a few here, and selected a GorillaLadders three step aluminum and rubber folding stepper for a great price, that I had to admit was much better (and safer) than the old one.  \n\nThird step - Get 'er done!  The Ryobi worked like a dream with variable speeds controlled by my trigger finger, and direction reversal with the push of a button.  I climbed up my new stairs and was able to complete the task with relative ease and speed.  \n\nAmazing what the right tools can accomplish in the hands of a rank and clumsy amateur.",

    "text": "Gotta love The Living Room Caf\u00e9 on South 5th Street! \n\nThis corner breakfast/brunch nook is comfortable in its simplicity.  Expanded into the storefront next door, the dining area offers wooden tables and chairs along two walls and a little sofa and easy chair ensemble up front.  Big table toward the back for larger groups, or, as on the morning we were there, a place for a teacher to tutor her young student.  Wonderful human relations.  Cool back patio in the space between the two buildings. \n\nThe shop is run by Zack, who triples as host, cashier and chef.  He has everything covered with his engaging personality and obvious passion for his enterprise.  He brews the excellent coffee, takes orders, cooks and serves them with equal aplomb.  The impression after a few minutes settling in, is that you are visiting an old friend or first cousin who has welcomed you into his home.  Can't beat it!  \n\nThe menu offers creative takes on American standards, and uses locally sources ingredients to the greatest extent possible.  Too, the names of the dishes pay homage to known personalities in the greater community.  Where to begin?  We opted for the Wake & Bake Burrito and Baked Cinnamon Apple French Toast.  Both were solid choices.  Baked eggs are used rather than fried, making for a drier and healthier meal.  Mixed with house salsa, black beans and sour cream, tightly wrapped and grilled in a tortilla, this breakfast burrito was a tasty substantial morning feast.  \n\nThe French Toast used a light, thick cut slice of (apple?) bread, with Chinese flat bottomed spoons full of walnuts and shredded coconut, and a small pitcher of maple syrup, to apply as you see fit.  Very good idea, but for my full enjoyment, the bread itself lacked the coarse texture I prefer, as well as the caramelization that occurs when egg, sugar and hot iron meet on the grill, that crisps up the edges for added flavor and crunch (Perhaps, because frying on the grill is not their thing?). \n\nRegardless, The Living Room Caf\u00e9 is a cozy home to hang out in while eating your early day meal.  Def worth a visit or three.",

    "text": "Tony Luke's on Oregon Avenue close by the Sports Complex is as \"Philly\" as Philly gets. \n\nTucked in under the concrete and steel of elevated Rt. 95, it feels like a Lilliputian railroad car of a restaurant in the uber scale of its environment.  In winter the heavy plastic and aluminum walls are attached to keep the patrons warm.  I had the feeling of being in an ant farm next to the glass wall.  None of which detracted from my first time enjoyment of this iconic cheesesteak emporium. \n\nFamished after skipping regular dinner to attend a way-to-long business meeting at a local hotel, I would have eaten just about anything.  Lucky for me, my pal suggested Tony Luke's.  We were there in minutes and I drove into the small parking lot next door.  The aroma of fresh (and stale) grease flooded my senses, squeezing my salivary glands, much like a vampire prepared for the first bite knowing it will bring strength and relief.  My mouth involuntarily hung open with jaws ready to clamp down on a great steak sandwich.  Melodies of Rocky Balboa rang in my head.  \n\nI had the Italian Special Steak with Saut\u00e9ed Spinach.  It reached the take out window about 10 minutes later, tightly rolled up in white paper with Tony Luke's logo emblazoned across it.  We sat at one of the red tables, slit the tape and unwound the packaging.  First glance was of a long Italian torpedo roll, held shut by the former pressure, now free to open and display its steamy contents.  The brown of the steak; the dark green of the olive oil induced heavily garliced Spinach; the melted ooze of the Provolone - all combined to create an exquisite moment of anticipation.  \n\nThe first chomp took in as much of the tip of the sandwich as my mouth could hold.  Garghhhh...womp.....grind....chew....swallow....Repeat. The bread was crusty and fresh, belying the following softness of the steak, cheese and spinach.  Texturally perfect! The sequence of the unfolding parts only overtaken by the totality of the whole.  Truly existential. \n\nIt was great, but to be completely honest, the Spinach was over salted with the garlic, and was too dominant a flavor on my palate.  Everything else was awesome, and the Birch Beer a smooth compensation for the sodium chloride load.  \n\nThis is a Def place to return.  The overall gestalt is wonderfully and uniquely Philadelphia urban chic, as cool today as it was decades before.",

    "text": "Located in a nicely refurbished shop that previously had been a Chinese restaurant, Yardley Bagel Cafe in the Makefield Shopping Center, is a welcome addition to the area (Yardley is a more toney address, thus the name).  A corner space with windows on two sides, it is a comfortable place to bagel up with decent java and settle into a booth with friends or on a metal stool along a wooden shelf anchored to an exposed brick wall to do your daily reading. They really did a very good job creating a welcoming environment. \n\nYBC does most everything bagel, with many choices of cream cheese, smoothies and sandwiches to match the multiple choice of well appointed rounders. A look at the bagel bins shows that these folks take pride in their product. They are plump and loaded with toppings so much so that the actual top crust cannot be seen beneath. The generosity is appreciated. The prices are competitive, and perhaps lower than the other bagels outlets in the area. My onion bagel, butter and swiss, with cuppa joe brought me change from my fiver. \n\nMy breakfast looked great with the layers exposed in cross section and little onion bits falling onto the plate with each lift and bite. While I prefer a crustier skin offset by a light and airy center, rather than the mono-textural bread presented here, the onion flakes were like savory poprocks that compensated a bit for that shortcoming. \n\nYardley Bagel Cafe won't replace Bagel Train (really in Yardley) for my favorite bagel in the area, but it is a cool place when hanging out is part of the experience. \n\nExcellent job!",

    "text": "Peter Pan Diner is long gone.  Nottingham Diner lasted for about six weeks. The most recent incarnation at this old kitchen locale opened about a month ago as the White Horse Diner.  After dropping off a client at home apres court I decided to drop in for a late lunch and to see how the old gal looked.  \n\nThis is one of the smaller Jersey diners, with a short counter of about six spinners, booths along the front wall, and a small dining room around the side.  Enough parking out back.  It looked like the new owners spent some shekels cleaning up the place.  Everything was spanking bright.  My server, Larissa, was, too.  \n\nThere was plenty on the menu, but as a first timer, I went with the \"Lunch Specials\" list.  All the options were $6.99 with soup/salad, fries and a pickle.  At that price, they were cutting their margins to the bone.  I opted for their California Burger.  \n\nIt arrived on a large platter.  The burger was housed in a shiny-topped egg bread roll, and a large slice of tomato, red onion and wad of iceberg under the hood.  The beef seemed fresh and came out hot. A shot of ketchup, and I was in business.  It held together very well under my onslaught.  Little escaped as I clamped down again and again with gizunta bites like a dinosauric carnivore. It all came together smashingly well.  \n\nWhile I didn't mistake this burger for fine dining, it was solid and enjoyable.  The fries were hot and crisp. The coleslaw, coleslaw. \n\nThat was more than enough to make me a happy fan.\n\nThinking about bringing the family for Thanksgiving dinner.",

    "text": "First & Ten Sports Pub doesn't look like much driving by this southwestern-looking one story brick house on Hamilton Avenue.  Aside from remembering that this joint has been a bar in many different disguises for years, I would not have bothered to slow down to catch the name on the sign out front.  \n\nBut, I did, and looked it up on Yelp to see what the story was.  Reviews were mostly positive, with highlights on their wings and other bar food, while somewhat less than enthusiastic about the beer selection, despite being called a \"Pub.\"  Walls with HDTVs for sports watching were also a clear part of the description.  What the hey?!  It looked worthy of a lunch drop in, so I found myself in their ill-maintained parking lot on a hot sunny sultry Wednesday afternoon.  It was dark inside despite several windows, and it took a few seconds for my eyes to adjust.  \n\nI saw a pretty large \"U\"-shaped bar, with room for near 20 barstools, two well stations for mixing drinks, and a beer pour stand with at least 10 handles.  From the look of them most were domestic labels, but a few made it across borders north and south.  Lots of HiDef screens up high tuned into the Olympics or local sports.  The walls were rough hewn pine panels, and the ceiling exposed painted beams with beer logos hanging from them.  This was, indeed, a dive bar dressed up for a sports crowd.  Nothing wrong with that at all.  In fact, it was pretty nice in a dingy beer drinking afternoon sort of way.  That was surely the intention of the half dozen other dudes who were trying to keep out of the sun.  Full sized pool table in the back looked like it had a few stories it could tell.  The bartender was working alone and seemed to know everyone, but me.  She approached to inquire, and brought my drink and menu with pace.  \n\nNot in the mood for wings & brew when I knew I had to return to the office, I opted for their Thin Crust Tomato, Mozza and Basil Pie Special @ $6.50.  I do love a good bar pie when the chef knows what she's doing.  It came out about 10 minutes later, and it was a beauty. Cracker thin crust. Slightly sweet sauce with fresh strips of Basil spread around atop the melted Mozza cheese, and sweet Cherry Tomatoes cut in half lengthwise spread strategically across the entire surface.  Very attractive.\n\nHow was the pie?  While not at the level of Jo Jo's, Ivy Tavern, nor Pete's, it was still a solid wheel with plenty of flavor and excellent crust.  I would not hesitate to have another along with a basket of Garlic Wings on my next visit.  Sufficient beer choices to keep me happy, although this is not a beer lovers paradise.\n\nPRO TIP - Be careful driving around the building so as not to cause tire or alignment issues.  The back lot needs help.",

    "text": "Surprising good Chinese cuisine at this basement kitchen associated with the Asia Market on North 11th Street, Chinatown, Philadelphia. There may have been change of ownership and this is a first visit, but if the past owners were even better on the wok than these folks, then I missed something pretty special, because I was quite happy with what we ate this night. \n\nAmazingly convenient if grocery shopping of Chinese ingredients is your reason for being there in the first place. Just go hungry, eat, and then shop.  Worked well for us. It is not too far fetched to think that if the Tasty kitchen runs out of something, they just walk a few feet into the supermarket and pick up what they needed. Symbiotic. \n\nWe ordered the wonton soup, salt baked squid and roast pork on rice. All were very good to excellent, despite the somewhat dank surroundings. The large bowl of soup was loaded with more than a dozen freshly handmade wontons with ground pork filling.  The beef consume was hot with a pleasant flavor.  Made for fun slurping. The squid was cut into fairly large pieces and coated with a light flour, salt and pepper breading.  It was tender and juicy. Especially enjoyed the scallion and sliced jalapenos the dish was mixed with.  The flavor/texture profile became quite animated on the palate. This was the star of the show.  The roast pork had a nice ruddy bark and was lean cut.  Not quite Ting Wong Restaurant level, but close enough. We ended up taking about half of the dry dishes home.  \n\nWith all the wonderful alternatives on the street above, there is not that much reason to go subterranean for a solid meal, unless price motivates you highly. The numbers on the menu were very reasonable, and it is easy to imagine that Tasty Place does a large business with students and others on a budget.  \n\nYou certainly get more than you paid for here.",

Three story open barroom where once horse drawn firewagons were housed, with upper floor sleeping room for those once on duty and a rear space full of stainless steel distilling tanks and vats. Fascinating place I wish I had time to explore with a knowledgeable guide.\n\nMaybe next time, but tonight we were there for a political fundraiser for a local county official seeking reelection. Judging by his choice of party venue, the open bar and the look of everyone present to support him and wish him success, he has a strong chance of re-election. Even the local congressman was there to wish him well.\n\nWith speeches and a good buffet (and that open bar) there was opportunity for limited sipping and light dining in the midst of the very loud din of conversation  between the soapboxing. The distillery itself remained background to an excellent soiree. \n\nWill definitely return for more tasting and a tour.",

In my recent experience, the proliferation of DDs has diluted the quality and consistency of the signature products, so that the coffee is often harsh and undrinkable in some shops, and still quite good in others.  Same thing for donuts. Some have good ones. Some don't.  As everyone is trained the same way, it comes down to water quality and cultural familiarity with sweet rounders.\n\nThis joint was pretty good.  There was a small communications problem, but what I ultimately received (breakfast sandwich and joltin' joe) were both hot and tasty.  \n\nNo complaints.

    "text": "Salute Ristorante is another in the new and tasty options in the renaissance of Morrisville, Pa. \nIt sits on West Trenton Avenue, where Centre Fruit used to be and next to the venerable dive Morrisville Tavern.  Don't let the neighborhood deter you, because Salute is a very good Italian shop, with dark modern tones, and interesting menu.  I stopped in for lunch today after having it on my Bookmark list for about a year.  \n\nThis is not a pizzeria by any stretch, in fact the only way you get a tomato pie is when it is offered as a special.  This place is all about a creative kitchen that spins out fresh and well considered dishes with panache. It is pricey for Morrisville, but the quality of the offerings made me forget that I was still in this struggling river town.  If they can do that, they are indeed, approaching magical.  \n\nLunch included a small bowl of soup, and I chose the 16 Bean alternative.  It was a solid performer, although I confess to not counting the beans. They were well cooked and soft enough to show they were simmered a long time.  The elbow macaroni in the mix contributed to the interesting textures.  I could easily imagine a soup and salad return visit. \n\nMy eggplant parmesan sandwich became a platter upon request.  Didn't want all that bread, and my table had a large half loaf delivered up front with my water.  I was more than happy with a couple of its large sesame slices and a swipe of cool butter.  The plate was beautifully presented.  The chunky red sauce and white mozzarella covered the unbreaded thin slices of nightshade like an abstract painting framed by the square white ceramic.  Heavy silver toned utensils made short work of the cutting and lifting.  The taste was very nice, with the homemade sauce providing moral support to the veggie and cheese.  It might have been a tad salty, but not enough to detract from the pleasure of eating. \n\nSalute is a worthy addition to the growing (still nascent) restaurant scene in Morrisville.  I raise a glass of Sangiovese to your good fortune.",

    "text": "Ila Mae's Restaurant sits right off the intersection of Broad and Market in the heart of Trenton. Parking is next to impossible in this neighborhood, so be prepared to walk a few blocks if you want to chow down in a relatively undiscovered gem.  \n\nI stopped in on a cold, icy morning in February.  There were only a few people there and I settled in in the front dining room in front of the large HDTV sitting high on the opposite wall.  The furnishings were Spartan, but the space was clean and inviting. My server, David, handed me the large menu and I decided to have breakfast as it was still being offered.  \n\nI asked about their French Toast and their Breakfast Sandwiches.  David smiled.  He alerted me to the presence of their French Toast Sandwich - Short Stack with 2 Eggs and Beef or Turkey Sausage inside the well grilled bread.  No pork products here.  The meal arrived in about 15 minutes, and I realized that each meal was prepared separately by the chef/owner.  The two people ahead of me were served individually, and then mine was put together.  No problem. I was not in a rush to return to the inclement weather. \n\nThe French Toast was good on its own, but when combined with the spicy Beef Sausage and Scrambled Eggs it took on another identity which was tasty and fun to eat. The extra small pitcher of syrup came in handy to pour over the sausage when I opened the top of the creation.  Its strong flavor was nicely offset by the sweetness.  A sprinkle of black pepper on the eggs completed the effort.  \n\nThis was a very good breakfast from atmosphere, through bottomless coffee mug, and everything in between.  Their lunch and dinner menu looks very interesting, and I hope to return to explore it in the near future.",

    "text": "The approach to Concerto Fusion takes you past a 60's era Dairy Queen, over old railroad tracks laid down when Fairless Works smelted steel by the megaton, and if you drive across the Delaware River from Trenton, on the girders of the famous \"Trenton Makes\" Bridge.  Quite a history lesson. \n\nThen, you pull into the parking lot for Concerto and behold the fa\u00e7ade of the side-facing entrance, all bright orange and red lanterns - like a cross between Miami Beach Ocean Drive and Lantern Festival in Xiamen. Pleasantly disconcerting cultural mix.  And, perhaps, that was the intention of the owners of this Asian fusion establishment, so neatly tucked away in a dark corner of Morrisville.  Get you slightly off-centered as you approach and enter their well appointed den, and prepare you for an experience both gastronomically and architecturally that is also designed to unbalance you.  \n\nThe room is spacious with curved walls, flowing koi pond, mirrors and raised dining area.  The small bar sits in the middle of the room, almost invisible, yet with a half dozen stools for those who prefer cold liquid fusion.  Similarly, the sushi area is in a corner behind the entrance and bar wall, where a solitary chef moves silently and efficiently cutting, molding, wrapping and presenting his artistry.  \n\nWe sat at a corner table closest to the sushi works and the kitchen, near enough to see what was going on, but not be a distraction.  The ambiance was of quiet confidence and appealing tones.  There was no doubt that a lot of thought had gone into the layout, and that the vision was carried out exceptionally well.  Even several years of operation and breaking in, while noticeable, had not detracted from the effect.   \n\nSo, how was the food?  Glad you asked. \n\nWe appetized with the Hawaiian Tropical Roll (Eel, Avocado, Tobiko, Soy Wrap, lightly crusted Tempura and pleasing secret sauce). It arrived slightly warm with a mild crunch, and was a very enjoyable opening gambit.  Wasabi, Ginger and Soy discretely on the side of the plate. I would have preferred the naturally white ginger to the pink colored alternative, but that is a very small minus. \n\nFrom there we selected from the Thai offerings: Pad Thai with Chicken and Pineapple Curry Fried Rice with Shrimp.  Both arrived on large round white plates in amounts beyond our capacities to consume.  They were good and satisfying, if not the best of breed that can be found in ethnic restos specializing in this cuisine. Nonetheless, we were happy to bring home the rest for another meal.  Most pleasingly, both had large quantities of nuts; whole cashews for the rice, and ground peanuts for the noodles, and plenty of shrimp and chicken, respectively. \n\nService was provided by our waiter who also was bartender this evening.  He kept busy, and was not the most engaging sort.  He seemed a bit ill at ease interacting with us.  No biggie.  Forgivable. \n\nThe only annoyance was the charge for hot tea.  Yes, quality tea is more expensive that the orange pekoe take out variety, but at $2.50 per green tea bag and a pot of hot water, it is off-putting.  That generates more profit than the bar. Makes it worthwhile to plan ahead and bring your own tea. Check. Your move. \n\nOverall, while not the best sushi and Thai dishes in the world, everything we had was enjoyable.  The design elements within and without made it unusual and had the desired impact of slightly altering perception to be a unique environment much farther away from daily reality than a drive into Morrisville would suggest.",

While the Bucks foliage had not peaked, Down to Earth certainly had. We walked in to a large room with heavily eurothaned wood slab tables, mix and match coffee mugs and huge blackboard with the daily specials. The shop wasn't crowded and we found a table across from the cashier, where orders are taken and paid for before pouring the coffee and settling in. \n\nThe first sip of the Speakeasy Roaster House Blend signaled we were in for something great. This Montgomery County company turns out amazing beans. I found myself working it over my tongue to identity it's subtleties like I would a glass of wine.\n\nSuperb!

Really liked it. The Pork Roll and Cheese on Kaiser was solid, but nothing exceptional. \n\nService is personable, if slow. The delivery of the meals is a bit disorganized. The workers behind the counter seem to lose sight of the seated customers and are unaware of their needs. This is sometimes a problem with semi self serve plans. \n\nStill, a superior breakfast and top notch java make Down to Earth Cafe a real find.\n\nAntiques, smoothies and coffee mug club add to the feel of wholesome community displayed here.",

They don't know from brunch, and they close before happy hour; so don't bookmark it for your weekend morning meal, nor try to stop in after work.  This is a 7 to 3:30 corner grill that had a few dozen thick scrapple slices frying to a dark brown while I drank their Ellis Coffee and awaited my first taste of their french toast.  \n\nThe house has about a dozen tables in two rooms and eight spinning stools along the counter that overlooks the chef workspace.  It was about half full of neighborhood personalities who seemed to know each other as they were greeted by name.  The server, a lovely young woman who is Kitty's niece, took care of me, and filled me in on the history of the institution, open since 1952! \n\nYes. It looks its age, with family photos on the walls, and original floors, walls and stools.  Either you get the deeply rubbed in culture here, or you don't. With its gritty charm and surprisingly good food, it is easy to develop a crush on Kitty, and want to visit her often. She is as authentic as the day is long.  My three slices of thick egged toast were very good.  A little sweet from the vanilla and sugar in the mix, and a little crispy on the edges where the hot steel melted that sugar and left its hardened residue.  They know how to do FT here. $5.50 was a happy price. The java was strong and a little rough (bitter), but nothing to complain about. Again, her Joe is straight up Bunn-O-Matic.  No expresso options with Kitty. \n\nKitty's is very close to I-95, and an easy on/off if you want to stop before reaching Center City from the north. Not sure she could handle becoming a hit on the breakfast bookmark circuit, especially on weekends, so if you want to check her out, come on a weekday morning when the regular crowd is thinner.  \n\nBut, if you like hard stop traditional breakfast without any frills, give this old girl a go.",

It is bigger than most I have visited, with ten private rooms, each well appointed and very clean.  \n\nTheir staff is well trained in traditional Chinese technique, plus Swedish and a little Shiatsu.  Lily, my masseuse, asked if I would like her to work deep tissue and walk on my back.  No problem.  She went from my shoulders to the soles of my feet like a dancer.  Very effective. With practically every step I felt/heard a snap, crackle and pop as she stretched me out. \n\nHot stones and steam towels alternated where I had the most discomfort, followed by her forearm and elbows probing the facets and pushing apart the disks in my spinal column.  \n\nIt was an excellent, relaxing and therapeutic massage. I think I even fell asleep. At a buck a minute, it was a fair price.  After shoveling snow and feeling the sciatic stress, it was great to feel such prompt relief.  \n\nIf they had a sauna or two, served fruit and hot tea, it would be just about perfect.",

Additionally, they have a large banquet hall available for rental to outside organizations.  It was in this capacity that I attended the Jefferson Dinner sponsored by the Bucks County Democratic Committee earlier this week.  The hall was spacious with high ceilings and chandeliers.  The food presented in buffet style was better than average for a mass feeding of about 300 people.  We are not talking haute cuisine, but solid Italian American fare with Chicken Francaise, Baked Ham, Roast Beef options, as well as tasty Pasta and nice Caesar Salad.  I ate well after listening to a few too many speeches from candidates in the up coming election. As this is not a political site, no need to discuss who and what was said.  \n\nIf I had to organize a large event including dinner, drinks, dancing, and speaking in the Lower Bucks, Philadelphia region, I would certainly consider Lodge 5 as a good locale and forum.  I was very satisfied with the over ambiance of the place, as well as the food. \n\n Too, when tired of the windbags, you can slip into the large lounge and take a seat at the long bar for a quick round or two, surrounded by Philly's Finest.  Nice to have a drink feeling secure. \n\n Feel free to buy a round for the men and women in blue, and thank them for everything they do for us to keep us safe.",

The operation in Bensalem, PA, on Street Road doesn't look like much on the outside located in a rather forlorn strip center, but once inside the vast array of produce, frozen and dry goods is fairly amazing. \n\nFor a first visit we were pleasantly surprised at the quantity and quality of the fresh produce.  We found it to be better priced than our regular supermarkets and very competitive with our local farmers' market.  We ended up stocking up on some very interesting south Asian veggies, especially hot peppers. Additionally, we picked up a few frozen items (garlic naan, veggie samosas) just to check them out, and some henna for natural hair color applications.  On our way out we marveled at the low cost of the five bags we hauled out of there. \n\nThe aisles were very well stocked, and it was possible to buy rice and flour in bulk.  There were many customers on Sunday morning and it was a bit crowded moving through the store, but this presented the opportunity to talk to some folks about their experience at Patel Brothers, as well as their recommendations for what to purchase.  Very useful.  Staff was ever present and helpful in finding what we sought. \n\nThis was a first visit to Patel Brothers and exposure to all the amazing possibilities present in a good Indian grocery.  Many return visits are likely.",

Need fresh fish for your father-in-law?

That's just the way it is.  Sell by dates important to you?  It may be better to just close your eyes. \n\nStaff is very helpful and multilingual.

A coat of paint hides a multitude of sins. But, if you don't look too closely at the condition of the store, and just focus on the food that comes from behind the counter, you can almost imagine that you are in a cool old joint that really creates some first rate sandwiches for breakfast and lunch.  Management is very friendly and accommodating, and have time to chat and joke while they work.  The four or five tables make eating on site easy. Otherwise, takeout is the name of the game.\n\nMy homemade chicken salad sandwich on fresh rye bread was a strong contender for Lunch of the Week.  Moist, mayoed just enough. Piled with shredded lettuce and slices of tomato. My teeth cleaved through it, feeling each layer expose its secrets. Not an ounce of fat nor cartilage to be found. Along with the Calypso Southern Peach Lemonade, it was a very enjoyable and inexpensive lunch. Came in under $8, and I easily could have wrapped up half the Sammy for another snack.  \n\nOlden Avenue Deli also does breakfast.  I will be checking that out soon enough, but as sandwich places go, it should be on your list.  Just don't spend too much time looking behind the counter or at the outside trim, which definitely need work.",

But, what about the quality of the meats and sides offered in the kitchen? \n\nFrom my point of view the ribs, brisket, sausage, chicken and the savory sides, are all good to very good, but as with most outlets in the northeast, not nearly as excellent as available in the American South and Southwest. We seem to lack the cultural history that creates the awesome smoked meats and heavily flavorful sauces found in every back road smokehouse from Virginia to Florida and Georgia to Texas. Still, Mission is not a bad substitute when time for a road trip is lacking. \n\nI enjoyed the Baby Backs I sucked off the bone last weekend. The meat was tender, even if lacking crusty bark, smoke rings and thick, luscious sauces that are the true sign of authenticity. The Texas Twang and Tupelo Honey Heat were too thin to hold fast to the ribs, but remained at the bottom of the tray available for repeated dipping. My side choices of BBQ Beans and Cole Slaw were alright and completed the meal nicely. The corn bread was a small thin square, and somewhat dry, but sweet enough to remind me of what the real thing tasted like. \n\nSo, until I have time to visit my sister in Newport News, my former bro-lo in Charlotte or friends in Austin, Mission will have to do. The folks there are friendly enough to make it a positive experience.",

That they certainly do very well. \n\nIt begins with the deep Asian d\u00e9cor of the dining room. Although simple, it has Shoji screens on the walls, and black & white photographs spread around that add to the cultural flavor.  It is a calming space, but for the out of place loud contempo western music blasting from the high speakers. How much better it would be with soft flute, strings and bells, to go with the Jasmine tea and delectable menu. \n\nI ordered Basil Thai Noodles with chicken, at a 3/5 heat level. It arrived looking great on the white ceramic plate. The taste was excellent with plenty of Thai basil, peppers, onion, sprouts and chicken in addition to the broad noodles that offered plenty of surface area to hold the rich sauce. While I learned that the third heat level was more a one to my tongue, that did not detract from the wonderful taste. Really liked it a lot. I am sure they would have provided chili sauce if requested. \n\nIt was great to find another southeast Asian kitchen had arrived in southern Bucks County. It joins the rare few other pioneers who have staked a claim to broadening our cultural and culinary horizons. I will return for much more.  \n\nCongratulations on your recent launch, and great fortune in the future!",

It seemed busy for 3:00 on a Thursday afternoon, perhaps due to this special deal, or maybe they are always so popular. Plenty of nametagged staff working their takeout food operation, and others scurrying to keep everything stocked for customers. \n\nThe Cuban java was quite good, although somehow the Tanzanian African dispenser was empty despite all the attention being paid to this gratis offer. Too, their donut display was loaded and advertising a 6 for $3 bargain (I couldn't resist). \n\nThe store was clean and I was in and out in under 10 minutes. Parking was a breeze and the access through the side streets rather than the main street helped keep traffic moving smoothly and safely. \n\nThese Super Wawas are onto something. Providing a small discount on gasoline and standardized sandwiches, soups, snacks, drinks and solid coffee, in an attractive environment that keeps everyone moving quickly, is a great idea whose time has comes. Taking them off the turnpike and into the community is clearly better than just the convenience stores we have in most places now. The only thing we should worry about is the natural business inclination to demand too much of a good thing, thus creating a glut of copycat roadside service centers in the wrong places that compete for the same dollars. \n\nI wouldn't mind having one near by, but not right next door.",

I found it decorated with colorful tables and carved back wood chairs depicting the beauty of the traditional town square with church steeples, red tile roofs and flowering bourganvillas. The Muzac was a bit too loud for dining, but surely the staff enjoyed it throughout the day.\n\nMy lunch of their tacos dorado (golden fried tacos) was very interesting and tasty. Stuffed within the rolled \"flutes\" were mashed potatoes, grilled chicken, and cheese. The softness just behind the crunch was fun and unexpected. On top was the mix of lettuce, tomato and fresh crema found on every plate. The red salsa in the table rocket liberally applied brought it all together. Liked it alot. \n\nIt was fairly priced @ $8.50, and filling enough to skip dinner tonight. \n\nNorristown has many Latin American restaurants to choose from. El Limon (The Lemon) is worthy of consideration for your pesos.",

    "text": "Prince Fried Chicken protrudes from the 500 block of Hamilton Avenue, Trenton, NJ, due to the construction of a second story sunroom in front of the original small store.  While it likely does not satisfy the requirement of the ADA because of the steps needed to enter the shop, those who are able to climb will find the ascent well worthwhile.  \n\nClearly, these dudes have thought about what people want to buy when they look for American fried chicken.  Boxes and buckets for sure.  Sandwiches, tenders and nuggets more than likely. Hamburgers for the chicken averse. Salads for the health conscious. Sweet desserts for absolutely everyone.  They have all this, and even more. Most importantly, they seem to do all of it quite well in their tiny space.  \n\nThis is primarily a take out joint, with only a couple of stools along a shelf on one wall, so I knew that I would be eating at my desk.  That requires consideration of the grease and mess factor with all the paper in my work area. So, I ordered a fried chicken sandwich, rather than a box of chicken and sundries, and a single wing to discover the essence of the operation.  What I found was quite encouraging.  The sandwich contents were a plump, never frozen chicken breast, breaded lightly with a spicy flour coating that turned a golden brown with coaxing from the deep fryer.  A smear of mayo and a leaf of lettuce inside a soft sesame seed topped roll completed this simple creation.  First bite (always so important) reported the juicy freshness of the bird, as well as the interesting mildly hot jacket it was dressed in.  It was very good.  If only the roll had been stronger and able to hold up better, it would been remarkable. Still, I would definitely go back for more.\n\nThe wing, bagged expertly in a long narrow wax paper sleeve, was likewise tasty and properly cooked to its optimal moment.  It was easily pulled apart, and the meat removed by teeth and tongue.  Same spicy flavor.  If anything, I liked it more than the sandwich.  \n\nConclusion: Prince Fried Chicken is really good.  A bucket for the family, along with a sampling of the large cookies, brownies and cheesecake, are in the offing for the near future.  Otherwise, I will just have to clear my desk before bringing in a box for my luncheon pleasure.",

In those days not every battle was in an open field, or behind trees or stone walls, but in the hearts of patriots and loyalists. It was in this very tavern that the debates about liberty and fidelity to the crown were argued, people took sides and made decisions that would effect their lives and the course of history. If you belly up to the bar today you may hear similar talk about status quo and change voiced with the same ferocity. It is good that some things never change much. The issues are as important today in their own way.\n\nIf you don't come for the history, be sure to come for the grub. It is very good. The kitchen knows what to do with meat. They have a smoker out back and a grill in house that does a job on brisket, prime rib, babybacks and steak that will satisfy the savage carnivore within. Our prime rib and brisket sandwiches were a load and a half of perfectly smoked and slathered beef, pretending to fit on a Kaiser roll. Each was enough for two meals. My side of baked beans came in a nice size dish that was about the best I'd ever tasted. Zangin' and twangin'! \n\nYou wouldn't think of Gardenville as a custom beer joint or martini bar, but they have enough choice to keep you satisfied. Between an IPA and citrus shandy, we were happy campers. The bar food is mostly fried, but there are plenty of quality options deeper in the menu and specials. Service is a pleasure with black and whites who enjoy their jobs. \n\nWhether you live nearby or have to drive for a while, Gardenville Hotel is a worthwhile trip back in time.",

It is an impressive and attractive house, with lots of stone and wood in a large room. It even has a three sided wall fireplace in the lobby, a large bar on the left, plenty of booths and tables, and al fresco dining under the extended overhang in front. \n\nI was there for a business lunch this week without a reservation. No problem. At 1:00 pm we had a booth in under ten minutes. Service was bright and friendly, and it was obvious the staff was well school in the details of the menu.  First glance showed that prices were upscale, but so were the dishes described in the large format menu. With a little work it was easy to find a light healthy veggie lunch in the appetizer list and avoid the high end dishes farther in. For around $10 I enjoyed the hummus plate that included grapefruit slices, fresh dark green sweetpeas, scoop slices of carrot and zucchini, and triangles of warm pita. Very good. My associate ordered a quinoa type sandwich and side salad. She said it was also highly satisfying. \n\nAll in all, Harvest Grill is a new level of farm to table cuisine that brings up the standard for quality dishes in the community. There is a price to pay for it, but judging by the crowded midweek dining room, it is a price people are more than happy to absorb. \n\nSuch success does not come without some adjustments to the customary dining outlets in Newtown. They all have to step up their games to stay relevant in the local resto wars, or risk being left behind. On the other hand, the surge in new kitchens appearing in this quarter create serious parking problems that at some point may literally drive customers away as they tire of hunting for a spot to leave their wheels for a chance at a great meal. \n\nFor now, that is a good problem to have.",

I love DeLorenzo's tomato pies, and have been amazed by them since moving to Trenton many years ago and discovering the Italian wonders of the Chambersburg neighborhood. I, like most of those fabulous Roman kitchens, have since left the city for greener lawns in the suburbs, but still returned to Hudson Street, and Robbinsville thereafter, just to continue our love affair with their thin crust tomato pies, that were the best I had ever eaten until that time.\n\nThey have since expanded into Bucks County, with their newest venture on Edgewood Road in Lower Makefield, PA. (No, it is not Yardley).  I couldn't wait to have the opportunity to visit their new digs. That finally happened yesterday on a Sunday evening. I had ordered by phone a few hours before to be certain they could handle my request given how busy their joint normally was on weekends. I was assured that my two large pies (one regular and one sausage) could be handled by the designated pick up time of 7:00 PM.  \n\nWhen I arrived, the smallish parking lot was overflowing, but I lucked into someone pulling out just as I pulled in.  Their store is all new construction alongside the Giant Shopping Center off Stony Hill Road. As expected, the waiting area was jammed with people waiting for tables.  I approached the very busy cashier, and when he had a second to look at me, gave him my name for the takeout order. He checked in the kitchen and relayed that my pies were not yet out of the oven.\n\nPerfect! I would secure them at apex heat and transport them home while still baking inside.  I reflexively began to salivate at the thought of biting into the steaming chunky red gravy, mozzarella and thin cracker crust. Oh, Yeah!\n\nThe ten minute wait was fine with me. I used the time to take photos and watch all the happy customers. The aroma was timeless, and threw me into reveries of my earliest experience with DeLo's grand pies. I eventually paid the $35 for the two artisanal works of edible art, and drove home with visions of plum tomatoes and basil dancing in my head. \n\nThe sausage pie was just as amazing as I remembered. Local crumbled meat, fresh melted mozza, and mildly salty thin crust to complement the equally mildly sweet red sauce. The explosion in my mouth was a wonderful party with old friends. Unfortunately, the regular pie was overbaked, with too much crust burn and too little sauce filling the irregularly shaped base. I like some scorching as much as anyone, but this one was beyond that - complete carbon in too many places. This can happen when the kitchen staff is stretched to the max and doesn't watch each pie through the process. Chalk it up to a bad card in an otherwise sound hand. \n\nDeLorenzo's is still about the best tomato pie in the area, especially on this side of the Delaware River.  Very glad to save the longish drive to Robbinsville, NJ,  although their cousin's shop in Levittown is just as good.",

It was really too loaded to just pick up by hand and stuff into mouth.  Knife and fork were needed to get everything into my mouth collectively.  The accompanying Crinkle Cut Fries were also above average.\n\nMy most pleasant surprise was ordering the Jugo de Melon drink.  This was the water added version of a milk shake made from Watermelon, and it came served in the aluminum blender container.  It was totally refreshing. \n\nMy Spanish was just adequate for a few short conversations about the restaurant, and to permit me to compliment them on a terrific little joint.  The owner and his family came out to eat while I was there, and I made it clear the food was delicioso, and that I would revuelve pronto.",

    "text": "Very nice set up for this latest addition to the El Limon franchise in Bucks County. Radcliffe Street was already a great riverside lane in Bristol, but is even better with the presence of the small dining room (8 tables/booths) and cool outdoor curbside seating of this Mexican house. Definitely perfect for a still warm late September autumn night. \n\nReally liked the Tacos Dorados with the combination of shredded chicken, mashed potato and spices, deep fried and topped with lettuce, tomato and queso blanco, and choice of red/green salsa from table rockets. Firm crunch, followed by smooth chew and blended flavors. Yet, @ 3 for $9., it seemed overpriced, as was the tempting and delicious Tres Leches dessert @$5.95. Good taste and texture, but I won't be that indulgent next time. The Horchata drink was cool and refreshing with the taste of vanilla and fresh cinnamon right down to the final suck through plastic straw.\n\nMaybe I need to accept the pandemic inflation of late, but I still have optimism that prices will come down once the supply chain amps up and evens out. For now I appreciate the chance to get out and enjoy a meal beyond my own kitchen.",

    "text": "Four Seasons Diner on Cottman Avenue, Northeast Philadelphia, is a traditional highway roadhouse in the semi-urban jungle that is this part of the great city. It is well maintained, with plenty of parking, classic lunch counter in back, and booths galore all around. They also have a lot of recessed colored lighting in the ceiling, which gives a somewhat funhouse quality to it all. \n\nI stepped to the rear and was the only customer on a spinner. The menu is enormous for the morning meal, so it took a few minutes to go through it. In the meantime, I received my mugga joe and a side glass of milk, as requested. Ultimately, I went with their french toast and bacon combo for $7.95. Only these old joints that have paid off their construction loans can afford to offer such inexpensive vittles. Wish they also offered real maple syrup rather than the pre-packaged sweeteners. Still, with three large slices of bread and an equal number of well done bacon, I felt satiated without even touching the third slice of toast. \n\nAll the while, I had plenty of attention from the staff, who filled my mug repeatedly, and asked after my satisfaction. Had I been more gregarious, I no doubt would have had strong conversation with the ladies all morning. I preferred to stick to my reading. \n\nThis part of Philly has many diners to chose from. Glad I chose a decent one for today's brekkie. I passed several others on my way to the office, and will check them out in due course.",

    "text": "When another Chinese house was closed on Tuesday in Hatboro, we pulled out the trustee Yelp App and found Wing Lee Cuisine not far away in Horsham on Easton Road.  As the saying goes; \"One door closes and another opens.\"  So it was last evening. We may never know what we were missing, because there is little chance we will return to Hatboro from Newtown for dinner, but we definitely discovered a very good Chinese restaurant about a mile away that is open seven days a week and serves good quality dishes with friendly service from ownership.  \n\nThe room was well appointed, clean and attractive with white linen and heavy metal utensils in addition to available chopsticks.  We brought our own libations and were promptly given a table side ice bucket to hold the beer at arms length.  The menu was Chinese in front, and Japanese in back.  There were plenty of options from Cantonese, to Hunanese, to Szechuanese (although this was a light version of the kickin' spiciness we desired; lacking any Szechuan chili peppers or star peppercorns), and a page of fish platters. Regardless of that small disappointment, everything was well made with fresh ingredients, superior sauces, and nice presentations.  \n\nWe asked for Hunanese Lamb, which was tender and spiced with black bean sauce.  Very good.  The Szechuan beef and the Szechuan Shrimp were both full plates with plenty of thin sliced beef and veggies, and large shrimp in a thick bright red gravy, but lacking in true Szechuan flavor.  We added some house chili sauce after the fact, which helped a bit, but could not approach the fire quotient of cooking with the authentic flamethrowers.  Finally, the eggplant in garlic sauce was good, although it seemed American rather than Chinese eggplant was used.  \n\nWe enjoyed our meal (and birthday celebration).  The candle stuck in the cored/quartered orange and the singing of \"Happy Birthday,\" were very thoughtful touches and appreciated.  \n\nThis is one of the better suburban Chinese restaurants in this part of the world.  It makes up for lack of real Chengdu heat by the overall quality and skills apparent in their kitchen.  They would do themselves a favor by having the right spices above the stove for those who know what Szechuan food is supposed to taste like.  If they did, this place could be truly exceptional.",

    "text": "Chinatown Square on Race Street between 10th & 11th, is a nice attempt to bring Asian street food malls to Philly. It is a tiny version of these emporiums found on a grand scale in Flushing, NY, Toronto, and other major Chinese population centers. When done right in a large enough space, there are dozens of mini fast food outlets surrounding a central communal dining area where a group effort is required to scout for seats while the rest line up for the desired treats, and bring everything back to the demarked table. They are wildly successful.\n\nIt remains to be seen if Chinatown Square has the critical mass of enough choices balanced with adequate seating to make it. But, my first visit was fun and tasty, and will bring me back for more when in the mood for snacks reminiscent of all those delights experienced in travels through China, Thailand, Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia. There, when the sun goes down, the streets fill with bicycle kitchens setting up curbside cafes to grill the delicacies you select from the table spread in front of you, and served on miniature tables and stools on the sidewalk. Such a kick! \n\nThe Cambodian sausage and BBQ beef on a stick from Khmer Grill were both greasily excellent. Tart/sweet marinade, just enough firing to cook everything without drying out, and timely delivery into a styro take out container, made for a delicious bite and chew. \n\nThe other counters serving buns, gyros, Thai ice cream, etc., were all busy with happy folk talking or eyeing their phones. There is even a karaoke bar upstairs. \n\nKudos to the developer who put this together. She is on to something that should be popular and lead to copycats all over Chinatown and the surrounding streets. \n\nThis is just the beginning.",

It slow roasts ribs, brisket, pork and chicken to soft, pull-off-the-bone tenderness and rubs/bastes with quality dry and wet spices/sauces to produce a quality BBQ.  The house sits on this quiet backstreet, bracketed by Brian's and Di Napoli's, making for a tasty killers' row of excellent cuisine choices.  The interior space is designed for communal dining, so after ordering your food at the order window, look for seats along the long tables or wall counters, to await the call of your number at the pickup window.  \n\nYou won't think you've been transported to Memphis or St. Louis, but for eastern Pennsylvania/western Jersey this is damn good. It is every bit as flavorful as the better known Lucy's, Mission, Ben's, Famous Dave's in Bucks, or Smoke-N-Grill and 1911 Smoke House in Jersey, to name just a few. \n\nOur lunch of brisket and fried chicken sandwiches were loaded and delicious.  The beef was tender with a pleasant mildly spicy lasting taste.  My chicken was corn meal coated and fried just enough to leave the inner bird juicy. The aioli mayo and creamy coleslaw on top contributed nicely to the experience.  Side dishes of cornbread and baked beans were strong complementary textures and tastes - sweet cornbread was freshly baked, and the rich, savory beans were topped with pieces of burnt ends or pulled pork to enhance the chew.  Really got off on them beans! \n\nBoylan's Soda (Grape) was a sweet washdown with all the tang. \n\nWhile More Than Q is a small chain, it does have a local mom & pop feel to it.  \n\nWill def be back for the ribs.",

If you have been around for a while, they renovated the old joint formerly known as The Silo Restaurant. \n\nThe house is western style, with wooden tables, chairs floor and a back room bar big enough for a large party. Gonna have to sell a lot of mimosas to make that work well for morning meal. Still, the place is very attractive, even if I was there just for breakfast. \n\nI wanted a short stack of french toast, but that was not available. Three slices or tough luck. I ordered it, and waited for my first mugga joe. Service was friendly and there were plenty of servers on hand to handle the light customer presence at 8:30 am. The plate arrived with its cargo of well grilled and caramelized light loaf.  The kitchen did a good job with the egg, sugar, cinnamon and vanilla mix, which saturated the bread to its core. The edges and rises were nicely crunchified, and the application of butter and syrup made everything look terrific. The taste was very good, and even though I had asked for two slices, I found room for all three. The coffee was also strong, hot and kicky. \n\nThis was a superior breakfast. \n\nI did find the $15 cost for my solitary breakfast to be excessive. Nearly $3 for the java, even if unlimited, caught me off guard. How much could I drink? Two mugs at most. $9 for the FT also felt like an extravagance which I am unlikely to repeat often. They would do well to offer a more affordable choice (short stack) if they want to bring in the masses. \n\nI know PJ's is expanding rapidly right now, and just opened its fourth store in Kingston, NJ, but unless they want to be the hangout for only the rich and famous, they should find a few smaller/cheaper options.",

It is not in a traditional Jersey stainless steel case, but still offers adequate booths and a small 5 stool counter for lone wolves like me. \n\nAfter ordering the Country Steak Special (chicken fried steak, 2 eggs, home fries, rye toast & coffee), I settled in to watch the action on a busy Saturday morning. The staff seemed professional and appropriately friendly. They all wore cloth masks, with some carried beneath the nose, and thus useless. Same can be said of the customers waiting to be seated. Oh, well. It is hard to be constantly Covid vigilant.\n\nReally liked my meal, however. The breaded/fried steak was smallish, but crisp and tasty. I asked for the sausage gravy on the side, because I wanted to limit the heavy calorics from that chunky white sauce. They brought out a small bowl of it, when all I needed was one spoonful. It was excellent, but less was more for me. The scrambled eggs were good with a few shakes of Tabasco, and the home fries were plentiful and nicely browned and crunchy. Java was strong and bracing, and I appreciated that my request for milk resulted in a small stainless pitcher of moo juice, rather than mass produced creamers. The joe was included in the cost of the meal; a nice touch too often forgotten in the 21st C. \n\nThis was the best of my recent diner experiences, and helped reaffirm my historic enjoyment of this meal style.",

    "text": "Connecting Bridesburg, Philadelphia with Pennsauken, NJ, the Betsy Ross Bridge was opened to traffic over the mighty Delaware River in 1976. It moves vehicles well from one State to the other, helping commuters avoid heavy loads on Route I-95 during rush hour, or to simply bypass Center City density the rest of the day. I use it to travel from Bucks to Camden for court, and it saves me a bundle of time by circumnavigating the morning confusion at the Benjamin Franklin Bridge. \n\nBut, I admit to mixed emotions about using the Betsy because I know its construction history. The pilings on the Philly side are made up in large part of headstones from the Monument Cemetery that had interred people within it's hallowed grounds since 1839. Like its famous sister, Laurel Hill Cemetery, it was designed to reflect the sentiment of Pere Lachaise in Paris, France,  by being both a resting place for the dearly departed and a public park for the living. But, due to its relatively small size, once the 28,000 caskets were buried and there was no room for more, the maintenance fell off and the board of governors died or otherwise allowed the cemetery to fall into serious disrepair. \n\nTemple University offered to buy it several times for use as a parking lot, but was rebuffed repeatedly.\n\n Finally, the school saw its opportunity when the Betsy was being proposed. They again offered to buy it from the City if it would condemn it and seize by eminent domain. Philly agreed, and arranged to make the transfer if Temple would remove the bodies and headstones. This it did by notifying families of the deceased to retrieve the bodies and rebury them elsewhere. Only 8,000 were claimed, and the rest were transported to a mass unmarked grave in Lawnview Cemetery in Northeast. They then sold the granite and limestone markers to the bridge contractor who needed fill for the pilings upon which the upright supports would be anchored. \n\nThousands of headstones now lie underwater beneath the steel and can be seen sticking out at low tide. \n\nSo, when I cross dear old Betsy, I say a silent prayer for those whose lives were lived nearby and died only to be unceremoniously separated from their identities and dumped in a lost and unmarked grave, and their stone remembrances buried forever beneath the bridge. \n\n\"... Don't it always seem to go,\nthat you don't know what you've got 'till it's gone.\nThey paved paradise\nAnd put up a parking lot.\"\n\n-Joni Mitchell, Big Yellow Taxi, Ladies of the Canyon, 1970",

    "text": "BurgerIM is bastardized Hebrew for the word, \"Burgers\", \"IM\" being the suffix used for the plural. The company began selling franchises in 2008 after a successful launch in Israel a few years earlier. At one point eleven years ago, it was the fastest growing company in the stock market, with amazing earnings.\n\nUnfortunately, the annual reports were determined to be fraudulent. The CEO fled the country ahead of the SEC charging him with security violations and criminal conduct. Confronted by all that, and lack of logistical support, most franchisees lost their investments and closed their doors. Those few shops that remain are survivors struggling to make ends meet. This is true for the BurgerIM in Warrington, PA. \n\nGlad I made it while it was in business, because their business model is different than most fast casual joints. Their approach is the sale of multiple burgers in designer boxes, with more choice than most. Rather than just beef pucks and chicken fillets, they offer lamb and salmon alternatives, all customizable to taste. Too, they have excellent wings and a few potato choices as well as good onion rings and shakes.\n\nI used GrubHub to score a family box which included 8 burgers (4 Angus standards, 4 Spanish spicy), 6 Sweet/Hot Chili Wings, rings and fries. These are 3 oz burgers, but with trimmings, one sandwich and a couple of wings, were enough for a decent meal. This was about 4-6 meals depending on appetite, and the cost was $49. Kept my family with two still growing young men sated last night, with leftovers. \n\nThe curbside pickup worked well. Didn't get inside to check out the atmosphere. Honestly, I liked the wings more than the burgers, but they were still tasty enough to be satisfying. I imagine everything would be better right from the grill, but with Covid, it's just not worth the risk of hanging around inside. \n\nStill, the franchise has suffered due to the misdeeds of earlier management, so I hope these folks are around past social distancing and can demonstrate their worthiness thereafter.",

    "text": "When it comes to pizza, loyalty to a geographic region's tomato pie comes close to fanaticism. It is completely understandable that raging debates about whether Brooklyn or Pittsburgh or Trenton or Philly or some little shop on the wild streets of South Boston make the best pie.  But, the wise peacemakers among us know the secret - they are all the best if you love them. So much better to put aside parochial claims of superiority and just eat them all! Even the worst is so much better than what those poor souls have to accept as pizza in Colorado or some other state with altitude.\n \nJust mange and enjoy. Let your oralgasms carry you away...\n\nNewtown Pizza makes a decent pizza, but it will never be mistaken for an escapee from Napoli nor Roma, let alone Brooklyn Heights nor Chambersburg. Yet, walking by the display counter with all the attractive pies can set your glands a-squeezing, and the Trenton Pie is very aesthetically pleasing to the eye and tongue.  The crust holds the weight of the toppings firmly, perhaps because it is a bit thicker than Romana, and the ingredients are top shelf.  Still, the overall taste sensation is not the transcendent experience of  my favorite pizza shrines. Nonetheless, it is a standup slice worthy of consumption. \n\nThe Eggplant Parm is not always prime, as I have found it to be tough chewing at times.  The same goes for the steak sandwiches.  Mostly a good fill, but occasionally a little under or over grilled.  Just enough to keep you guessing. \n\nFriendly ownership, staff and crew, and a good citizen in the community.  \n\nAs offered at the top, to each his/her own when it comes to pizza. For those of us who love Ntown Pizza, the world is your oyster. Chow down close to home.  For the others of us who have different pizza needs, we know where to go to satisfy them, both near and far.\n\n8.27.13 I just had a couple of great slices of Newtown Pizza's Margarita Pie. Really excellent. I like a slightly charred crust because it tends to be crunchy and supportive of the weight above it.  This one was, with a mildly sweet sauce and fresh mozza, doctored with a light dusting of hot chili pepper flakes. Take a look at the photo.  It was as good as it looks. \n\nKeep it up fellas and cinco estrellas could be close at hand.",

Everything is completely automated, from drive in through drive out.  Similar to a car wash, your vehicle is driven onto a moving platform or track and from that point on, everything happens robotically. Your car is pushed left or right to align it with the entrance to the storage area.

They deliver timely sandwiches, soups, wraps, and a plentitude of snacks neatly packaged and with a smile. \n\nI prefer to eat later in the day and have stopped off there occasionally to order my own custom lunch.  They are willing to make anything off menu that they have the ingredients for, and do it well.  They are super efficient and friendly as a hard working husband and wife team.  \n\nWhat is really amazing is how much stuff they can cram into a small space and not seem cluttered and claustrophobic. \n\nGenerally, I am not a deli lunch kind of guy, as I prefer to have a more relaxing meal than sitting at my desk.  But, at crunch time, Circle Deli is a convenient and worthy alternative. \n\nI am a fan.",

I can understand some of the pejorative reviews from new customers, because they are not known and the young workers are not always people persons. \nStill, the product is good, and the prices reasonable. \nBottom line - I enjoy the walk from my office for a take out lunch on nice days, knowing I will return with a tasty sandwich along with the stroll through historic Newtown.\n\nPS. Becky's Deli now has 2 outdoor tables on nice days.",

    "text": "It has been a long time since I was in the Gray's Ferry neighborhood, and it was good to be back.  I had heard rumors about a Thai house that was opened at 25th & Christian serving up good and relatively authentic Thai cuisine out of a small storefront.  So, after a great massage @ V&V over at 11th and Washington, I headed west and found Thai Square sitting right on the corner.  \n\nParking can be an issue in these parts, but I was lucky to find a spot behind the restaurant on one of those super narrow backstreets. Parallel parking requires the front tire to go over the opposite curb to get the right angle for backing. Lucky my city skills had not abandoned me and I slid the chariot right into the space like a pro. So, I was feeling pretty good even before walking in. \n\nThe dining room was small, but clean, with the entire southern wall in glass overlooking a simple but attractive outdoor seating area.  The Madame moved toward us with a warm welcoming smile.  Handing us the menus, she suggested the specials and asked for our drink order.  The Ginger Tea she brought us a few moments later was excellent, with a nice ginger bite and honey background.  Our water was complemented by a small dish of squeezed lime juice and a small spoon.  Another great notion that brought the agua to life.  That was a first for me. Much better infused that a mere wedgely squeeze. \n\nWe were on a roll and the anticipation of what was to come grew.  While the Calamari was a small disappointment in that all the rings were large and coated in a hard jacket rather than a softer finish, the dipping sauce was good enough to demand we finish it with a spoon after the squid was gone. \n\nThen we received our Tamarind Duck and Shrimp Pad Thai.  \n\nThe Duck was nearly perfect.  Crisp skin.  Fully cooked and tender meat.  Tamarind Sauce that was sweetly tart and mild citrus finish, in a sultry dark red amber demi-glaze.  It was so good, I stuck my finger in it to suck it off. This was a treasure too special to waste a drop. \n\nThe Pad Thai was also very good; a full plate complemented with ground Peanut and fresh Sprouts.  It was a strong straight man to the wild machinations of the Duck.  \n\nThis was one of those meals that I didn't want to end.  I strung it out as long as possible with rice to absorb all the outrageous moisture on the platter, and another glass of water with lime to carry it all the way down.  \n\nYes. I took the rest home to savor tonight.\n\n4.5 Stars with a Bullet!",

    "text": "Stella's Pizza has been at this location on Scotch Road for more than 30 years, but this was my first visit.  \n\nThe impression is of an old style pizzeria with a side dining area.  When I arrived for a late lunch, Stella herself was sitting there having lunch and chatting with a customer.  I ordered an Eggplant Parm sandwich after seeing another sandwich order come out of the kitchen on a great looking torpedo roll.  It arrived at my table a few minutes later, nicely toasted and so inviting.  The bread comes from Italian Peoples' Bakery, and has that signature crispy crunch that is the beginning of a satisfying meal.  The eggplant was thin sliced, finely breaded and pan fried with minimal oil residue.  The tomato sauce was lightly salty, adding to the very positive overall experience.  All good.\n\nWhile the facility could use an updating, the quality of the food is very good, and the prices a throwback to about 1990.  $6.50 for a 9\" hot hoagie sandwich seems like an incredible deal, especially given the quality of the product.  It is easy to enjoy stepping back in time to an earlier day when a family operated restaurant meant the family was everywhere in the shop; cooking, cleaning, hosting, and just hanging out on breaks to talk with people.  I love the coziness that creates.  \n\nNone of this would work if the food was not good, but it is.  So, it will be easy to return to try the other offerings, especially the pizza, and learn more about Stella, her family, and the history of a typical old fashioned family resto.",

Kelch House was recommended by a local businessman we were visiting, and he was right on with his suggestion. The five of us had a variety of things on the menu, and all of us were happy with our choices. \n\nI had the Apple and Feta Salad, consisting of Granny Smith slices, Romaine, Candied Walnuts, and a good amount of fresh Feta Cheese.  The Balsamic was a nice taste to wrap it all together. A good meal @ $9.  Looking at my mates I observed various stages of gluttony displayed over a Cheesesteak and French Onion Soup.  Someone mentioned the Fries were excellent.   \n\nThe facility is dressed in colonial attire, with large windows bringing in wonderful light. The view of the river from our table was great on this autumn day. \n\nDefinitely worth a special visit to return to both Kelch House and Bristol. \n\nWell done, City!",

    "text": "Stopped in recently about a half hour before closing on a weeknight.  Although not at all crowded, the warm brick/old wood ambiance mixed well with the several customers hanging on into the night.  The exposed brick and long bar anchored the room, while the wooden tables and chairs offered the sense of an Old City establishment that could have existed at any time since the late 18th Century.  In fact, the foundation was that old.  Walking in from cobblestone streets completed the impression that Prime Stache doubled as a time machine. \n\nI sat briefly at the bar waiting for my companion to arrive for a late business discussion.  No pressure to order a drink after explaining my purpose, and the bartendress was friendly and attractive.  I had a chance to settle in and look around.  I liked everything I saw.  The bar menu looked appealing, and as a former barkeep I appreciated the fresh fruit and infusion jars resting around the work area.  I was tempted, but knew I needed a clear head.  Still, I have a strong desire to try something creative next time I come.  \n\nMy contraparty arrived and we moved to a table.  She was hungry and ordered Turkey Sliders.  An app of Sweet Saut\u00e9ed Carrots arrived first.  They were small and thin and obviously a local produce.  Nice snappy sweetness.  We discussed our businesses while awaiting the main course, and switched to questions that we could answer for each other while she enjoyed the mini burgers.  Really wish I was more hungry, but observing her face as she ate was a clear indication of high enjoyment.  I continued to sip away as our comfort level with the space and each other grew into a more detailed and tangential discussion.  \n\nWe ended up closing the place.  All the other chairs were up on their tables when we finally walked out.  \n\nPrime Stache is known as an American Bistro.  The quality of the environment, drinks, and the food, makes it something more than that. While the word, \"Stache,\" suggests both a Golden Age of American history, as well as a slightly out of date image for a modern resto, it successfully sets itself apart by a consistency of atmos, service, and product that liberate from the constraints of time and place, and bring you into a timelessness that is compelling.  \n\nI am excited about returning here again, and that makes me a fan.",

The visions were astounding. When feeling flush, I asked for flavored brandy to replace the water in the pipe, so I could completely experience the transition from hookah/coffee house to Bedouin's tent in a secret desert oasis.\n\nVisions of Scheherazade, Princess of Persia and storyteller of the 1001 Tales of the Arabian Nights, await...",

    "text": "Tonight I went in for a light meal while waiting for my son to finish a Magic tournament at Oxford Valley Mall. I just couldn't bring myself to go to its food court, so I drove down Oxford Valley Road and remembered Jahan Kabob. \n\nWhile the craft beer retail outlet dominates, this time, I was able to order a Falafel Pita and Rice, and sit with my excellent meal and ignore the rest.  The food was wonderful. The Falafel was fresh and moist even after deep frying.  The Pita was warm and pliant.  The Lettuce, Onions and Tahini Sauce was all perfect complements.  The Long Grain Basmati-like Rice was prepared with a rich spiciness that was very soft and tasty.  I usually don't enjoy rice as anything more than a sponge to sop up sauce.  This rice was exceptionally moist and flavorful.  It was a great side.\n\nClearly, this place has knock out cuisine inside a rather incongruous setting of a craft beer store.  If it was in its own space, it would pack in the diners.  \n\nWhile it is not the place to bring a date, and is primarily a take out joint, the food taken out of this context is first rate, and really an amazing opportunity to sample Afghani kitchen craft.  The owner/chef is also a first class host and salesman for his food. \n\nA bump to 4 Stars is the right move.",

His \"Little Mama\" is Salvadoran and Mexican cuisine done with a flourish.  This is no Chipotle fast food experience, although the ingredients are equally fresh, but more creative and satisfying on the palate. \n\nI was there for lunch, and limited myself to a few dishes, one Apperitivo (Guacamole Mamita), and Empanadas (hand made corn turnovers stuffed with chicken, spices and beans).  The Guac was excellent.  Smooth, cool, and so easy in the mouth.  The Empanada was crusty and flaky with just enough heat to keep the tongue on guard.  The chicken filling was chunky and soft. Really well done. \n\nBottom Line - a totally satisfying, if somewhat cher, Almuerzo. \n\nA good place to go for a business lunch to impress your clients with your international panache. \n\nNext time, the Hamburguesa Mexicana comes off the board and onto my plate. A burger with jalapenos, onions and hot pepper cheese with a side of yucca fries has got to be incredible.\n\n10.01.2013  -  Returned today for lunch.  Had the Hamburguesa Mexicana as promised. It came out loaded with cheese, jalapenos, lettuce, tomato, and avocado and a perfect medium rare.  The bun appeared to be toasted baguette-style loaf and a good fit for the innards.  Liked it a lot.  Only downside were the Yucca Fries, which were too dry and bland.  Asked for ketchup to give it some life. \n\nStill a 4 Star attraction, as everything was enjoyable, especially the Mexican environment, and wild colors.  Definitely got that right.",

Let's hope the third time is a charm!\n\nThis tiny shop in the 1300 block of South Broad Street, Trenton, NJ, has been washed and painted, and provided new furniture (all 3 tables), in the attempt to attract and keep customers who need Italian takeout in this south Trenton neighborhood.  The owner is from Ecuador.  He is expanding his restaurant business from his \"2 Brothers\" location in Ewing near the College of New Jersey.  He is friendly and loquacious, and readily engaged in conversation about his new enterprise (open only 3 weeks).  He explained that this part of the capital city was already loaded with good Latin American restaurants, but was light in the pizza/cheesesteak category.  He was hopeful of filling this void. \n\nIf my Chicken Cheesesteak was any example, he has a good chance to succeed.  Their lunch special of sandwich, fries and cold drink for $6.50 was certainly priced to please.  Served on a ceramic plate, rather than paper, the sandwich also contained saut\u00e9ed Spinach and the Fried Onions he suggested.  It was nicely presented for in house consumption, which I appreciated given that often times the meal is in take away form regardless of intention to eat right there.  That's treating the customer right.\n\nAs with every place I've been this past week, the air conditioning was overwhelmed by the heat of the day, not to mention the ovens, so I ate with a light sweat beading on my brow and dampening my shirt.  That did not deter me from enjoying lunch, as sometimes it is nice to roll with the elements, just like in the good old days before universal AC.  \n\nThe food was good and tasty.  The only suggestion would be to improve the quality of the rolls to have a crustier bite.  There are many bakeries around Trenton that make great bread.  It may be more expensive than the regional soft roll providers, but I would gladly pay a little extra for a Wonder Roll from Italian Peoples down on Butler Street.",

I was there for late lunch and was at the cashier to order General's Chicken, Hot & Sour Soup and hot tea.  My meal arrived about ten minutes later on a large white ceramic bowl for the General, and small dish with flat bottom spoon for the soup.  A small mound of white rice was provided as accompaniment. \n\nThe Hot & Sour was full of tofu, mushrooms, carrot slivers, sprouts and a little pork.  No MSG in sight (thank goodness).  They used a vinegar that I was not familiar with, changing the flavor just a bit to the sweeter side.  I liked it, but the traditional vinegar would have probably enhanced the enjoyment for me. The chicken was not heavily breaded before deep frying, a definite plus.  The deep tamarind-colored goop was perhaps also sweeter than expected, but then again, I did not request that it be spicy.  There were some small pieces of chili pepper in the mix, but not enough to reach the balance of sweet and spice that the General is known for. Still, I liked it, and saw that preparation was well presented. \n\nI would return to Sesame Chinese Bistro if the opportunity presented itself, but don't consider it more than a pretty good Chinese/American house, where I would visit for lunch, but not for a dinner when a more authentic MIddle Kingdom and Szechuanese hot and numbing meal is my preference.",

    "text": "I get the excitement everyone has about Comfort Food and Kitchenette.  It is an amazing place for Morrisville, Pa., and if it is a sign of things to come, this town is in for a renaissance.  The space is open and light.  Exposed industrial ceilings.  Brightly colored walls. Open kitchen.  Lots of interesting chachkas. Friendly service.  Locally sourced and health oriented menu (where possible). \n\nThe Pickle Brined Fried Chicken Sandwich with homemade Potato Chips came on strong, with a large breast of chicken, dipped in heavy batter, and fried to a golden brown.  The bird was still juicy under its new skin, and the tomato, lettuce, mayo accompaniment was harmonic.  Too big for handling, I resorted to knife and fork to demolish it.  Crunchy and tasty.  If there is a criticism, it is in how the breading/batter used to coat the chicken turned into a hard shell, rather than attaching itself to the chicken.  Although it tasted good, it cracked with each cut and was eaten separately from the bird.  Admittedly, this was a deboned breast, and not designed for hand to hand combat.  Still, I prefer when the breading and meat hang together and allow them to be eaten simultaneously, without an outer jacket falling away from the chicken beneath.  It was tasty, nonetheless.  The Chips, while flavorful, were too fry-centric alongside the chicken for one plate.  Cut fruit would have been better for me.  \n\nLive and learn. \n\nWill return for at least one more round from this kitchen.  There were a lot of happy faces and kvelling sounds all around, suggesting that I may have simply made the wrong choice in selecting fried chicken in such an avant garde coolio joint.",

    "text": "Genius.\n\nA Dim Sum Sports Bar in Chinatown!\n\nWho'd a thunk that a hybrid Asian oriented kitchen with a beer dominated sports bar would work?  I hadn't, but I am sure glad the guiding hands behind Bar-ly did.  This is a fun and original spot, and likely a theme that will be duplicated around the country. \n\nA greatly enhanced environment after the former tenants, a 60 label beer menu, and enough wide screens to allow everyone their own view.  The food is decent, with choices from spring rolls to kimchee cheesesteaks, with Japanese, Korean Chinese, Vietnamese and American influences throughout the offerings.  I had the boiled dumplings and a burger. Both were good, but not best in breed. Checking on the other plates exiting the kitchen, everything looked attractive, and the patrons seemed to enjoy the victuals. \n\nIf I was strictly interested in a good meal, I might chose a different restaurant that was more sedate and allowed for whispered conversation.  However, if the idea is a fun and fluid afternoon of football with above average bar food, or a Thursday night of Flyers, Sixers, or Phillies, with friends and compatriots, this place is definitely on the short list of cool places to hang out and get loud.  \n\nKudos to Bar-ly. They have created a unique environment that acknowledges and celebrates the cross fertilization of two amazing cultures.  Go for a visit and take it in. \n\nGood times for all.",

It is part of a three restaurant local chain that have a good reputation for authentic Thai cuisine in a nice atmosphere.  My experience at lunch confirms that opinion. \n\nI entered about 1:00 PM and was seated at a deuce at the front window. Cool view of a bustling Fayette Street.  The menu was presented by an attractive server who directed me to the specials page offering a prix fixe of soup, salad/app and entr\u00e9e for $9.95.  Sounded good, but I knew I couldn't eat that much, so ordered the Vegetarian Drunken Noodles. \n\nWhile waiting, I took in the d\u00e9cor of the dining room. It was simple, yet beautifully appointed with wall and ceiling hangings from home. Lots of color and texture. The staff was likewise adorned in native dress.  It wasn't difficult to remember my days relaxing in Chaingmai after business in Bangkok. Brought a secret smile to my face. \n\nThe large platter arrived quickly - a massive load of broad noodles, chopped broccoli, carrots, onions, sprouts and cubes of tofu in a moderately spicy sauce. Really flavorful and good mix of textures, shapes and colors. As beautiful as the sarong on the woman serving me. \n\nVery much enjoyed my lunch, and would not hesitate to return here, or to the other restaurants in their portfolio.",

No one left early, and many remained to listen to our local musicians make merriment. \n\nHomewood Suites is definitely a place to consider for your next meeting or event.

    "text": "There is no doubt that the Tanner Brothers Store that sits at the intersection of Almshouse and Hatboro Roads in Warminster, Pa., could use an extreme makeover to improve the shopping cart traffic patterns, and modernize the check out, but if that were done it would likely sacrifice all that it has been and continues to be.  What's that?  Only a well used, still functional, farm stand for the farm run by the family of that name for generations.  There wasn't a fraction of the population nor vehicular traffic in those days.  It was about the only game in town for fresh produce, dairy and other kitchen necessities before the Acmes, Clemens, and other grocery chains started pushing north into Bucks County.  Seen it this light, it is actually an anthropology museum with daily changing interactive exhibits. \n\nCompared to those modern markers, Tanner Bros does suffer in the amenities department, but makes up for it with generally fresher produce, cheaper eggs, and excellent handmade ice cream.  Sure, as a convenience and secondary marketing attraction, it offers national brands on its shelves, and those things are not as competitively priced.  But, when we plan well, we hit Tanner's first, and then make a run to Giant or its ilk for everything else.  Makes us feel good to shop locally, and spend a little time in the past.  \n\nIt's great to have large bins full of yams, corn, melons, leeks, etc., to touch and choose.  And, after lugging it all back to the car, to take a few more minutes to appreciate (and slowly consume) a great Butter Pecan Sugar Cone while watching the cows that manufactured the milk for it, lazily chewing their cud in preparation for the next milking.",

It has four or five booths, but business is obviously primarily take out. I stopped in for lunch this week and found the place bright and friendly, if a tad disheveled. However, their pies on display looked very appealing, and I opted for two king size slices reheated to well done, and a Snapple.  At $6 and change, it was a good deal. \n\nThe slices were very thin, yet firm enough to hold their points high and proud, without a quiver nor bended knee.  It was crisp, hot, and tasty and had splashes of chunky sauce throughout that reminded of tomato pie, but was in fact still a pizza with plenty of cheese visible beneath the red blotches. A heavy shake of crushed red pepper, and the slices came to life.  They were very good, with little drip or drop. \n\nIn fact, this lunch was far better than anticipated, and was one of the better pizza surprises of the past year. I would certainly return for a fresh pie and to sample their cheesesteaks.  \n\nIf they found time to clean up the house, and put away all the unfinished boxes and cases of soda sitting in the back, Valentino's could find itself a nice romantic table for two hole in the wall for those wanting a private conversation over cracker crisp crusty pizza.",

Regardless, everything was surprisingly good. \n\nNo problem with service, either. The size of our group provided all the incentive necessary to get us plenty of attention.

A few brave souls sat outside, but after standing in the humid 90 degree heat at The Garden of Reflection to commemorate 9.11, there was no way I wanted more of it.  Today, the sun won. \n\nMy first visit here in New Hope, and the facility was spacious with big bar on one side, and dining room on the other.  We sat is a dark corner to discuss business although part of my mind and all my heart was elsewhere.  Triumph is proud that it locally sources its provisions and is serious about sustainable agriculture.  Way cool!  \n\nI had a half sized Watermelon Salad consisting of red and yellow sweet melon with Watercress and a light dressing.  It was exactly right for today - cool, pleasantly refreshing.  I read on Yelp that the Calamari was good, so when the wait person suggested that or Grilled Chicken, Beef, or Shrimp on the salad, I jumped at the squid.  It was not on top of the salad, but in a separate plate because there was so much of it.  Tasted like good Calamari should - crisp without oiliness, nicely spiced to offset the innate mildness of the crustacean. I took most of it home.  \n\nSorry to say, it was too early to try any of the beer, and the heat would have turned the day into an Albert Camus novel. So, will return again to explore that end of the menu.\n\nA very nice place, adequate parking (metered), and better than average healthy food. Very satisfied, and plan on going back soon.\n\nGood business meeting, too.",

    "text": "It is great to see a new food hospitality business open its doors in Trenton, NJ. \n\nStudio B Bakery & Bistro operates in the space of prior galleries and restos that were not able to survive the vicissitudes of street life in Jersey's capital city.  Yet, this one feels like it has a chance to make it.  The space is utilitarian and simple, but comfortable.  They sell attractive bakery goods and offer breakfast and lunch that is traditional, yet creative in the use of ingredients and awareness of contemporary dietary concerns.  The staff dresses in black Ts, and is certainly friendly.  \n\nI walked in just after 1 in the afternoon, looking for lunch and a good review.  The menu was high on the wall behind the counter.  The Pecan Chicken Salad caught my attention, and when I inquired about the availability of sandwich or panini, was told that the only option was a brioche roll.  No problem. I like brioche.  It came (eventually) with a side of sweet potato fries. I requested hot green tea on a chilled rainy day.  \n\nWhat was not mentioned was that although the front of the house was not busy, the kitchen was slammed with a large project (never explained), and that I would likely have to wait more than 30 minutes to be served.  Luckily, I wasn't in a rush, and I spent the time productively reading.  \n\nWhen the plate was bought to me, it was quite attractive.  The chicken salad was curried, with a load of pecans, lettuce, red onion, on a standard looking hamburger roll (not brioche).  Again, no explanation for the change, nor apology.  Still, I liked the meal.  The chicken was tasty with a pleasant lasting flavor on the tongue.  The sweet potato fries were plentiful, crisp and a nice change of pace.  \n\nAt the end, the owner came over and apologized for the delay. He seemed a decent, high energy and sincere guy.  A little better communication up front would have been appreciated along with a check in during the meal to see if I needed anything.  Not biggies, but just enough to warrant less than full throated endorsements, and a wait and see attitude for what I hope will be a major success on South Broad Street, within walking distance of my office.\n\nUPDATE: MARCH 1, 2017 - I went in for breakfast this morning after court.  There were only a few other patrons around the house.  I sat at the counter and was promptly assisted by one of the two servers in black T's.  I ordered the Orleans Scamble, a three egger with sausage, onion, parsley, crisped shredded potato and cheese, and their chicory enhanced java.  The white plate arrived a few minutes later looking great with a dusting of parsley around the edges and the meal piled up in a line mid-plate.  A few shakes of Crystal Louisiana Hot Sauce and I was good to mange.  It was very good and quite filling. I appreciated the mix of flavors and textures, although a minute less on the grill for wetter eggs would have been my preference.  The coffee was hot and the chicory was a refreshing reminder of how joe is done in The Big Easy. Would have been even better if a refill had been offered.  \n\nSolid and enjoyable. Still a 4 Star experience, until those small niceties are mastered.",

We decided to try Jade Harbor first, and were able to park right behind the kitchen in the alley (please don't tell anyone else).  This Guangdong emporium has a few dining rooms on the first and second floors.  The tables in each are packed tight to squeeze in as many customers as possible, and the narrow trail from the rear kitchen to the front of the house is often clogged with people moving around to get to their seats or restrooms.  Actually, that is something of a good thing, as it forces the carts to navigate slowly or at full stop next to your table to allow a close inspection of the goodies, and to ask the women handling them for more information.  \n\nWe were seated behind the entry door to one of the dining rooms.  Three chairs, but really room for only two.  At least we did not have to wait.  Hot tea arrived quickly, followed by the first of many cart visits.  We asked questions and snagged seven dishes from Shrimp Shumai and Beef Meatballs to Watercress Dumplings and Sticky Rice Balls with Lotus for dessert.  Everything was good to nearly best of breed.  Special mention for the Sticky Rice Pork Dumplings that were sweet on the outside and savory within.  They were a first for me.  \n\nAs Bustleton is closer to home than a trip downtown, we will no doubt find our way back here with some regularity when the dim sum bug hits us.  That I was the only \"foreigner\" in a house full of Chinese families suggests that this place may actually be as authentic as the banquet halls on Race Street. Jade Harbor certainly seemed that way to me and my beautiful Chinese companion. \n\nWill explore the other dim sum shop down the street and get back to you.",

More chairs and a larger room would have been helpful, but the organization cannot be blamed for the substantial turnout to hear the two gentlemen answer questions submitted by the audience.  \n\nThis is the way democracy is supposed to work.  If someone wants your vote and thinks they have the qualities needed to make an exceptional public servant, they must stand before us and let us see them with all their strengths and weaknesses.  Transparency in past experience and future policy positions are essential to intelligent decisions by the electorate.  \n\nWhat was most remarkable was how similar their answers were to most questions.  They both seemed so amenable to listening to each other, and working together whenever possible.  \n\nOh, that this was really so!\n\nYet, this was all somewhat less than honest due to what was not addressed at all.  Each party they represent operates collectively.  The track record of the party in majority or minority is just as important as what an individual candidate believes.  After all, politicians don't work in a vacuum.  They take their positions according to what their leadership dictates.  The influence of a rookie representative (both would be new), is less than minimal, especially if plum committee assignments, reelection and promotion are desired.  Unfortunately, they were not questioned about the position of their party on the important issues, nor how they would deal with disagreements they had with leadership.  Without that information, it was too easy to say whatever they believed, without any grounding in reality. \n\nOpportunity lost.  \n\nStill, in my view, one was clearly superior to the other in terms of intelligence, thoughtfulness, compassion and experience.

The folks working there are very friendly, and welcomed this first timer with warm greetings. I took a seat at the counter across from the Bunn O Matic where Ellis coffee was being brewed.

These people were on their game. \n\nThere was a list of omelettes, benedicts, pancakes/French toast, and combo platters, but I decided on a standard breakfast sandwich of sausage, egg and cheese on kaiser. The side of home fries with grilled pepper and onion bits was also too tempting to pass up. \n\nThe sammy was doubled up, making for a fat and filling meal in its own right. The taters were alright, but despite the flavor from the sauteed onion/pepper, the tubers themselves were a bit dry like they had been sitting on the corner of the grill too long. Maybe my arrival at 10:00 had some to do with that, but a word to the wise...\n\nLoved the Ellis java, which was refilled as often as I desired. \n\nGroveland Grill is definitely worth your breakfast attention.",

    "text": "Thanks to all you Yelpers who pointed the way to House of Thai Cuisine on Cottman Avenue in the Mayfair section of Northeast Philly.  It really is a great find!\n\nBut, it did not seem that way when we first arrived on the scene.  Saturday night was the early celebration for St. Patrick's Day.  The streets were a sea of green -  drunken green. We had to weave our way around the crowded sidewalks, police corners, and pools of liquid whatever making for an obstacle course.  The block is not particularly attractive, and given the weirdness of the evening, I wondered how comfortable we would be once we entered the restaurant.  Would it be full of green curry? \n\nAmazingly, once we opened the door and went inside the world became quiet.  We were the only ones in the house.  The space was beautiful - classy wood floor, linen tablecloths and nice lighting. We were greeted by the owner/manager, who was gracious and seemed oblivious to the crashing roar outside.  In his domain, he was in control.  \n\nThe food was very good, too.  The Spicy Seafood Soup was loaded and tartly spiced.  My Vegetable Soup was full up with veg chunkies and Tofu, but could have been a bit hotter.  The Massaman Curry with Tofu and Sweet Potato was delicious, but surprisingly sweet.  My Drunken Noodles with Beef was simply great - a mountain of wide flat noodles, a ton of thin sliced beef, and a wonderful sauce.  I inhaled it. I did not even connect the fact that the roaring throng might be drawn to my inebriated pasta. \n\nThe room slowly filled up, and even a few carousers in emerald beads and hats came in to chill over a Thai meal.  The atmosphere was calming and their welcome by the boss directed their energies well.  No problems. \n\nI really liked House of Thai Cuisine and put it in the class of my local favorite, Aroi Thai in Southampton.  When I want the distinctive urban charm of Mayfair, I will find myself there again.",

    "text": "One door closes and another door opens. \n\nWe were visiting the New Castle National Historic District when the choking heat and humidity finally crashed down on town in a major thunderstorm. We hung out in the local tavern as long as we could, but still hoped to catch a look at the beautiful courthouse in the center of the old city. We were late, as it closed at 4:30, but we did walk around the perimeter and grounds for a while. \n\nHeading across Delaware Street, I noticed a sign pointing to a coffee house in a cobblestone alley. Trader's Cove's entrance was deep in that alley, and it also had \"Secret Garden\" behind the building that held the cafe. We went in to load up on caffeine before heading home.  Their expresso area was tiny with small display for pastry and miniscule kitchen behind that. We ordered chai latte and a cappuccino, with two small pastries (apple fritter and slice of apple walnut coffee cake). Once prepared we sat it the back room to drink and nosh. \nTurned out that there was musical entertainment waiting for us. Two guys with acoustic guitars played and sang for us. Called themselves The Grantwriters, because they both had worked for non-profits and that was what they did. Their style was 50s - 70s soft rock, a la The Everly Brothers sound. Very pleasant. \nAn unexpected interlude, but appreciated. We listened for a while as the room filled with a group of elders who seemed to be having a meeting there. They needed more seats, so we exited, walked through the Magic Garden, and took our leave of New Castle. \n\nIn fact, from beginning to end the whole Delaware Day had been so magical.\n\nPS. The java and cakes were good, too. Local roaster and baker. Nice find we might have missed if the courthouse was still open.",

    "text": "Robin Hood, the robbing hoodlum of Sherwood Forest, was known for taking from the rich and redistribution to the less fortunate. In many ways this diner-esque restaurant in Southampton, PA, is true to that calling. They turn out large, very good meals at excellent prices for their loyal customers. Open 24/7, it is an anchor of the community. \n\nWe stopped in for a Presidents' Day breakfast to relax on a Monday morning without work. The house was a bit more than half full and we we're quickly taken to a small table along the windowed wall. Coffee arrived with the requested milk, and we gave our order for a short stack of french toast, side of hash, and a standard scrambled, bacon, potatoes and whole wheat. It was all quite good.\n\nThe frenchies were constructed of large slices of texas toast with caramelized edges and pleasant vanilla flavor. Two slices were more than enough. The corned beef hash was likewise crispy with mellow savoriness. The packaged syrup took it down a notch, where real maple would have made it exceptional. The eggs were the right consistency - just north of soft, and the taters plentiful. We both commented on our enjoyment of the meals, and compared them to other recent experiences that we're not as good at more expensive locations. \n\nRobin Hood was definitely one to remember.\n\nPRO TIP - We were disappointed upon getting the bill and finding an extra charge for bacon when the menu indicated it was part of a breakfast special. Either we missed the fine print, or there wasn't any, that the special was not available on holidays like Presidents' Day. Not that it would have made a difference, but it would have been nice to be told this before settling on our order. Our server said she didn't know about it, and she was advised to add the charge by management. Foolish move. Now they have to see this addendum to an otherwise positive review.\n\nMaybe they thought I could afford it, and they were the ones in need, so a little extra pinch was merely income redistribution. No. It was just bad business.",

In this, at least Sandy, the spirited face and personality of this breakfast/lunch house, has succeeded.  Layoffs come and go, but they were willing to take their assets and start something new.  Sandy may have been a nurse in a past life, but she is a full frontal restauranteur now.  She excels in her house personality role, and has no trouble picking up where ever needed.  Her husband, still on the force at Trenton PD, lives his dream through her.  \n\nSix years are long enough to settle in and dig deep roots in this downtown neighborhood.  They have a good thing going.  The dining area is small, but their takeaways are strong.  To keep things streamlined and efficient, customers order at the cashier in front of the kitchen from the many wallboards describing the menu.  Breakfast is a short list, but lunch has a lot to offer.  From salads to sandwiches; wraps to paninis, the ingredients are fresh each day, and the product well stuffed with food and love.  Take a seat or stand aside, and your meal will be delivered unto you. \n\nSandy recommended the Baja Wrap on Wrap Wednesday.  I accepted her challenge on spinach tortilla.  It arrived full of black beans, onion, pepper, lettuce, chicken and a mild chipotle sauce.  The package included soft drink and cookie or granola bar.  It was tasty and filled me completely.  Atmosphere was active and noisy, full of table conversation from engaged folk.  \n\nEast Front Caf\u00e9 is a keeper, with awesome personality and legit plates to satisfy the hungry beast within.",

Capital Health - Hopewell is but one beautiful example of the new breed in institutional medicine. \n\nOn a recent visit to a client I was overwhelmed by two things. First, the crowded parking lot that left drivers hunting for space both front and back of the buildings. Finally found a few near the emergency room entrance, but still far from the circular drive. Second, given this, how empty the actual hospital was. There were very few people in the lobby, gift shop, cafeteria and halls on this midweek morning. Maybe everyone was is surgery or the gym taking Zumba classes. \n\nBut, it was obvious that little expense was spared in the building materials, with wood and stone everywhere. The private room I saw was hard to differentiate from a three or four star hotel, with the exception of the absence of bathroom Jacuzzi. My friend was very comfortable, indeed. The staff seemed to be a full complement, with doctors, nurses, technicians, therapists, and orderlies scurrying to and from assignments. \n\nThis is what they mean by, \"...progressive, quality patient care with significant investments in our exceptional physicians, nurses and staff, as well as advanced technology.\" It includes a Level II regional trauma center, stroke center, perinatal, Level III NICU and emergency mental health screening facilities, and the region's first Pediatric Emergency Department (including, autism-friendly pediatric E.R.). And, what would a state of the art medical center be without a neuroscience institute, comprehensive breast care and digestive health centers, Cancer Center, Heart & Vascular Institute, and orthopedic joint replacement \"Center of Excellence?\" There are numerous awards associated with these efforts, and to be sure, they all cost exorbitant amounts of money. \n\nNo doubt, we will all be glad everything is there in Hopewell if we need it some day.",

The combo meals as with most Chinese places offer a cup of soup, egg roll and entree with choice of rice and the ubiquitous broccoli sprigs in a price range from $6.95 to $7.95, including hot tea, hard noodles and duck sauce.  Service is prompt and courteous.  The owner is usually present to oversee operations, and she makes a point of checking with the diners. \nThis is typical Chinese-American cuisine, tending to the sweet Cantonese style most liked by western palates.  If you go for this kind of Chinese food, this is a good place.  If you are more adventurous, or know and like the dishes served in China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, or our bigger cities' Chinese communities, then this may not float your boat. \nIf you like the spicy Szechuan style, you will have to hunt further in my reviews to find one.\nMy usual lunch: Hot and sour soup, egg roll, orange beef and rice.  Satisfying. \n\n2.20.13 - After further review, and multiple lunches, an upgrade to 4 stars is warranted. I must be a fan to continue to return here for lunch on an almost weekly basis.\n\n6.10.18 - The Dragon relocated to the old Meglio's site about a year ago. Smaller space, but same kitchen skills. Prices for lunch specials are now up to $8.50, likely reflecting moving, renovation and rental costs. Worth the increase for the far above average Chinese/ American house that is as prepared for you to grab a table as for picking up the well packaged take out. \n\nPhilamena continues to run a solid, tasty operation.",

Bravo is the real deal, not just a reasonable facsimile for folks who don't know from authentic Viet cuisine. The menu is extensive, and the noodle soup (pho) and rice dishes (com) are excellent. The owners and chef are legit from Hanoi, and know their way around a Vietnamese kitchen.

Same accoutrements (Thai basil, sprouts, jalapeno slices, lime wedge), and same great taste, but with beef/pork stuffed wontons. I thought it was a very good version of the classic. \n\nWhy not five star? Well, because I am spoiled by visiting Vietnam and eating incredible food in both the north and south of the country. The small houses in Philly and Ocean Grove, California are often excellent, and this one may yet transport me to the Mekong River as those do.

Both the family and the bakery have moved around, but always remained Philly centric. Their recipes travelled well.\n\nToday, their storefront is small and lined with glass display cases and shelved walls, all full of their classic cookies, doughnuts, cupcakes, custom iced cakes and amazing pound cake. My small sample of half dozen doughnuts (glazed, vanilla iced, cinnamon sugar and powdered sugar) were all fresh, lightly yeasty and full of sweet flavor. They were perfect for accompaniment with hot coffee. \n\nThe vanilla pound cake was dense, moist and was solidly superior to any commercial effort I have eaten. Better even than Starbucks, which has been on my pedestal for a long while. It would have been great heated with a scoop of ice cream, but stood unapologetically on its own. Why they loaded it up on three sides with copious amounts of white icing is a mystery. It was truly an amazing sugar coating, but unnecessary given the quality of what it covered. Diabetic overkill. \n\nThat shelf of large Eagles playoff cakes looked great and gave comfort that they would be the hit of any party or cold afternoon tailgate at the Linc. Unfortunately, the sweetness would not be enough to change the outcome of the game to come.",

Otherwise, the same Sprouts, Thai Basil, Jalapeno Slices, and Lime Wedges were available as desired. The taste slides up the heat scale and adds another dimension to the otherwise wonderful flavors of the traditional Pho.  A lot of sliced Steak in there, too.

    "text": "Met up with a friend the other night at Hot On D Spot, a Trinidadian Restaurant at the western end of Nottingham Way in Hamilton, tres close to Trenton.  Don't know about you, but I had never tried Trini cuisine before; and in fact while I knew that Trinidad was an island in the Caribbean, I knew little of its history and culture.  My loss. \n\nTrinidad was settled by a mix of folks who really did not want to be there - African slaves and Indian indentured servants (almost slaves).  They mixed together into a very interesting and spicy society.  The food evolved into something that did not look or taste like either's home cooking.  It was sort of like Indian with similar breads and curry orientation, but with meat on the bone dishes that were of a different continent.  \n\nRegardless, the food was great. We had some Doubles - basically Chickpea and Potato mash with Curry in small round Naan-like soft breads.  Very tasty and definitely a cousin of Samosa.  Next I ordered Roti with Boneless Chicken, while my companion went with Roti and Goat.  Both had a side of the same mix of Chickpea and Potato found in the Double.  I thought the Chicken outshined the Goat.  It was tender and in small pieces long cooked in a spice pot.  The Goat was still on the bone.  It required more work to eat it, and to my palate, was darker and more gamey than I like.  \n\nThe accompanying Roti was superb.  It was large and folded up on the plate, but as it was taken out and ripped apart to be used to pick up the meats and veggies, it had elasticity and a ground Chickpea and spice dusting on the inside that added taste and a curiously fine grit to the experience.  I could not finish it.  \n\nI hope to learn how to eat with one hand without using utensils and just pinching the food with the Roti.  It is much harder than it looks, especially if you try not to get your hand dirty.  \n\nThe owners and staff were very friendly.  We engaged in a running conversation about the food and life in Trinidad.  Fascinating.  The house only has four tables and a fridge with cold drinks.  I stopped beforehand to pick up a six pack of Red Stripe to add to the festivities. \n\nThis one is a definite keeper.",

    "text": "Ironically, our plan was to walk over to 3rd & Chestnut after taking care of a few things in Chinatown.  The original destination was Han Dynasty in Old City so we could sample what was reputed to be among the best Szechuanese in Philly.  \n\nBut, as John Lennon so cuttingly observed, \"Life's what happens while you're busy making other plans...\"  On our way down Arch we saw the sign for Szechuan Dim Sum Restaurant.  We had been looking forward to a brisk after rain walk, but on seeing this convenient alternative, we wordlessly took each other's hand, made a hard right and jaywalked directly to their front door. Not much traffic on this Saturday afternoon, or we might have been less impulsive. \n\nWe walked in to an almost empty house, with seven wood top tables and a mirrored wall.  There were two servers, also acting as hosts.  The young woman shepherded us to a table mid-shop, and dropped off two menus.  She asked what we wished to drink, and brought a nice aromatic hot black tea moments later.  The set up of fork, spoon and sticks was wrapped in a heavy paper nap with a rose printed on the right spot for the package to appear perfectly placed for casual elegance.  Nice touch. \n\nThe menu was bilingual so my companion had an easy time with descriptions and photo captions. She went quickly to the Spicy Crisp Intestine, and left the rest of the ordering to me.  Up for the challenge, I opted for the Szechuan Style Spicy Chicken (basically, salt/pepper dry pot chicken), and Spicy Eggplant in Garlic Sauce.  Wasn't in the mood for DanDan, Wonton, nor Mapo.  \n\nThey arrived in that sequence, with about 5 minutes between each delivery.  All were very good to excellent.  The Intestine was thin cut, lightly fried, and loaded with Red Chili, Scallions, Celery and Peanuts.  Good heat, but not a conflagration, as I did not see any Szechuan Black Peppercorns in the mix; thus no anesthetic effect.  It took you to the edge of the fire, burned your eyelashes, but did not throw you in.  \n\nThe Chicken dish was a variation of Salt/Pepper Dry Pot Style Chicken morsels, well dusted in a spicy ensemble, and flash fried twice so there was little oily residue.  Tender meat with more Red Chili, Peanuts, Scallions, and a sprinkling of Sesame Seed on top.  The heat quotient was perhaps a few degrees higher than the Intestines, with more spice during and after cooking.  Very tasty, but perhaps the weakest link in our dinner chain.  \n\nThe biggest and best surprise was the Eggplant.  It was sliced into lengths of a four/five inches, skinned, and somehow wok-ked to give a mild crispiness.  How did they do that? It was a neat trick, and it was piled high on a deep dish that created an island surrounded by red, shining, heat vapored, sauce.  The heart of the nightshade remained soft and contained a hint of sweetness.  This combo tag team between the Red Chili flame and unexpected sugar underneath was delicious and fun.  \n\nWe thoroughly enjoyed this repast.  If asked to compare with other hot houses in Ctown, it would fall somewhere just below Emei (across the street), on the same plane as Four Rivers and Spice C, and above Traditional Szechuan.  It really reminded me of the old Chili Szechuan on Baltimore Avenue, before it moved to larger digs and lost its edge.  \n\nGotta say that this block of Arch Street has it going on!\n\nHan Dynasty will just have to wait.",

    "text": "I have been fortunate not to know anyone inpatient at St. Mary Medical Center for many years, but I continue to come here periodically as part of my effort to maintain my health.  Their radiology department is still the nearest source of X-rays, CT Scans, MRI's, etc.  \n\nI was there again last week for a couple of scans requested by my family doctor.  The hospital itself has undergone a facelift over the past few years, and it shows.  The lobby is larger with more seating area, while the registration area is now out of sight.  The hall to radiology passes both a serenity garden with a glass wall for viewing, and the original cafeteria, which has always been a decent place for a bite.  \n\nI was in and out of the building in under an hour.  The check in was fast and courteous, and the lab technicians working with me were relaxed, yet professional.  They made the ordeal of passing through the CT Scanner as easy as possible, when required to remain still and hold your breath with arms overhead six times as the mobile bed slides through the huge spinning magnets. \n\nStill; no harm, no foul.  I walked out into the waning spring day feeling better about taking care of myself.  \n\nSt. Mary seems on top of its game for my purposes.",

    "text": "When Caf\u00e9 Ole, right down the street from Downtown Deli had a sign on the window saying that it was closed and for sale, I looked up Warren Street and saw that the Deli was open for business this overly warm November morning.  I asked the folks working out front whether they were serving breakfast, and received an affirmative reply.  \n\nSay no more. Just point me to the coffee.  \n\nI settled into a table on the raised balcony/dining area and in short order a friendly woman approached to ask what I wanted to eat.  I didn't need a menu and I asked for a Sausage, Egg and Cheese Sandwich on a Kaiser Roll.  She nodded and said that particular item was, \"...one of my specialties.\"  \n\nWell, all right!\n\nAnd, she was right.  Her creation arrived a few minutes later.  The Eggs were Scrambled, rather than Fried, and I found that I liked the overall texture and taste better that way.  The Sausage Patty was slightly crunchy on the edges, which was unusual.  I couldn't tell if it was done purposely or not, but it was another surprising plus.  The Roll was fresh and chewy with a light yeastiness.  Nice. \n\nThe Coffee was some unknown brand to me, but went down hot and smooth. \n\nPrices were lower than in the burgs, likely reflecting the lower rent paid in the core of this capitol city.  I made a mental note to keep Downtown Deli on the circuit for breakfast before court, and potentially, lunch, afterwards.",

Dog & Bull was one of those places in yesteryear, but is not THAT place any more.  That it is a way cool micro bar on the tracks next to the train station, is true, but what the owners have done with it brings it to another level of coziness and good grubbiness. \n\nIt is now a favorite watering hole for anyone looking for a cool place for a few drinks or a better than good lunch or dinner.  It is tiny.  But, they have a great number of crafts on draft, plus a menu that keeps you entertained.  So, even though I walked in thinking we would have a drink and conversation, we ended up sitting at a high top over dinner. The place is intriguing. \n\nWe both drank the hard Cherry Cider, a first for me, but likely not the last.  It was cool, mildly sweet, and oh, so, refreshing.  My Fried Chicken was done well with Mashed and lightly steamed String Beans.  It satisfied my recent addiction and it was interesting to see how different this dish could be from the standard KFC.  I did not taste my partners Salmon Wrap, but it was large and she stopped talking after she bit off the first chew.  Must have been good. \n\nBefore leaving, the live music began.  An acoustic set by a local artist whose first cover of a Neil Young classic was decent.  He was game, but playing at the back end of the barroom is not the best way to grab everyone's attention.  While his guitar and voice were amped, it was not so loud as to disturb anyone who wanted to continue conversing.  Nice touch.\n\nI really like what they've done to the place, and will return for more of the cool atmosphere, good drinks, and well produced bar/comfort food.",

It is a tiny place with entry around the back of the large red brick structure, requiring attention to signs on the street directing where it is hidden. Plenty of parking back there. \n\nThis family run breakfast, brunch & lunch joint has been going for 15 years, and the siblings certainly know how to work together. They are friendly and justly proud of what they do in the community. I sat at the six stool counter overlooking the small kitchen. Although a curtain separates customer view from flying spatula, the sounds of breakfast making are easily heard and entertaining. \n\nCoffee was decent, and my ask for milk over Mini Moos, graciously met. Unfortunately, it took too long to get a refill, as the curtain blocked the staff view of customers, and the floor person was obliviously attached to her phone. Yet, the short stack french toast was very good. Nice egg, vanilla and cinnamon mix for dipping, and good caramelization. \n\nOverall, Santangelo's is a strong find on the post industrial streets of Norristown. A little polish on customer service would elevate this earnest cafe to a higher level to match the quality of its menu.",

The abundant evidence hangs in the front window where ruby roasted pork and duck are displayed on hooks as savory invitations to come inside with strong appetite. \n\nThe dining room looks nicer than I recall from my last visit sometime in the last decade. Newer furniture now graces the house, and maybe even renovated floors and lighting. The place is still packed on weekends with people young and old eating their fill of the excellent meat kitchen up front and/or the soup and noodle possibilities in back. \n\nWe had a bit of both. We ordered congee with ancient egg and beef chow fun from the latter and a plate of roast pork and duck over rice from the former. Everything was good to great. The congee was thick and loaded with black hard boiled egg, morsels of pork and chive on top. So much better tasting than it sounds! The pork and duck dish was almost all meat, perfectly roasted to a dark ruby bark and only the slightest fat for extra flavor.\nThe chow fun was the weakest entre, as it seemed a touch overcooked without sufficient brown sauce to compensate. Still, the taste was there, it just needed more lubrication. \n\nWe liked our meal so much that we ordered half a duck and equal quantity of pork to take home. It was just as good tonight, two days later. \n\nTing Wong is a wonderful tradition in Philly Chinatown, with mostly great southeast China cuisine, great prices and a strong following. It is totally old fashioned. You would not want it any other way.",

Wasn't sure if 21 of those shiny boys would lift me off the ground or fit into my car, but I was going to find out. \n\nTurned out that this Family Dollar was Balloon Central HQ. Right above the cash register were a few hundred already inflated stars and flags in a multitude of colors, with drawers along the back wall with dozens of additional choices. A large tank of helium with special nozzle to fit the mouth of the balloon stood at the ready. \n\nThe shop wasn't crowded and the young cashier had time to pull out the red, silver and blue ones already floating above her, and then retrieve the Stars and Stripes from inventory and fill them from the tank. They were truly a buck each, despite the amount of work required to prepare them for me. She was efficient and friendly throughout. \n\nI managed to stuff all in my trunk and back seat without a loss, although that was all I saw in the rearview. \n\nThey looked great around the reception area after the ceremony today.

It will no doubt become a keystone of the new Village @ Newtown that Brixmor is developing. \n\nWe should hope that Nina understands Newtown history and its deep roots directly from William Penn's founding of his New Town in Bucks County, through its 88 years as the county seat, our central role during the Revolutionary War, and even the significant impact of anti-independence sentiment that tore the populis apart before final victory. In Newtown, it is ever more than selling ice cream. It is also about helping people see our story all around them. Nina's is in the unique position to do so with every lick. \n\nSo, yes. Their fresh, hot waffles taste great, and their proprietary ice cream recipes are sweet creamy delights, that measure well against the other milk churn outfits in town. Still, beyond the novelty, it will be known by how it contributes to the overall Newtown experience. \n\nWith so many new food outlets coming on line in their immediate vicinity, we can only hope that Nina has enough parking, that it survives the competition by taking full advantage of its special home, and that it calls on surrounding history as a big part of why it deserves our dollars.",

It is rustic with knotty pine barroom and dining area, and plenty of TVs for the sports contingent. Service is shared among all the floor people, who are collectively friendly and seem always on top of their game. \n\nWe ordered their signature Reuben on Rye and a Pepperjack Burger from their new large format menu. Sam Adams Winter draft and Coor's Light wet are whistles. $2.50 domestic drafts were greatly appreciated. We watched the Sixers take on the Hornets and end their losing streak by 8. (They really have to work on those turnovers!) \n\nBoth sammies were very good. The corned beef was sufficiently fatty to have plenty of taste, especially in the mix with melted swiss and Russian dressing pressed into toasted rye. The half pound slider had not been frozen and was served the requested medium finish, with Pepperjack adding some zing and straw onions a pleasant crunch. They had no problem subbing cole slaw for fries, although I sampled them on my beautiful companion's plate and they were crisp and nubby. \n\nThe only knock on the joint was the loudness of the bar, which circulated throughout due to poor acoustics. Made for challenging conversation at times. Aside from that Eddington House is a nice hangout for brew and bite in this part of Bucks County. \n\nQuality, pricing and service are all right.",

The row of windows up front let in a lot of light for a bright, colorful sense that helps accent the casual semi-tropical feel of the place.  The service is equally light and friendly.  \n\nHaving read here that the pho was not the strongest aspect of the house, we went in another direction.  We ordered Goi Cuon (Summer Rolls) as an app, with Pad Thai Shrimp and Com Thit Nuong (Broken Rice w/ BBQ Pork).  All were quite good. The Rolls were cool and crisp with a smooth Peanut Dipping Sauce.  The Pad Thai, while not the best ever, was a solid contributor with a good number of midsized shrimp and a mildly tangy sauce.  The Com dish offered a load of tasty Pork strips, Rice, and Pickled Veggies.  Each table had large bottles of Sriracha and Hoisin to use as needed to reach the desired personal taste of spice and heat. \n\nWe lingered after dinner to chat with our server about business and our time in Vietnam.  He was from HCMC and had been here only a year.  We were able to compare our experiences, and came away feeling very comfortable in his work home.\nWhatever may have been lacking in attaining haute cuisine status was compensated by the relaxed coziness of the shop and friendly interaction with the staff.  \n\nIt is a place I can return for an easy meal when in the area to shop the Asian markets.",

    "text": "Adams Avenue in Northeast Philadelphia is a center for the Vietnamese community. The neighborhood is full of pho and com (noodle & rice) houses that are about as authentic as you can find on the East Coast. No, it is not yet as diverse as Garden Grove, CA, with little differentiation between southern and northern style cuisine, but what they do have, they do well by and large. \n\nPho Ha Saigon benefits from being a fairly new structure; well designed and spacious enough (in a post industrial sort of way) to attract and hold your attention, with a respectable and capable kitchen. The service staff is generally bilingual and large enough to stay on top of their work. Their HVAC is strong enough to suck the front doors closed and create a semi-vacuum between them, making prying them open to enter or exit a chore. Hopefully, that also means there is sufficient circulation to be sucking out any Covid suspended in the air. \n\nI went with a smaller bowl of Pho Ga (Chicken Noodle Soup), Spring Rolls, and takeout for the family of Grilled Beef w Vermicelli, and Roast Pork/Beef Banh Mi). The bowl was still large enough for a few goldfish to swim comfortably. The chicken broth had very good flavor profile and there were plenty of accessories (Thai basil, sprouts, jalapeno slices, & lime wedge) to adapt to my tastebuds. The sliced breast meat was downright generous, and the under the surface nest of thin rice noodles, more than adequate. \n\nWhile the Spring Rolls were generic, with standard sweet dipping sauce, the pho was a pleasure to slurp with flat spoon in one hand and chopsticks in the other. It filled me completely. I suppose the broth could have been somewhat deeper in secondary seasoning and simmer time, because I found myself suffering a mild case of MSG poisoning on the way home. I am allergic to it, and I should have warned them when ordering. Still, MSG really shouldn't even be in their kitchen. Chalk it up to my oversight. I won't remove a star, but reserve the right to let people know in case they are also sensitive to it. \n\nThat evening my family went after the Banh Mi and Vermicelli dish with gusto. The sandwiches were stuffed and had great taste with strong roll contributions. The Grilled Beef was succulent and in small thin sliced pieces. Delicious. \n\nBut for my bout with the food additive, I totally enjoyed my meal at Pho Ha Saigon, and will not hesitate to return with memo to self about inquiring about MSG.",

Still, I found their willingness to fully engage the customer on the issues important to the phone/service buyer, ie., selecting a new phone, changing the SIM card from a foreign phone for use in the USA, selecting the right plan when five phones are involved, and working through all the set up requirements on the equipment (even in Chinese), was quite amazing. Props to Derek who went above and beyond the call in spending at least 90 minutes with us as we worked through these issues.  He never lost his cool, and remained open and inventive as one roadblock after another was deciphered and overcome.  \n\nThis wireless phone business is not easy for most of us, and we all know that it has become increasing expensive with every passing year.  It is almost as if the next step in this industry is for private consultants to begin to offer analysis of need and service availability across the spectrum of alternatives and point us in the right direction, if not complete the transactions for us, and get paid by the phone companies for bringing customers to them.  \n\nUntil that day arrives, it is fortunate we now have a local shop with knowledgeable and willing service folk who can at least provide that kind of insight for their own company's line of product and services.  We definitely felt that Derek was doing his best to listen to us, and respond with suitable alternatives.  \n\nThese circumstances are never \"Wahoo\" moments.

    "text": "Capital Health's new medical center in Hopewell, NJ, follows the trend in modern healthcare to merge the concepts of hospitals and hotels into a one stop shop for all medical needs, with a level of comfort and service that blurs the line between the two industries. Thinking of it as a hotel providing for health needs is probably accurate. \n\nThis is both good and bad. No one complains when a facility is clean, well staffed and meets the needs of everyone walking through the front door. The menu of services is extensive, with well trained professionals all around. Yet, the cost associated with these offerings can be excessive, and even with some insurance, beyond the financial means of most people. Those insurers have become more severe in their rejection of most invoices, realizing they are being asked to pay for a level of comfort for patients and visitors previously unavailable. What do you do when the hospital provides only private rooms and your carrier contracted with you to pay only a percentage of the semi-private rate? You hope you aren't admitted. \n\nThe level of specialization in each sub-discipline means a higher trained doctor is at your call, but while that is critical for some conditions, it is not for others. Still, the expense of over treatment is spread among all the patients without notice, nor consultation. \n\nPart of this built in excess is due to how medical centers are developed, and the amazing tax advantages a health facility developer has over regular commercial work. The developer makes its money as the construction is done, while the management arm of the business can only expect pay as you go. Medicare, Medicaid and private insurers continually cut their portion of the bills to be paid, while the price tag on the service constantly goes higher. No wonder even the wealthy fear unanticipated medical expenses. \n\nSo, you have to hope the best medicine is available when needed, but also understand the cost of readiness and proximity may break your budget.",

A lot of money and attention to detail went in to the makeover of the bar, although the dining rooms with the large windows facing the Delaware appear about the same. It remains a well appointed house designed for higher end dining and drinking in this historic river city. \n\nI stopped in for an early breakfast last weekend.  Sitting at the bar, I appreciated the comfortable opulence of the thick dark stone bar top and the mirrored back bar holding a multitude of bottles of whiskey, tequila, brandy, and other libations. There was one other customer there waiting for a takeout order, and only a few tables occupied in the other room. 8:30 am was the perfect time to settle in and find out what the kitchen could do. The clipboard menu looked good, and I opted for their version of a croissant filled with sausage, egg and cheese, with the complementary side of home fried taters. Excellent strong java came first to further open my eyes to the coming day. \n\nService came directly from management, with an assist from an English-accented young woman, both of whom were friendly and willing to provide information about the operation opened less than one year. The meal was very good - everything fresh and cooked just for me. Thoroughly enjoyed it.  Special mention to the home fries, which were large chunks, well seasoned with taste and texture that had me devouring more than I should. The java seemed likewise freshly roasted, with a pleasant aftertaste that is often lost when the grounds age for a few days. \n\nI will return for a romantic dinner sometime soon, to see how everything holds up after dark.

The small breakfast menu led us directly to their sandwiches. One based in lamb sausage for me, and in grilled ham for my beautiful companion. Fried egg. Melted cheese. Cut fruit and home fries (extra) completed the plates. \n\nThe \"#3\" sandwich stuffed into a toasted & buttered brioche-style roll; Lamb Sausage, Feta Cheese, Roasted Tomato, Grilled Onion and Fried Egg.  The meat appeared to be thinly sliced to provide more savory flavor.  All the parts played well together, but the Feta and Lamb were major elements, while the Egg, Onion and Tomato were minor scale.  Very tasty, especially when \"animalizing\" it by throwing the Home Fries into the fray and pressing down. \n\n\"#2\" exchanged Country Ham, American Cheese and Herb Mayo for the strong parts of the above, and put them into a traditional Kaiser Roll.  Its statement was more reserved, but a solid chew and swallow.  The taters added some greasy zest. \n\nThere is more to the offerings at lunch and dinner.  Local sourcing is a priority.  The La Colombe coffee was strong and flowing freely.  If country atmosphere is part of your delight, Chive Caf\u00e9 provides it is copious quantities.  Definitely worth another look later in the day.",

    "text": "I haven't updated this review since Dragon of Newtown moved to Swamp Road a few years ago.\n\nThe menu hasn't changed much, but the size of the restaurant has shrunk to fit in an appropriately smaller space retained from the years as Meglio's. It appears better organized and more tidy than before. Service remains friendly and attentive, and Philomena is still the empress overseeing the operation. \n\nAlthough I am occasional there for dinner, lunch is my regular beat. Their combination specials are a few bucks higher than other Chinese houses, but by comparison the quality is higher than most. The wonton soup has a pleasant consomme base stock and the wontons are thin skinned and stuffed with a good ground pork filling. I normally request Orange Beef (fried rice, broccoli, comes with). The sauce is tart with slivers of orange peel, and appears to be made to order, rather than the time stamped heavy gloop offered elsewhere. Decent tea flows freely. \n\nFor a local dine in/take out, Dragon is a way better than average option among Chinese American kitchens. They are really making an effort to appeal to the pallette as well as the wallet.",

    "text": "DJ Kitchen offers Szechuan cuisine on City Line Avenue, Philadelphia. \n\nWell, sort of. \n\nIt has the red Szechuan peppers down in large quantities, and many other hot spices that bring the willing cognizant diner to the brink of tongue burning ecstasy. Yet, like most other Chengdu facsimiles around town, it stops short of the authentic 'flavor of numb' brought on by only the traditional black peppercorns and star peppers that grow in the hot humidity of the ancient Du plains in the plateau region of the central and western parts of the province. \n\nWithout the Numb, it just isn't true Szechuan. It is still quite good, with quality ingredients and plenty of meat, veggies, spices and sesame oils, but it isn't the Full Monty. The portions are substantial with leftovers for the boys at home. \n\nWe thoroughly enjoyed the Cumin Lamb and Long Hots with Beef. They were colorful with powerful aromas. The meat was tender while the peppers and onions, crisp. The red onion was particularly sweet in contradistinction to the growling bark of the green long hots. Both damn good. The only shortcoming beside the absence of numbing essence, was the saltiness of the Dry Pepper Crispy Chicken. It was an unnecessary distraction to an otherwise entertaining platter. \n\nWe enjoyed chatting with Ming, one of the owner/managers, who took time to explain some of the history of the restaurant. He and his partners have created an interesting haven for those seeking an alternative to the regular Chinese American grub, and although it doesn't travel all the way to to the numbing mountaintops, it does take us a long way up that winding spicy road.",

    "text": "Carlos Garcia seems to have a thriving pizzeria business with the recent opening of his fourth parlor in Morrisville, PA. They are all enumerated after his daughter, Camila. I haven't met her, but it is obvious her father takes great pride in her and the success of the enterprise. \n\nThe location is in a small strip center, replacing an earlier pizza/pasta joint that succumbed in the midst of COVID-19 last year (RIP). It is apparent that they have worked hard to freshen up the space with colorful wall murals and end to end cleaning. The people there are friendly and have skills, although the older dude folding boxes in front of the counter couldn't manage to make eye contact. Maybe a language problem. \n\nSo, I ordered by phone rather than GrubHub, to keep the money in their register rather than sharing with a third party. I went with a large pie, half sausage and penne aglio olio with spinach (which came with side salad and small loaf of oven fresh bread). \n\nThe pizza was good, with firm crust and scorch marks across the bottom. The slices held their point when lifted and folded for eating. As they cooled that rigidity waned and dog eared. The crumbled sweet sausage was plentiful, but a bit salty. The other half of the pie was plain, and probably would have been better with a tad less cheese, so the flavor of the tomato sauce and basil could shine through. \n\nThe pasta was not listed on the menu, and I suspected they didn't regularly indulge such preferences. Still, there was plenty of garlic and good taste. Having had the same dish at a different place last week that was over the top with whole fresh spinach leaves sauteed perfectly, this version was light on the finely chopped greens. I won't downgrade as the chef was doing me a favor and may not have had exactly what he needed for the optimal dish. I appreciated the effort. \n\nOverall, quite decent for a neighborhood Casa Italiana Mexicana. \n\n3.5 STARS",

    "text": "I always feel a bit out of my element when invited to a good steakhouse like Capital Grille in King of Prussia. Not a steak lover, I can appreciate the clubby atmosphere, the dark wood tones, and white jacketed servers always where they should be, attentively taking care of their beef obsessed customers. I even love the aroma of grilled sirloin and the menacing glitter of oversized serrated knives slicing through medium rare filet mignon. For me, the odor is the best part. \n\nSo, I ready my excuses for not joining in the carnivorial feast, yet always manage to find plenty of good things to enjoy on the menu outside of the main attraction. Nobody really minds that I am the guy who goes with calamari, wedge or Caesar salad and a tapas approach to the many veggie sides available. Give me interesting brussel sprouts, cauliflower or roast/mashed potato, and I go to town. \n\nCapital Grille does everything well, and the servers are always on their game. The New England Clam Chowder, Wedge Salad and large plate of calamari (tentacles included) were all tasty and left me full even without the heavier meat load. \n\nI mused as I worked through my choices, watching my office compadres cut bloody paths through their perfectly finished steaks and chops. I knew we were appreciated by the powers that be to be treated so well.",

For too long this area has been struggling to attract customers. The best way to make a commercial zone less sketchy is to provide activities that can be enjoyed with the family. Good and entertaining food is part of the equation. Poke Ocean while not a home run, it a solid contributor with its sushi/poke/udon/teriyaki orientation. Three other food outlets are under construction as I write. \n\nThe floorplan looks alot like the previous BBQ joint that ran out of steam last year. It is just cleaned up a bit. Service is cordial and efficient with the right Asian flair. Lunch is served from 11 to 3, although there does not appear to be a poke list discounted for lunch, making the other parts of the afternoon offerings the more appealing. I asked for the salmon teriyaki lunch which included miso soup, iceberg ginger goop salad, white rice and a nice salmon filet over sauteed onion and carrot slivers. The amber sauce was quite good. Additionally, I received a complimentary fried veggie roll, which I liked. \n\nThe lunch was good, although I really don't get the attachment to the iceberg salad, found in every sushitorium in the country. It is all water with that thick orange ginger dressing. Without nutritional value, I would prefer a different option with a more interesting taste/texture profile. How about edamame? \n\n3.5 STARS",

    "text": "I remember when Antonio's was just a good pizza joint on Trenton Avenue in Morrisville, Pa., just over the Calhoun Street Bridge from Trenton.  My fondest memory was eating there while waiting for oral argument in the New Jersey Supreme Court.  We won that case, so I always associate this restaurant with success.  Now, it is an \"Italian Bistro,\" and has become an upscale stop for folks who like good Italian food but don't want to travel far to get it.  \n\nI sat in the base of the tower last Sunday night.  I had been jonezing for a good aglio olio, and the Caf\u00e9 delivered.  My Cavatelli Siciliani came nicely plated in a deep soup bowl, complete with Sweet Italian Sausage, Broccoli Rabe, lots of browned Garlic and topped with Romano Cheese.  Although there was a fair amount of olive oil in water at the bottom of the dish, it did not diminish the full flavor of the ingredients.  I enjoyed it.  \n\nIt came with a full loaf of in house baked bread, and a Green Salad with Balsamic.  The bread tasted like pizza dough (which it was), and was unnecessary calories.  The Salad was a fair mix of Lettuces, Tomato, Red Onion, Carrot.  Nothing creative, but a solid veggie accompaniment.  \n\nService was fine with several servers in black stopping by regularly to refill my water glass and be sure I was satisfied.  Aside from it being a bit too cool for me in a T shirt, the experience was very good. \n\nComing at $15.99, the price was about right, but it would have been a true deal had it been a buck or two less.  \n\nParking was not an issue Sunday night, but it is a small lot, which is likely trouble for a busy lunch hour or prime time dinner reservation. \n\nCaf\u00e9 Antonio is all grown up!",

    "text": "Cosmos on Trenton Road in Fairless Hills is a fairly big place, equally divided between restaurant and bar.  My time was spent in the watering hole, which has a large rectangular bar with a few dozen stools, and is surrounded by HDTVs high on the walls for a good view of whatever sportage is being shown.  The bartenders are friendly and knowledgeable, and very accustomed to people eating while they imbibe.  \n\nAs it was my first visit, I opted for their Fire Apple beverage and a bowl of French Onion Soup.  Both were scalding in their own way.  The drink was a combination of Angry Orchard Hard Apple Cider and Fireball Whiskey.  Fireball is a cinnamon-based fermentation, and its flavor goes very well with the hard apple.  It was challenging to just sip it in its large beer glass, as the natural inclination was to take large gulps as I would for straight brew.  Alas, that was not a wise move, as the whiskey's bite clawed at my throat on first swallow, nearly causing me to cough.  A quick learner, I adjusted and thoroughly enjoyed the cool apple crispness with cinnamon kick the rest of the way.  And, yes, I was able to walk away when done.  \n\nPerhaps, the balance came from the very good bowl of L'Oignon Gratinee.  The beef broth was completely sealed by the melted Gruyere, and when opened with spoon, the steam rushed out like a volcanic vent.  Probing, I encountered a load of translucent onions, chunks of thick bread, and slightly oily-sheened beef broth.  It was tasty and savory, and played very well with the cool cinnamon appleness of the Fire Apple.  I had stumbled on a good combination of flavors, textures and temperatures.  \n\nThe \"cocktail\" came in at $8.50, and the potage at about five bucks.  Definitely a nice place to hang out on a midweek evening while exploring both the bar and kitchen menus. \n\nSee ya soon!",

    "text": "A party of seven can be a challenge for a popular and busy restaurant, especially when six of the guests have never eaten Italian food before.  Confusion, questions, blank stares.  But, when lucky enough to be handed off to a seasoned professional wait person, what might have been an eye-rolling chore, becomes an interesting and entertaining part of the evening.  \n\nSo it was at Carlucci's Grill in the Lower Makefield shopping center that is anchored by Kohl's Department Store at the corner of Oxford Valley and Big Oak Roads.  I was given the responsibility of ordering for everyone, so after studying the menu I decided to stick with the classics, so everyone would discover what Italiano was all about for the most people.  Parmigianas for everyone, except for the more adventurous who opted for Carlucci's \"Princess\" finish to chicken and shrimp.  Standard sides of pasta with red sauce, except for the aglio olio linguini I preferred.  \n\nGotta give kudos to our main man in black & white, and the kitchen.  The feast began with a puff bread with an olive oil garlic drip.  Never had that before, and it was very good fun to rip apart and devour.  The accompanying salads all had balsamic dressing, and were solid, if not exceptional.  We finally arrived at the entrees.  Large plates of veal, chicken and shrimp or eggplant, covered in red gravy and melted mozza or cream sauce (Princess), and sharing space with an ample load of al dente linguini, were placed before us.  \n\nWe all fell silent as we dove in.  The veal was fine, thin sliced and saut\u00e9ed before dosing in ample thick and chunky gravy, with just enough cheese cover to allow the dueling colors to swirl without sealing the meat within.  Nice chew, better swallow. The eggplant could have been more tender, probably due to the thickness of the slices and not enough time in the fry pan to really soften the large circumference of the purple beast.  Still, a credible job.  The pasta sides were average. \n\nCarlucci's is BYOB, so we consumed Pinot Grigio and Corona in sufficient quantities to keep everyone lose and engaged.  Most importantly, we gave our guests something to talk about after returning to Asia.  \n\nThis is what Marco Polo had in mind as he returned to Venice on the Silk Road with his first shipment of rice and noodles.  He could not have fully realized what he was starting.  The Carlucci's have certainly carried the traditions that evolved from the Court of the Great Kublai Khan to us in competent hands.",

    "text": "Another of the growing cadre of very good Mexican restaurants in and around Trenton.  This one, El Potrillo (The Colt) has taken over Marsilio's Kitchen on Roebling Avenue in the Burg.  It is amazing how Mexican rugs thrown over tables change the look and mood of one of the classic Italian houses.  One can only hope they can do something that is the Mexican equivalent of the great Chicken Cacciatore that its predecessor was known for. \n\nThe space is casual, but also clean and well organized.  The bar is no longer servicing alcohol, but in its place are fresh squeezed fruit/vegetable juices.  My large snifter of Carrot Juice was sweet and coolly refreshing.  The menu is diverse and provides just enough English to hint at what you will get.  \n\nMy Torta Carnitas (slow cooked pork) was huge and enough for 2 meals.  The Roll was thin and nicely crunchy.  There was plenty of meat at the bottom and it was the base for the Lettuce, Avocado, Onion, Jalapeno, Fresh Cheese, Tomato and Spicy Mayo that all came wrapped neatly in paper.  I needed knife and fork to work my way through the half torta, taking the other piece home for another lunch.  \n\nThe combination of fresh veggie juice ($4) and the torta ($8), may seem steep for this type of shop, but when you realize they are preparing two meals for you, the value proposition becomes outstanding.  \n\nEl Portrillo asks if \"You have tried the best Mexican food around?\" \n\nThey are certainly entitled to their hyperbole, because it is among the best I have sampled in Trenton.",

    "text": "The Borough Pub on Farragut Avenue, Bristol, PA, is a pleasant joint to stop for a beer or two, and a light bite if hungry. Although it is located on a fairly forlorn stretch of old Bristol Borough, the inside is a cozy knotty pine paneled long room with rectangular bar up front, and dining room/kitchen farther back. Prices are appropriate for the neighborhood, and there is a decent brewlist for those who enjoy a long draught of pilsner. They currently have a Yelp check in bonus of a domestic draft (not a crafty). I had a light beer with my meal. \n\nSon and I stopped in for dinner recently for the first time, and were impressed. The space was well maintained, the staff friendly, chatty and accommodating; and the kitchen better than expected. I went with a small bowl of French Onion Soup and their \"Pubrogies,\" a version of the popular Polish dough pockets stuffed with mashed potatoes, and covered in a nice mix of saut\u00e9ed onions, green peppers and jalapeno, with a large dollop of sour cream on top of it all. Son with younger and larger appetite, ordered the Cheesesteak Spring Rolls and Honey Chipotle Pulled Pork (Chipotle sauced shredded pork with melted pepper jack, on a jalapeno cheddar brioche bun). \n\nEverything was good to nearly great. The soup, perhaps the weakest link, had the right savoriness, but lacked the crusty bread and load of wine soaked onions of the original recipe from Les Halles. The \"rogies,\" were tasty with a nice kick from the hot pepper, and balanced well against the inner mashed. The spring rolls were larger than anticipated, crisp and crammed with beef, cheese, onions and peppers. A kicky ketchup came along for the ride for dipping. The pulled pork was devoured by son (didn't offer me a bite) - always an indication that he was enthralled and unwilling to share. Glad he liked it so much. \n\nOur server, Dawn, had a great attitude. Around just enough to keep everything refilled and moving, with a sense of humor and bonhomie. \n\nBorough Pub is a place to relax, sip and chew in an atmosphere that is both family and sporty. It doesn't take itself too seriously, and as a result, it is a cool place to kick back and catch some sports and conversation with people you enjoy.",

The menu is primarily American classics, with a large sandwich page and multi component entrees for those desiring a bigger meal. \n\nI sat in the step down barroom that felt like a basement with low ceiling and large rectangular bar. I didn't see the dining room. My server was prompt and friendly, bringing the draft Stella Artois to me in seconds. My plan was to have an early solo dinner while the family worked into the evening, and to bring home food for them so they had something interesting to eat when they arrived.\n\nThe chips & salsa table nosh was a nice touch. \n\nI liked the homemade meatloaf dinner that came with mashed potatoes and fresh steamed zucchini. It was def a step up from a burger, with texture and flavor coming in part from the dark brown gravy on top. Washed it all down with the cold Stella. \n\nI ordered the Brisket and Cuban Sandwiches and their Original Burger (grass fed locally w cheese, grilled onions and avocado) as takeout for the fam. Later that night I tasted the brisket on brioche and it was quite tender with a nice almost sweet BBQ bite. The Cuban disappeared without an offer from the stepson, while the burger was devoured by son after the rest of us went to bed. Told me he liked it, with special mention of the creamy avo adding interest when I saw him in the morning. \n\nOverall, although labeled as a roadhouse tavern, Hawkeye's felt like a family restaurant (although I didn't see any kids). It did a very good job with the cuisine standards, and with a better curated brewery component and deeper whiskey shelf, it could attract a more rousing crowd and rock out.",

    "text": "As many reviews of Parkview Cafe explain, this place is difficult to find in the back of an industrial park off Horsham Road, and without a sign to let you know you are close. But, if you follow the GPS into the park, you will eventually see a green awning that lets you know you have arrived. Park the car, and walk along the walkway until you reach the front door. \n\nInside, you find a traditional looking luncheonette dining room with tables along a wall of windows, and a smaller room separated by a half wall from the main space. Everything is a simple comfort. The menu is limited to breakfast and lunch, and the morning I was there, one server for the operation, unless someone came out of the kitchen to assist with ordertaking and delivery. So, best to sit back and adjust to a slower pace. \n\nI made my own omelet of three eggs, onion, pepper, tomato, feta cheese, and asked for it \"country style,\" with the homefries inside the egg case. Twenty minutes and half a mug of coffee later, it was placed before me, with straight edges and two stacks of half moon rye toast alongside. The Valentina Mexican Hot Sauce splashed on top added a desirable bite. \n\nAside from being a tad bit dry in spots from overcooking on the hot steel, it was a good dish and quite filling. The buttered toast offset the spice, and the java washdown was satisfyingly bracing. A solid breakfast, but if I had been in a hurry, I would have found it almost unbearably slow. Because I wasn't, I can mention it without heavy markdown, and hope that a word to the wise is sufficient. \n\nThe only \"Parkview\" seen from the cafe is the vista of surrounding aluminum warehouses and light industrial structures with minimalist shrubery. Once I figured out that someone here had a deep sense of irony, I enjoyed the insight with a smile and tip of my cap to the desert dry humor.",

    "text": "The only Irish Sports Pub in Newtown, The Green Parrot, named for a 19th Century saloon of the same name that thrived at the other end of Sycamore Street and had a less savory reputation, has become the anchor of the new Goodnoe Corner commercial center that is the heart of Newtown Township.  If you want to catch World Cup action, this is the only local place to belly up to the bar and see it live at 6 in the morning.  It is also the centerpiece of all the street action fairs, shows and other events that occur in this fair burg. \n\nIf you enjoy loud bars with a couple of dozen HDTVs on the walls and winsome bartenders pouring your crafties, this be your place.  It has a rotating beer list that is bound to have something that appeals.  The kitchen is strong in the apps department, and grills up good burgers (starting at $10), but the dinners can be spotty, so for the price I tend to look elsewhere to sup. \n\nStill, I am a fan for what The Green Parrot does well, and for its active role in the life of our community.  Plenty of parking behind the house, and on the street.  Entrances front and rear. Nice covered porch which works well for private parties.",

    "text": "After gorging @ Mood Caf\u00e9 and wishing it had a lounge to push away from the table and offer time to digest, I realized the only alternative was a strong dose of caffeine if I was to make it home alert enough to dodge all the gaping potholes between West Philly and Bucks County. \n\n Perhaps it was Devine Intervention, but as I turned the corner onto 47th Street, I saw the bright red neon of the Vietnam Caf\u00e9.  The image of a big glass of Vietnamese Coffee filled my head, giving me an immediate jolt of anticipation.  My parking angel was also accommodating; providing a space almost right in front of its door.  I uplifted a smile in gratitude. \n\nWalking in, it was apparent that design and expense were put into the space.  It was very pleasant with many windows, attractive lighting, cozy tables, and a nice bar.  That was where I headed after advising the host/manager/owner that I was only interested in coffee.  The place was not crowded for a Saturday night, and there were a few empties at the bar.  The gracious gentleman did not skip a beat, and welcomed me to take a seat and he would see to the coffee.  Moments later, he was behind the bar, depositing my personal drip stainless steel press in front of me.  It sat on top of a thick cocktail glass with a half inch of Condensed Milk at the bottom.  I watched the dense brown colloid infuse the Milk, drip by drip.  I had time to take out my phone and check with Yelp about the place.  I learned that I had been in its sister ship, Vietnam on 11th \nStreet, in the past.  This made sense, given the attention to detail not often found in VN joints.  I also perused the menu, wishing I was hungry enough for a Banh Mi and a Com dish.  \n\nThe coffee hit the spot and I decided to indulge with a Spring Roll to be a good sport.  It arrived precut and with a rich sweet/spicy sauce.  It was fried, a small surprise, but quite good.  I was in and out in about 45, deciding that I would definitely return for a full repast to show my appreciation for the graciousness extended, and the karmic smile bestowed.",

    "text": "With an hour to wait before I was due back in court, I drove down High Street looking for a place to hang out over coffee.  \n\nI found that place with YelpHelp at the Mugshot Diner.  This is a corner establishment in the heart of downtown Mt. Holly.  It does not look like a traditional diner until you go inside.  Once the door closes behind you, all the cues are visible.  The counter with a half dozen high back stools; the booths along the walls, and the very friendly server slinging hash, Joe, and worldly wisdom to all who listen.  Of course, the mug shots are there, too.  Everyone from Frank Sinatra to Elvis hangs from the wall.  The multitude of bail bondsmen on the street close on the county courthouse explain why this name was chosen.  \n\nI ordered a Corn Muffin and Java and had time to talk with the waitperson, who happened to also be the owner of the business.  She was energetic and took pride explaining how she and her spouse had brought this business back to life after the original owner of the property had \"bailed\" on food here and taken the concept to Philly and other locales.  The caf\u00e9 that had been here for a couple of years ultimately failed, and these good folk approached him about reincarnating the Mugshot.  The rest is current events.\n\nMy Corn Muffin was much better than average, remaining moist and mildly sweet even after grilling.  It was also larger than what I had sampled in other similar food outlets.  The coffee was strong and there was no hesitation when I asked to swap out the half and half for regular milk.  \n\nThere are a few very good breakfast/lunch houses sprouting up in Mt. Holly lately, and Mugshot Diner is one of them.  I will be visiting again when I find myself with time on my hands in historic Mt. Holly.",

    "text": "When I came into Nifty Fifty's for the first time today my first impression was that the joint was almost empty at 2:30, and a far cry from the description of bedlam read in some reviews. Okay. That was a good thing, although I noticed the sign out front said something about being a \"Family Fun Restaurant,\" with mini golf and an arcade. I hoped that that the victuals would still be as good as Yelped. \n\nClearly, NF's is more about the shakes and hand made soda concoctions than the burgers.  After all, you get a choice of more than 100 shake flavors, while the burgers menu is really rather small. Single, double or triple, with/without cheese, shrooms, onions, lettuce, mayo, etc.  Not even a jalapeno option.  The fries and onion rings sounded more exciting than the slider selections. \n\nAll this evidence became manifest shortly after I ordered the black cherry shake first, and then the single burger with, and mushrooms and fried (not sauteed) onions, and the onion rings.  The burger and rings came out in separate red plastic baskets, while the shake was overflowing its large aluminum container in which it was spun in the blender.  I looked at the feast before me.  Shake, rings, burger in that order of visual stimulation.  I grabbed a few extra napkins as the shake began to run down the sides of the container, leaving a path through the condensation. \n\nThe shake was just incredible.  Intense black cherry flavored, thick, sweet, creamy. I started to fade back to about 1954 (Yes. I was a kid then) and relived the wonder sensation of a DQ Blizzard.  A pleasure zone in my cortex was triggered and I silently convulsed with joy.  It was way to much for me, and I took half of it home.  The onion rings were extra large, and breaded with a mix of spices and bread crumbs that made the crunchy bites delicious.  The burger became an afterthought.  It was decent with adequate grease, diaphanous onions and canned shrooms, to satisfy my basic burger lust, but not up to the standards of 5 Guys, Jake's Wayback, nor In N Out. The single seemed smallish. The bun undistinguished, and the ketchup shot from an overused red plastic counter rocket. The bun collapsed under the oily weight of the topping and I had to retreat to a knife and fork.\n\nSure. I will go again.  The overall experience was fun and the meal had some major positives (the shake and rings), that overcame the rather lethargic effort at a good burger.  I obviously picked the right time to go, as I sat alone at the counter and had the friendly waitress to myself.  I enjoyed the meal in peace.",

But, at this Philly Soft Pretzel Factory, not only are the pretzels bagged while hot, but the workers there genuinely smile and have fun taking care of you.  \n\nWe picked up 10 standard sized bowties, although we had the choice of minis, and singular chubby nubs.  During our interaction, they described how to use them as sandwich ends by slicing and even grilling before loading with our favorite contents.  Never thought to use them at home that way, but liked the idea.  \n\nI never believed a one item business would be successful in the long run, but these folks have been ongoing for more than ten years.

    "text": "Now that my office is in the area I have the opportunity to find and try a whole new world of food outlets.  One of my weekly staples is good pizza, and being so close to Trenton, tomato pie is practically on every corner.  \n\nDivine Pizza attracted me to its name as it was different than all the standard Tony's, DeLo's and other family named shops that abound.  Could be the name was Divino in the old world, but my first reaction was that they were trying to make a statement about their product being heavenly, or at least aspiring to be.  It's located in a mini strip commercial structure on Arena Drive with a Dairy Queen as the anchor tenant.  That was a good sign.  Built in dessert.  \n\nWalking in I noticed that this was a side by side orientation, with the dining room next to the kitchen/take out area, rather than front and back.  The dining area was not too big, and the tables had a nice black and wood top surface.  The menu was presented in a small bound book that covered everything for lunch and dinner.  Again, slightly different than most joints.  The radio was playing quiet rock; another pleasant distinction.  \n\nI went with the regular double slice of pie.  When it arrived a few minutes later I observed that the shape was almost equilateral, with narrow circumference  crust.  Picking up one it was quite firm, and held its point high without the hint of bowing.  First bite discovered a very firm undercarriage that demanded a purposeful clenching of the jaw to break through.  Very nice.  A peek under the hood showed the scorching of dough from a very hot oven.  The black streaks were just enough to demonstrate no fear of under baking, nor reheating.  It stood up to the challenge.  \n\nFinally, the chew and taste were purposeful and a little complex.  It was both salty and sweet, with the sweetness coming from the tomato and the saltiness from the crusty bottom.  They played very well together.  \n\nI liked this pizza much more than anticipated, and realized that there were many elements of the experience from the first moment that foreshadowed a good tomato pie.  Divine Pizza may not extend to the heavens, but it turned out a very enjoyable slice.  Given this introduction, I will certainly find my way back to see what else they can do that is better than expected.  \n\nDivine Pizza may yet be Dante's best work.",

    "text": "Xi'an Sizzling Woks does its namesake food very well.  As others have commented, stick to their Chef Recommendation and House Special menu and you will have a unique and enjoyable meal.  The farther you wander from Xi'an, the more the cuisine slides toward the norm, and becomes like most other shops in the area.  Best to stay on the Silk Road from beginning to end. \n\nMy experience last week proves the point.  We ordered Dumpling in Chili Sauce (Szechuan), Xi'an Liang Pi (Cold Mild Spice Noodles), Biang Biang Noodles w/ Ginger Scallion Sauce (Rave), and Spicy Pot Flavor Fish Fillet (Surprise Star of the Show). \n\nThe Dumplings were the weak link in our meal.  The skin was thicker than in a true Szechuan house, and the ground pork while plentiful, did not exhibit much flavor.  The Chili Sauce was not nearly hot enough.  We were sorry we wasted stomach space on something so mediocre.  \n\nThe Xi'an Liang Pi was a fettuccini width cold noodle bathed in a semi-hot sauce with Tofu, Shoots, and a few things I could not identify.  It was good and renewed our faith that the rest of the meal would be deliciously distinct.  \n\nWe moved on to the Biang Biang Noodles in Ginger Scallion Sauce.  As you have already read everywhere on this page, these Biang Biang are Bangin!  Our server stirred the bowl for us to be sure the sauce coated as much of the pasta as possible.  These hand cut bad boys were longer than a foot, and required high end dexterity to lift them high enough to clear the pile in the dish, maneuver them over to the small plate and then work the chop sticks to your lips well enough to take hold of the noodle and suck it into your mouth. Slurpy mess, but well worth the effort, as these were terrific due to the play of ginger, scallion and cumin (I think) on the tongue.  Subtle heat that grew slowly, but never approach the scalding of a Szechuan chili dish.  The noodles were firm and chewy and filling. \n\nWe would have called the night a great success if we had stopped there, but the urge to try something more brought us to the Spicy Pot Fish Fillets.  These tender morsels of fluke were crisp on the raised texture of each fillet, and included veggies and mushrooms is a wonderful red/orange sauce that also packed a punch, but more gently than, say, Emai across the street.  I loved this dish, and will try the other variations with beef, chicken, lamb and pork intestine in the future. \n\nXi'an Sizzling Woks is a smallish shop with no more than a dozen tables.  Best to get there early or late to avoid a wait.  It represents the style and cooking of this very old city that was once the capital of a Chinese Dynasty, and is now an industrial and university town, exceedingly well. It is certainly worth a visit (both city and restaurant).  It could easily become a regular stop on my Chinatown cruise.",

I do remember this being Kris Krois, a deep blue seafood joint that I enjoyed a couple of times.  Times change.  Now we have a nice large rectangular bar with back dining room that pours national and local suds and an abbreviated short order menu for those so inclined.  Specials every night of the week.  \n\nThis is a neighborhood bar looking for neighbors on this forlorn stretch of Rt. 1 in Fairless.  Only 5 people here when I walked in around 7:30 pm.  The friendly barkeep approached with a smile, and when I said this was my first time, she promptly gave me the quick tour of drinkables, and handed off their menus to examine.  My Sam Adams Winter Lager was perfect for a cold night, and had I been hungry, a few of the snacks looks appealing and very well priced.  \n\nThe HDTVs were channeling plenty of sports, and the other guys were engaged in conversation about industrial cooking.  Apparently, they worked at different assisted living facilities, and had tales to tell.  I eavesdropped now and then, as one of the homes was in my town.  Good to know the inside poop.  \n\nMy 45 minutes went fast. I paid and promised to return on a Monday for their wing night.  No one seemed to hear me, except the nice bartender, who said she would be waiting.  \n\nCool!",

    "text": "I am a Bristol fan. \n\nWhen I see something worth applauding on Mill Street I want a review with a marching band.  So, when Caf\u00e9 Bombay came to my attention I had to visit ASAP.  Last night was the night. I drove down with two mystery munchers and entered just after 7 per our reservation.  We were the only patrons, which was a bit disconcerting, but we grabbed the table in front to have the best view of the world going by, and be farthest from the kitchen.  The turmeric in the air was so palpable that we all were sneezing within minutes.  At least we knew the Masala Sauce would be dynamic. \n\nFor apps, we order 1.5 orders of Veggie Samosa.  We were pleased that half orders (1 samosa) were viable, as we only were three, and wanted to save space for later. The Sams were excellent with soft potato and hard peas.  NIce.  Our entrees consisted of Kerala Chicken Curry, traditional dish; Chicken Xacutti, Roasted Coconut was the most noticeable spice;  and Navarathan Korma, veggies, cheese, nuts & herbs.  All the gravies were creamy and packed a punch.  Given that we had to find a common denominator of heat, the range chosen was between 6 and 8, and all tasted, \"just right.\"  Additionally, we had Bombay Naan, a sweet version of the classic Indian Oven baked bread, with Almonds, Raisins, Ginger and Coconut; a perfect balance to the spicy heat coming from the main courses.  All these were first class.\n\nThe Mango Lassi while good, was undersized for the price of $3.50.  We were suggested to try a slice of Coconut Ice Cream Pie for dessert.  A first for me, it was pleasing like a cold Key Lime Pie, but a questionable purchase at $4.99.  \n\nCaf\u00e9 Bombay is definitely worth another visit as the menu hides other treasures.  Still, in an attempt to learn the lesson here, I would skip the lassi and dessert, and stay with the variety of main courses and regional specialties listed on the menu.  \n\nOne other oddity is that the online website menu does not list prices to permit changing market conditions.  That is a situation that should be easily remedied with a host changing the prices as necessary.",

    "text": "Seventh Heaven!\n\nIf they say it, it must be true.\n\nBack in the Day downtown Trenton was a hotbed of cuisinery delights. So, it comes as a somewhat pathetic reality to acknowledge that there is at least one such institution there now.  Where once you could choose among very good Italian, Greek, Diner, Seafood, Soul Food, and even the hidden blues/jazz club within shouting distance of City Hall, today there are a plethora of dumps along the sad streets of T-town; and there is Settimo Cielo. \n\nBorn out of the ruins of an older restaurant, Settimo Cielo came into the world with the vision that this once proud city still held the potential for a classy well appointed joint that could kitchen up high quality Italian dishes.  Surrounded by State office buildings and concrete pill box garages, this oasis has been around long enough to prove the truth of that dream.  \n\nIf they cook it right, they will come.\n\nWent there for a business lunch the other day with two other attorneys who work in town.  They are semi-regulars, and were excited to bring me there for a sit down.  It was great to be able to walk there from their office near the County Courthouse.  Upon entry, the drab street was promptly left behind, and we entered a cool umber dining room complete with art and mirrors, tablecloths and shining silver.  The menu was presented, water poured, and specials announced within minutes.  Everyone had a Spanish accent, and that added to the intrigue of what was going on in the kitchen.  \n\nI have learned to eat light for a business lunch, so as to impress my companions with my lean approach to work.  No room for extra calories when preparing for battle.  The image seems to work.  My mates, not concerned with what I thought of them, went heavy with Pasta and a Creamy Vodka Sauce.  I heard there was a Spinach Salad Special complete with Pears and Apples, and went for that. \n\nThe Bread Basket offered decent baked dough, but perhaps not what exited the ovens of Italian Peoples or the belated Colonial.  Still, the crunch was satisfying.  My friends seemingly inhaled their thin pasta, while I navigated through an excellent fresh green Spinach Salad that included a touch of Blue Cheese and Walnuts.  It wasn't big, but it was tasty, and served the purpose of demonstrating my cross-pollinated Spartan/Epicurean style.  \n\nIt was a satisfying lunch on several levels, not the least of which was the positive experience surrounding the food. \n\nSettimo Cielo is certainly worth a return evening visit.",

There is much more on the lunch and dessert menus, but they must wait for another time, when I don't have to run off to the office.  \n\nI hope Bonjour Creperie Caf\u00e9 does well at this location.  This office complex does not offer any alternatives, and it is nice to have a quality vendor close at hand for the folks who work here. There is also an outdoor area for good weather dining.",

    "text": "With Philly off limits for the arrival of Pope Francis, I took the opportunity to explore a different part of the Universe and drove out to Telford for a taste of the Vietnam Caf\u00e9 & Restaurant.  As the saying goes, \"One door closes, and another opens...\" And, so it was on Saturday night.  \n\nThis family owned and operated Viet house has been at this location over ten years.  Upon approach it looks to be small and designed for take out, but on entry the large size of the dining area comes into view.  Plenty of room for dozens of people with tables off to the right.  Orders and most table service are provided by one gentleman who appears to be at least a manager of the shop, if not an owner.  His torn jeans approach to his job suggests the later.  \n\nWe opted for Summer Rolls, Grilled Pork Banh Mi, and Chicken Fried Rice.  They were all very good.  The Rolls were stuffed with large Shrimp and ground Pork.  The Peanut Dipping Sauce was pretty much standard, but was the expected complement to this appetizer.  The Banh Mi was very good with fresh French Baguette, well-grilled and BBQed Pork, and ample sliced Cucumber, Carrots and Cilantro.  A squirt or two of Sriracha and the crunchy supple sandwich came to life.  Loved the bread.  The Fried Rice was really unnecessary, but it was a huge mound of freshly made White Rice full of Chicken and Veggies.  I would pass on this in the future. \n\nThe patrons here looked like the remains of the hippie literati with some curious couples thrown in the mix.  We fit right in!\n\nNow that the Pope has departed, I will more likely return to Philly for my Vietnamese fix, but Vietnam Caf\u00e9 & Restaurant was certainly as good as most of those I have tried around Washington Avenue.  Good to know it is there should the city fathers over react again to the coming of an international superstar.  With the Democratic Convention coming next summer, Telford could get another look.\n\nPRO TIP - The Banh Mi is not on the menu.  They are found on the walls of the joint, and are available for the asking. \n\nPRO TIP 2 - Pay your check at the register.",

The space is tastefully decorated with Asian influences.\n\nThe takeout menu fits on one page, front and back, so it is not too complicated, even for a first time customer.  Appetizers run from spring rolls to fried egg rolls, dumplings and sugarcane wrapped ground shrimp.  We were there for the Pho, and had Pho Ga (chicken in steaming chicken broth with a heap of rice noodles).  The garnish of sprouts, basil leaves, jalapeno slices and lime, was fresh and added great textural flavors.  The Pho comes in two sizes, kids and regular.  The regular bowl is large enough for your pet goldfish (to swim in comfortably). Next time we intend to branch out into the sandwiches and grilled entrees, as they looked real good on the next table. \n\nI have loved Vietnamese coffee since visiting Ho Chi Minh City, and it was exactly the same with condensed milk and personal size french press coffee drip at the table. \nThe fresh fruit smoothies looked tasty, too. Next time.\n\nBottom line - Maybe not quite the experience of a Pho cafe in Da Nang, or our bigger cities, but still authentic, flavorful and worth the trip. \nHighly recommended.\n\n2.20.13 - I have been back a few times and tried the Tea (personal teapot and wonderful teas), Sandwiches (BBQ Pork on authentic French Demi Baguette very tasty), and Mango Smoothie (creamy, fruity and so good going down).",

The high ceilings and exposed beams still smell of cedar, and the stone floor and windows help create a perfect ambiance for a fun evening. \n\nLuckily for us, several of the best restaurants in Newtown pitched in with contributions of their popular dishes - La Stalla, Vecchia Osteria, Piccolo Trattoria, State Street Kitchen, Slack's Hoagie Shack, and Starbucks gave us more than enough food to keep us sated throughout the night. Kate Sotillie and Chuck Ball performed perfect accompanying music (she can really sing, and Chuck plays acoustic guitar with flash and style).  Kings of Leon! Fleetwood Mac! Adele!

It is rich and complex with subtle anise undertones that seem to shift in intensity from top to bottom of the bowl.  It is really quite amazing.\n\nI ordered the Rib Eye Steak in a regular (small) bowl and had it steaming my glasses in under 5 minutes.  The side accoutrement of Thai Basil, Jalapeno slices, Lime wedge, and Spouts were all fresh and plentiful.  After using all I wanted, there was plenty remaining on the plate.  I pushed them aside to make room for the Sriracha and Hoisin Sauces into which l dip the beef for eating.  \n\nMaybe I am just a barbarian, but with broth this good it does not make a difference to me what meat goes into the bath, aside from its contribution to the flavor of the soup.  The wonder of the pho is all about the taste of the broth.  The most important thing is to be sure to finish every last drop in your bowl to reach and savor all of it.  Don't worry if you want to pick up the bowl and pour the contents down your gullet.  \n\nThat's what everyone else is doing anyway! \n\nCASH ONLY - Minus 1 star for lack of convenience.",

They have an extensive breakfast menu for the early crowd, which I was there to take advantage of.  The place was clean and attractive in an old school way, and service was warm and efficient.  \n\nI was looking for French Toast, and Bela had a couple of choices.  Short or Tall Stack of Texas Toast styled egg fry, or the same in \"Stuffed\" versions with sweet cream cheese and fruit of choice toppings. Tempted, but I ask for the regular shorty.  A few minutes later, a large white round plate arrived with a nicely powdered sugar dusting of well grilled Pan Grille Francaise. \n\nThe egg had been mixed with vanilla, sugar and cinnamon long enough to absorb a lot of flavor, and left on the iron sufficiently to allow the edges and ridges in the bread to be caramelized.  The chef knew his stuff.  The thick toast looked great, especially after a melting of butter, and pour over of packaged Smucker's syrup.  The taste and texture were fine, and a nice reward for waking up early enough to indulge this morning. \n\nI was the only customer today, which is unfortunate for all the folks who are missing a good wake up.  Even the coffee was fresh and strong.  \n\nIf there was anything that kept Bella from ringing a fifth bell, it was the use of packaged corn syrup sweetener, rather than having a maple syrup option.  I would have gladly paid an extra sum for the chance to turn this French Toast into something magical with the addition of real maple grade B dark, to complement an otherwise excellent presentation.   \n\nNice going!",

Each order is individually prepared when it comes in, so nothing is sitting around waiting for an unfortunate to consume a less than prime meal.  I found the chicken to be moist with nicely spiced breaded and fried coating.  The Ribs were large, dark brown from the basting sauces, and nearly \"fall of the bone\" tender.  The BBQ taste was both sweet and tangy, just as it should be.  The Wings are larger than found in most outlets, but the hotness covers every nook and cranny.  \n\nI can't say that these items were the best I ever had, nor that they were as good as it gets.  Yet, given what is available in the area, they are all on the high end of taste and enjoyment, and for me, there is no need to look further afield to satisfy my Fried Chicken Addiction. \n\nAnd, if you come on a Sunday afternoon you can enjoy an impromptu car show in the parking lot.  Folks are there from all over opening their hoods and hooking up their stereos to external speakers so everyone can check out their wheels to Deep Purple.",

    "text": "East Lincoln Highway, Langhorne, PA, is primarily noted as the location of the Reedman-Toll automobile dealership, the largest car outlet in the country. In its shadow are many smaller businesses, including this Friendly's restaurant. Obviously, it is well known, as when I arrived around 7 pm on a Sunday night, it was more than half full of customers chowing down on the traditional American cuisine and ice cream desserts for which this chain is known. \n\nI was guided to a booth along the front wall by the hostess, and handed the laminated multi-paged menu. Their Sriracha Burger sounded interesting, and I went with it, medium. I was assured by my server that I would receive a pink finish from their never frozen ground beef.  She was right. Unlike many burger joints that promise the desired degree of grilling, but inevitably deliver only a well done puck, this kitchen did keep its word. I was given a medium burger that was lightly pink throughout. Gratitude. \n\nThe rest of the accompaniment - pepper jack cheese, bacon, onion straws, lettuce, tomato, sriracha mayo, on brioche bun - were all present and accounted for, although the \"crispy\" onion was soggy. The overall taste satisfied my burger craving for the week. At ten bucks it was priced beyond its actual value, but it was good to know that Friendly's was keeping up with the burger wars, where every food emporium had to offer a decent six ouncer to stay competitive. \n\nIt is safe to say that Friendly's keeps up with the other franchise Joneses in this universe. You can come here for a burger or other of their beef and chicken offerings, and leave sated. And, if in the mood, their ice cream makes for a very convenient and creamy end of meal. \n\nLooks like Friendly's will be around for a while longer. \n\n3.5 STARS",

It is run by college students, which keeps the energy level high to offset the laid back atmosphere in the woody dining room. It also means less than consistent service as sometimes they are more engaged with themselves than customers. No big deal, but you don't want to be that guy who gets impatient waiting for the bill with empty plates on the table. \n\nMy Firecracker Burger was a fresh ground half pound of round steak and brisket, finished to the requested medium on a decent bun. The taste was excellent, with a never frozen texture and true beef flavor. Liked it alot. The side of fries were likewise taters just moments before the drop into boiling oil. Crisp, lightly salted, with plenty of those little nibs to crunch. \n\nPrices are reasonable @ between $6.50-7.50 per, but everything else costs, so it is hard to get out at less the ten bucks a person. \n\nThis is New Hope (No Hope), after all.",

Mayo and lettuce caused slippage, and my fingers bore witness to the consequence. Fries were decent and there were plenty of carbonated beverages, while not the excessive choice of the new fangled sodie machines. \n\nService was amazingly efficient for a fast food operation, with servers walking my tray over to me beyond the counter.

Operated by Chinese folk, it offers Japanese sushi and Chinese American standards in a room that feels much more oriented toward raw fish. A lot of money was spent on dark slate floors, white wavy walls, nautical wallpaper, and subtle lighting. No denying the place is beautiful. I was pleasantly surprised by how good it looked. \n\nI was there to try their Chinese lunch menu, and was not disappointed. For $6.50, all the usual suspects were available with soup or eggroll and fried/white rice. While most deliver such deals in takeout packaging or cheapo plates, my meal arrived on a strong white sculpted platter and metal flatware. The black tea (+$1.50) came in a ceramic mug and with strong flavor. \n\nThe General's Chicken was well prepared (although a lighter coating would make it better), with a legit semi-hot amber sauce complete with small Szechuan chilies. The fried rice was copious, but could have been warmer. The wonton soup had a good light broth, with average wontons. Service was friendly and timely. \n\nI walked out $10 lighter, but quite satisfied with my Friday afternoon meal. \n\nPRO TIP - Walk to the back of the house to see the sushi bar and fish tanks, the second of which has a few Gar in the crystal tank. Exquisite fish.",

    "text": "When another Chinese restaurant was closed one night this week due to broken air conditioning, we turned again to my trusty Yelp app to find another Middle Kingdom kitchen in the vicinity. Henry's China Inn was right down Krewstown Road about a quarter mile, so we decided to give it a go.  \n\nTurns out that Henry no longer owns this house, but at 90 he can be forgiven for retiring and living the good life.  The current owners have been at it for several years, with husband chef working the wok, and wife hostess and service provider doing her social thing in the front of the house, along with a few other employees, who all seem to be content in their positions. \n\nThe menu is pretty much traditional Chinese-American fare, with lots of pork, chicken, shrimp and beef for combination with rice or noodles.  There is also a page of specials that allow the wokmaster to show off his talent.  We ordered three dishes, intending to bring home the remains for stepson who chose not to join us.  Salt & Pepper Shrimp, Orange Beef, and Eggplant in Garlic Sauce were our selections.  All were actually better than expected in terms of both quality and quantity.  \n\nThere were about ten large shrimp very lightly breaded with enough salt and pepper to make it a fairly spicy dish.  It was cooked just enough to allow max taste, while leaving the crustacean juicy and fun to chew.  They were laid atop a mix of chopped green pepper and onion that supported the dominant flavor of the shrimp well.  Solid!  The orange beef was a full load, flash fried to a nice crunch, and drowned in a dark brown orange based semi-thick sauce.  We had requested it to be very spicy as the menu suggested was an option, but it arrived sweeter than we wished, and returned it to the kitchen for more chili to be blended in.  Second time was improved, but we still asked for a side dish of hot oil which we poured on top. That was the ticket. It would never be mistaken for Szechuan style, but it least it provided a pleasant burn on top of the Guandong sweetness.  Finally, the eggplant was very good and plentiful, and a nice counterbalance in both taste and texture. \n\nWe had a good conversation with Madame owner, and enjoyed the overall experience of our visit to Henry's.  We realized that it was difficult for a non-Szechuan kitchen to create the numbing flavor we were asking for, so we decided that going forward we would pack a jar of our favorite crispy chili in oil sauce when we went out for Chinese dinners, just in case we wanted to feel the burn, so we could doctor the dish to our specifications.  \n\nHenry's is a utilitarian space, designed for eating in without flourishes of heavy Chinese d\u00e9cor. Still, it was comfortable and clean.  We left very satisfied. \n\nBYOB.",

    "text": "I've been conducting an informal tour of all the Mexican, Guatemalan, Salvadoran, Puerto Rican and other Central American restaurants that have sprung up in the Trenton-Hamilton area over the past few years, and generally replaced the Italian houses that came before them.  The transformation has been amazing, and after sampling lunch in more than half a dozen shops, I am impressed.  City populations evolve over their lifetime as one ethnic group after another emigrate from somewhere else to a future in a new place. \n\nSo it is here, where the shift from southern Europe to South America has been steady and irreversible.  Of course, all this change is much easier to take whether you are part of the migration, or merely observing it from the comfort of your barstool or table for four, when the culture and cuisine are generally neutral to positive (no worse than what came before to the open mind and unbiased palate). \n\nWhile I love Italian food (and even married into the tribe), I find myself thoroughly enjoying what has replaced it.  Las Casas Mexicanas are by and large, excelente.  This is very true of Taqueria El Mariachi on South Olden Avenue in Trenton, just west of Greenwood Avenue.  \n\nIt was a rainy afternoon when I approached for lunch and found the adequate parking lot behind the row of buildings that house TEM. I was able to pull up directly behind their place and enter immediately through the back door. Barely a drop reached me, and the sketchiness of the street scene was minimized drastically by this direct access.  Walking by the kitchen, the staff smiled and directed me to the dining room, where they promptly followed me to my chosen table with menu and water glass.  The attractive waitperson spoke little English, but between my broken Spanish and her charming Spanglish, we got through introductions and my order of Flautas de Pollo (literally, Chicken Flutes).  \n\nWhen my plate arrived, it was covered over with Lettuce, Tomato, Onion, Avocado, Beans and Cheese.  The Flautas were buried beneath, almost invisible.  Cutting through the salad I uncovered four rolled corn tortillas stuffed and overflowing with a Chicken Cheese and Spice mix.  It was very well done. Delicious and fun to eat. Also, quite filling.  I ended up eating the stuffing out of two Flautas and leaving the flutes behind.  I also had a drink called, \"Jamaica,\" which was a sweet fruity juice that I took to be Jicama and/or Pomegranate. All this, plus change for my $10.  \n\nThe house has the same casual and divey atmosphere of most of the other Mexi and Guat spots I have tried so far.  The majority of the costumers were eating in their work clothes and were comfortable as if at home. I like this laid back setting.\n\nI will continue my tour, but can easily recommend Taqueria El Mariachi for a good, filling and cheap Mexican meal.  \n\nPS.  This place is definitely Mexican.  It says so on the menu, and I asked my server (en Espanol) the nationality of the cuisine.",

It has a small dining room with about ten tables, as well as an outdoor seating area in good weather.  It is open for lunch between 11:30 - 3:30, and opens again for dinner at 5:30 until 9:30.  \n\nFrom reading the few reviews, it seemed that lunch specials were available at reasonable cost, but I learned upon asking that that deal is only for take out service. Disappointed, I inquired about smaller dishes on the menu for lunch.  The server informed me that they also made thalis, the famous Indian samplers that offer 8 to 10 different dishes in small stainless steel bowls, served on a tray with basmati rice, naan and papadam. At $10.99 it sounded interesting, so I went with the chicken thali.  \n\nIt arrived about 15 minutes later, with a samosa, lentil soup, chicken tikka masala, eggplant (baingan bharta), potato and pea (aloo matar), chickpea and potato masala, plain yogurt, and honey rosewater gulab jamun, basmati rice, etc. It all looked good, and the heat level was enough to bring sweat and runny nose. Liked all of it, although it was a bit more than I could finish in one seating. The pitcher of lemon water came in handy. \n\nShree Fusion Grill is not haute Indian cuisine, but it is a solid kitchen in a casual setting. The menu tips its hat to \"Manchurian\" style Indo-Chinese plates, and also has French onion soup, wraps and burgers. Clearly trying to appeal to the broadest cross section of the community possible. It isn't Indian Garden, nor Guru, but they know their way around Indian spices and provides a very good meal for those looking for an alternative to the regular daily choices in the neighborhood. \n\nPRO TIP - Plenty of parking in back, if you drive around the corner and follow the signs to Renaissance Center.",

    "text": "The Market at Styer Orchard is several things. First, it is a pretty good deli, making breakfast and lunch for people lucky enough to realize they have a kitchen and small dining area in the house. Second, it is a bakery producing excellent fruit pies, apple cider and other donuts, and a variety of other pastries and cookies.  Third, it is a gift shop with shiny Christmas objects, and all year round seasonal do-dads. A little too gitchy for me. But, if you come for the top two possibilities, the likelihood is you will leave happy.  \n\nI finally stopped in for breakfast earlier this week. At first, I could not find anyone who worked in the deli/kitchen part of the building.  I saw the deli case full of smoked meats and fresh salads, but no one to give my order to.  I saw women in the bakery taking pies in/out of their ovens, but they looked busy.  So, I briefly came around the deli counter and stepped into the back kitchen. Someone was back there, and when I called to her, she promptly came to me to apologize, and take my french toast order. Three slices of wheat bread and coffee, please. \n\nI went to pour my java while waiting for the grillwork. There was limited selection, and it was clear that caffeine was not the priority around there. When I finally got a fresh cup and added milk it was really rather ordinary.  For $1.40 for the larger size, I really won't complain, other than to say a better bean would lead to happier customers. The Market was def not a caf\u00e9 (But, it sure could be!). \n\nMy grilled egged bread was very good, however. Large slices of wheat loaf, dipped in a superior mix of egg, sugar and vanilla extract, that when kissing hot iron really caramelized the surface of the bread.  It had that light sweet crispness that I love in french toast. They fell short by only offering Smucker's syrup, rather than pure maple, but that would be expecting too much. \n\nGiven what's happening elsewhere in the vicinity with coffee and pleasant coffee houses, the potential at the Market @ Styer Orchard is tremendous.  They already have a superior bakery and deli, so they are way ahead of the game. Just bring in a coffee maven barista with the right equipment, redesign the floorplan a bit to make it more attractive and comfortable, and this joint would be jumping! I'm not talking slick, because you still want the current regulars to come in for their apple cider donuts and chicken salad sandwiches; but toned up enough to get the after workout and business breakfast crowd interested enough to make it a primary pit stop. Check out Be Well Bakery & Cafe in Huntington Valley to see what is possible.\n\nThis place is an undiscovered vein of gold waiting to be found by someone with a little imagination, capital, a touch of design skill and love of coffee.\n\nWish that person was me.",

The area where it once resided is now just a seating area on the second floor of the medical center, with several high tops still in place where customers once sat. I was surprised how few people I saw inside the large building, especially considering how crowded the parking lots are all around the institution. Understandable how a small business couldn't survive in the absence of many people as potential customers and a cheap cafeteria on the lower level. \n\nBut, fear not. \n\nStarbucks now has a micro stand inside Lori's Gift Shop on the first floor near the front door.

So, after a particularly horrific week of office moving and presidential election poll working, I wandered through Morrisville one evening this week and found M & M Nail Bar Spa in the shopping plaza just off Trenton Road.  \n\nEven though it was 15 minutes to closing, and the front door was locked, the woman running the shop was happy to let me in and give me the full foot deal for $23.  Very much appreciated.  Hot soak, salts, scrub, clip, dig, sand, and massage, accompanied by my choice of alcoholic beverage, juice, tea or coffee.  Very cool way to mellow out.  \n\nThirty minutes later my wheels felt like Fred Astaire's feet - Happy, light and content.

It is shoehorned into a rowhouse footprint, with beautiful dark wood backbar, small dining area against the opposite wall and a step up space in back on the way to the restrooms. Kitchen in the basement. \n\n\"Dark,\" is the operative adjective here, because the lighting is so dim aside from a string of Christmas lights that even reading the menu, let alone eyeballing the meal, was a challenge. That's not necessarily a bad thing when the cocktails, beer and food are all first rate, and visuals only serve to support the party going on in your mouth. So it was @ Royal.\n\nWe started with a draft of Free Flow IPA, which had a refreshing grapefruit subtext, and a Fat Tire under glass. As Royal rookies, I went for their famous Angus burger (Gouda and whole Longhot Pepper being the most notable elements), and the special spicy shrimp tacos. Both were excellent, with the burger a perfect medium finish and hot to trot on the tongue, and the three tacos barely rollable with shrimp, lettuce, salsa and avocado loaded within. Damn good fries, too. \n\nOf particular convenience to Washington Avenue and the Asian markets there that we came to stock up for upcoming Spring Festival. We just put all that stuff in the trunk and walked over to Royal. Made parking a non-issue. \n\nGotta do this more often!",

But, I caught sight of a roadside flag as I approached, and was able to pull into the parking lot without problem. \n\nThe shop is bright white, with limited indoor and outdoor seating. Mike carries about 12 - 15 flavors at any given time. Only hard ice cream. No soft serve.  There are a combination of young and older kids working there who are friendly and efficient. \n\nI ordered the two scoop medium size cup of butter pecan and peanut butter cookies & cream. They were large scoops and plenty for this lonesome traveler. It became obvious that Unca Mike really did mix his own flavors. Originally, the peanut butter cookies and cream had been two distinct flavors, but he must have been running low on the ingredients for both, and just threw them together to use them up. Necessity being the mother of invention, the result was the best of both worlds. Excellent peanut butter swirl and cookies and cream playing off each other like old friends who don't visit too often. So, in fact, I received 3 flavors within the two scoops. \n\nNo complaints. \n\nThey all were richly creamy and bursting with taste. Very good ice cream all around. At $4.50, it was a excellent deal. \n\nThis Uncle Mike knows from ice cream.",

We didn't know that until after we ordered, having cozied into the few chairs around that mesa and sipped their excellent coffee. I guess they took pity on us and allowed us to stay and eat our breakfasts. Or, maybe it was me taking pictures, asking questions and letting it slip that I would write a Yelp review about the experience, that changed their minds. Thank you.\n\nWe went with a breakfast special of doubled sausage, egg and cheese sammy and morning burrito. El senor worked the grill, while la senora was barista, cashier and hostess. Couldn't tell if the young guy making deliveries was family or not. Our grub was great and a good value. The biggest surprise was the new wing of the shop dedicated to java. It was a full blown Expresso operation born from the dozen years working at Starbucks before opening their own business, complete with bottled syrups for flavored lattes and capps. \n\nWe were fortunate to be able to hang out over breakfast and watch/listen to customers and staff interact. It was apparent that the family was proud of their success and showed appreciation to everyone who came in. Admittedly, Belly Busters is a bit of a dive, but only in the best way. The corners may be dusty, but the love and effort are tangible.",

It is no wonder that the place is packed from morning to night.  People know a great thing when they sit and taste it. \n\nIt really is that good!\n\nBut, there is a downside to success.  If you just want to stop in/take out a latte or capp, or even a small lemon gelato slurp, you may end up waiting as long as those people choosing to sip/dine in.  The service is often slow, making a quick business stop on the way to the office or a meeting, problematic.  They really need to figure out how to handle the crowds that love their stuff. The snaking line doesn't work when feeling rushed.  The other issue is the no credit card policy.  What's up with that?! Normally, that suggests a few financial problems that obstruct the acceptance practices of the offering banks.  The success of this venture suggests otherwise.  Cash flow does not appear to be the problem.\n\nOffering an ATM in the back hall by the bathrooms is not really the image a Eurostyle caf\u00e9 should be demonstrating.  This situation detracts from the customer service expected in quality establishments, and should be rectified.  \n\nBut, man, the drinks are good.

Even the queue to the single restroom had cool people who understood the situation and willingly chatted with their line mates.\n\nOur table wait was about 25 minutes, but we made it to a small deuce in the middle of the room, with people on either side. It was tight, but the ambient noise allowed for privacy. The menu was divided into brekkie and lunch on either side of the document. I went with the chicken salad wrap, and DT opted for their burger. Both we're good. The burger seemed hand packed which gave it a softer texture and more retained juices. I prefer a more chunky chicken salad, but had no negs about theirs. We were drinking the house java, which was hot and kicky, but served in small white cups that needed refilling after a couple of gulps. Larger joe vessels would have been more efficient for the staff and felt more generous to the customers. \n\nCafe Lift is a very interesting place to hang out.

We each ordered a sandwich with variations of bacon, sausage and pork roll, egg and cheese on hard rolls. At $4.50 per, the price was right. \n\nDaughter took our order at the cashier post, while Mom worked the grill and dad brought in new inventory. All their Sammies were very good, with special mention to the rolls which were fresh and excellent. Choice of cheese helped, too. Liked them alot. \n\nIf there was any shortfall, it was that the sausages seemed to be those precooked frozen jobs just reheated, rather than a fresh patty brought to life on hot steel.

We ordered two Moo Burgers, one order of fries and a salted caramel shake.  That list cost us $22., which seemed a little on the high side, but perhaps not for New Hope. The dining room was more than half empty, so we took a table toward the rear, and waited to hear my name called.  \n\nThe food was served on an aluminum tray.  The burgers were wrapped in paper with access on one end, and the fries were in a small cardboard barge. The shake was 7 ounces with a wide straw for better suction. The puck was medium to medium well, with lettuce, tomato, cheese and a \"special\" sauce.  Martin's Potato Rolls held the opus together.  They were very good, with a never frozen texture and fresh grilled flavor.  The rolls were strong enough to remain intact to the last bite. Always appreciated. The fries were also right out of the earth, with a short stop for washing and slicing. They were excellently crisp, with plenty of nubs for extra crunch. Finally, the shake was creamy, cool and sweet. Delicious, but perhaps an indulgence at $6 for a smallish plastic cup.  \n\nOverall, we liked Moo a lot, and would not hesitate to visit again when in a burger mood. Far superior to the casual fast food burgers proliferating around the nation.",

    "text": "The last stop of my Farmers' Best, Kobawoo and H Mart Asian shopping day, H Mart falls somewhere in between the larger, well inventoried, but dirty FBM, and the smaller, well thought out aisles and cleanliness of KM. \n\n This successful chain has expanded since 1982, and continues to offer well stocked fresh produce and a wide variety of Asian packaged frozen foods and groceries.  If I were to choose only one stop shopping, H Mart would be the best compromise.  Their prices are reasonable and you can find most of what you want for your exotic food requirements.  I have visited their locations in Levittown and Edison, and again, this one stands in between those two in terms of size, customer service and aisle access/comfort.  \n\nThe most unique aspect of this shop is the space it shares with a decent food court for a sit down or take out dining experience, and the Paris Baguette bakery in the basement which provides a pleasant caf\u00e9 experience pre or apr\u00e8s purchasing your consumables.  \n\nHave you ever wondered how \"H Mart\" got its name?  I did, and went on its website to see if I could find out.  The \"H\" is the first letter of the phrase, \"Han Ah Reum,\" meaning, \"Arm full of groceries.\"  I leave it to the Korean readers to know if that is accurate. \n\nBut, the image works for me.",

    "text": "Market at the Fareway is the successor to the Chestnut Hill Farmers Market on Germantown Avenue, Philadelphia. It is owned/operated by the folks who brought you the Chestnut Hill Hotel, next door. It incorporates historic charm with contemporary cuisine alternatives, including the Chestnut Hill Brewing Company, for a fun and flavorful cultural experience in the heart of one of the most attractive neighborhoods in greater Philadephia (I hesitate to use the word, \"quaint\"). \nIt still possesses the charm of the old farmers market, with butcher, baker and green grocer in house. But, in addition you can enjoy the pleasures of street food like Korean fried chicken, local microbrew beer, sweets straight out of the oven, pizza, and sushi, and more. There is a common dining area for those who prefer to eat while the food is at its apex taste. \nAlthough there is a free parking lot behind the structure, it is often full, requiring a search of the streets surrounding the market. No doubt, the residential neighbors nearby find that annoying, to say the least. In fact, there is litigation going on between the owners of the market and the closest neighbors about the expansion of the operations to include an outdoor beer garden. An agreement between the previous owners and the concerned citizens was thought to deny this growth. The outcome remains to be seen at this time. \nCertainly hope all sides can find a workable solution for this issue, as angry neighbors are never good for business, and overreaching businesses are seldom good for long term peace and prosperity in the neighborhood. \nIt would be a shame to lose the benefit of the new Market at the Fareway, for the sake of an effort to squeeze additional profits from an already successful venture. Why not allow for a certain number of outdoor days for the beer garden every year, and keep it closed the rest of the time? There is enough room inside for those who want to drink on site. And you can always buy some to take home. A special permit would be required from the ABC or State Police to allow for special events, but that seems manageable compared to fighting about this, and leaving it to a judge. \nShould I return, I promise to eat and drink inside until this is resolved.",

This new tropical tan Jersey Shore original shop recently opened in the Village @ Newtown Shopping Center, and the \"Grand Opening\" banner was still strung up over the front door. No question that if you like fresh fruit, smoothies, yogurt and granola, you have come to your little spot of heaven. \n\nThe large wall board menu is a bit daunting to read, but once I adjusted to the sound bombardment from the loudspeakers kicking out rock music several decibels above my comfort level, I settled on a Gogi Bowl consisting of sliced pineapple, banana, gogi berry, granola on a chill base of bright purple dragonfruit sorbet. I took a stool at a high plank table to await my name being called. The place was packed at 3:00 p.m., and it took about 10 minutes to hear my name shouted out above the crashing din. \n\nI retrieved the midsized plastic bowl and spoon and returned to my seat. It looked great. The taste was of very fresh fruit, crunchy granola and cold, almost crystalized dragonfruit creamie. It was refreshing and fun. \n\nAll the while I took in the scene around me. Everyone was high school age. 90% female, and there was no doubt that I was the only one over 30.

It is a particularly dreary intersection in the depths of Trenton, with a few boarded up houses, and war torn streets.  Yet, it you summoned the courage to open the door and walk in, you would thank yourself for bravery being well rewarded.  \n\nSabor Latino (Latin Flavor) is a Dominican house with a kitchen familiar with the cuisine of Puerto Rico, Guatemala and Costa Rica.  The bar room also serves as the dining area, and the staff is friendly and attractively bilingual.  The broad menu offers lunch and dinner with prices below $10 and $16, respectively.  A few HDTVs on the walls broadcasting futbol en espanol, and gentlemen at the bar and high tops conducting business.  \n\nMy server recommended the Pernil special, and I accepted her suggestion.  A few minutes later I was presented with a large plate of Roasted Pork, White Rice, Salad and a cup of Red Beans.  There was also a table rocket filled with a mix of spice and mayo for use on the greens.  The Pork was soft, juice and tender with a nice taste of mild BBQ sauce.  The skin took the fire well and it was crunchy to chew with a stronger flavor from the basting and flames.  The Rice and Beans were solid accompaniments.  The Salad was just some Iceberg and Tomato; not bad, but more of a garnish than a side dish.  \n\nI was checked on several times by my waitperson.  She clearly was concerned that I be satisfied with my meal and overall experience, and was pleasant in her relief that I enjoyed my lunch.  \n\nSabor Latino is yet another of the strong effort coming from the Central American community in Trenton.  It may not yet have the well earned reputation that was Chambersburg for Italian joints in the last century, but this and the other casas are definitely on their way toward that recognition.",

    "text": "I wasn't sure what to expect when I found Tuscany Ristorante on Yelp. It was located on Rhawn Street in far Northeast Philadelphia, just off the Boulevard, an area not known for haute cuisine. But, we were not that far away and in the mood for an Italian dinner. My uncertainty mounted as I found the last parking spot right in front of the corner liquor store, and rolled up over the curb and sidewalk to park. The dudes out front gave me a glance, like, \"What the F *** do you think your doing...?\" I pulled my Eagles hat lower over my brow as I got out of the car and gave them a wink. Sometimes being 6'4\" is enough for street corner respect or at least a pass. Or, maybe it was just the hat. They had less risky things to do on a Sunday night. \n\nAnyway, we found our way inside the restaurant and were immediately taken by the white linen, heavy flatware, and polished marble floors. Okay. This wasn't a local pizza joint. These folks were serious about creating an atmosphere of opulence in the middle of this urban jungle. For the most part, they succeeded. \n\nWhat was even more pronounced was the fine quality of the food coming from the kitchen. We ordered calamari, roast chicken and rice soup, chicken marsala, chicken francais, a side Caesar salad and house veggies - roasted potatoes and broccoli. One thing was better than the next. \n\nThe squid was nicely deep fried with excellent dipper. They were all rings, without tentacles, which gave the impression they were received that way from the purveyor rather than being sliced in house. Liked them, but would have been better if handled completely by the chef. The soup was excellent - creamy, flavorful with lots of chicken and rice. The Caesar and veggies came with dinner. Both were more than adequate, but small in size and just a solid complement to the stars of the show. \n\nTuscany knows from sauces. They did a masterful job on the marsala and francais reductions. The marsala had plenty of chunky fresh mushrooms in a dark marsala wine base. Very nice. The francais was heavy into lemon and white wine with light egg batter coating, in which the thin chicken fillets had been pan saut\u00e9ed in extra virgin, amply caramelized and set afloat. One of the best things I have put in my mouth this year. Wowee! \n\nService was very good. Friendly and casual. Plenty of time between courses, and many stops to inquire of our satisfaction. Dessert looked tempting, but enough was enough. Most surprising was the pricing; reminiscent of the turn of the century. \n\nAside from the poor acoustics caused by all the hard surfaces, Tuscany Ristorante was a total win. We will definitely be back.",

    "text": "The Bristol Amish Market sits just off Route 13 at Green Lane, in Bristol, PA.  It is one of several such markets around Bucks County, and one of the newest and cleanest.  \n\nIf you enjoy visiting Lancaster, PA, and the world of the Amish and Mennonites in Central Pennsylvania, you can have a small dose of that here, but without the traffic problems caused by the interaction of horse & buggy and combustion engines.  The people working here come by their dress honestly, from women's bonnets, to men's black hats and beards.  Everyone is friendly and somewhat shy.  Delightful!\n\nThe small shops within run the gamut from butcher to baker, and green grocer to donut maker.  Everything looks fresh and appealing.  Prices are not on the low end, however.  Compared to their sister market in Newtown, the Bristol Market is larger, cleaner, brighter, and easier to use.  If you go Thursday morning when they are just opening for the weekend, the space is lightly travelled, and it is easy to get in and out without lines.  \n\nAs with most other Yelp reviewers, the highlight here is Mary's Gourmet Donut Shoppe, at the back of the warehouse.  She bakes up excellent fried dough; dipped in an assortment of ultra sweet and smooth topping and icing.  My poor blood sugar!  It sells both cake and light donuts, that spoil you away from Dunkin and the boys. Even the coffee is very good.  Unlike the other purveyors here, Mary's is not really Amish, and employs locals to run the shop.  They are willing to engage in conversation about their wares in much more detail than the Amish butcher baker ladies who only converse with customers beyond the business basics if faced with a determined interlocutor. \n\nJust bought a dozen to bring to the office.  So hard not to rip open the box and dive in.  But, I was good, and allowed the staff to slice the tape sealing the box and savor the sticky moment.  Man, those Peanut Butter & Jellies were tempting!\n\n They were gone before I could pour my coffee.",

Still, even a clean shaven face is welcome in this throwback bar.  \n\nThe suds are amazing in their diversity from local to international, although the kitchen always seems a step behind in offerings and quality.  It is a fun place to go just to hang out and watch sports, or chalk up the old cue.  The prices can't be beat, and this is one of those places where they can sniff out pretension, so best to just be at your ease.  \n\nI don't get down to Hulmeville often, but when I do the Inn by that name is a worthy place to visit. \n\nWalk in. Belly up. Buy a round. Shoot the sh*t.  Rack 'em up.  Break 'em. Set up shots for nightcaps. Head on home.\n\nUPDATE. FEBRUARY 3, 2017 \n\nCame in tonight for dinner and beer. Here, we normally order food and drink at the bar, and bring the glass back to the hightops in the barroom to await the cook delivery of the plates. Their brew list comes on sheets of paper and a wall screen. There were at least 40 choices from around the world and as close as Bucks. \n\nFor drink we ordered Devils Double, a dark IPA, and Merry Monks. I guess we were feeling a little naughty and monastic at the same time. Both were strong mood setters. For nosh, we opted for a medium Firehouse Burger and their Boardwalk Cheesesteak.  We waited for our grub as the bar filled with Friday nighters. Nice, friendly crowd. Dates, friends, co-workers, fams. Bar Lady knew everyone's name and where they sat. \n\nMy burger was a half pound delight on a ciabatta roll, loaded with red onion, romaine and a perfect medium finish. Needed utensils to consume because my mouth just wasn't big enough (I know. Hard to believe.). The Boardwalk steakwich was HUGE, with finely chopped onions, peppers and roasted reds and a layer or American. The roll was great for holding the massive beefy pile and it's drippings, so if you desired less grease you only ate the top of the loaf. But, if you craved full force cardiac compromising taste, you chomped all of it. Freedom of Choice! \n\nHulmeville Inn has been tapping kegs for patriots for 200 years. You can feel it all around you, like a friendly ghost's embrace. \n\nHoist a few together.",

It produces good soft serve ice cream and an assortment of burgers, cheesesteaks and other  fast food that take your mind off the drive through pancake flat Burlington County. \n\nI stopped by for breakfast earlier this week to find out what they were doing to be in business for 70 years. It is a small custom made railroad car like wooden structure with small counter and a few tables. Clearly their success relies on take out. Yet, I enjoyed my time on one of their stools at the green paisley lunch counter. The menu is All Americana standards. I asked about the french toast, and when the friendly server said she really liked it, I went with it.  I sipped their generic coffee while waiting for it to come off the grill in back. \n\nThe walls had pictures of the farmstead and family since inception. Curious about what \"Dotte\" meant, I asked whether it stood for someone named, \"Dotty,\" or something else. I was surprised to learn that it had nothing to do with a person, but that \"White Dotte\" was the name of the chicken breed raised there. I googled that and found that the actual breed was Wynedotte,  an American egg layer developed in the 1880's to produce brown eggs. Beautiful bird, too. Very cool.\n\nAnd, the french toast was very good. The mix had excellent proportions of vanilla, sugar and cinnamon, that completely saturated the three slices of their bread, and caramelized the edges. Surprisingly tasty. \n\nWhite Dotte turned out to be much more than expected. Historic enterprise from one family. Cozy building. Esoteric name that added to the positive impression. Decent grub that made this a stop well worth repeating. \n\nA chance to learn something unexpected and captivating.",

    "text": "Utsav (\"Festival\" in Sanscrit) is the latest Indian house at this location on Philmont Avenue near the border between Huntington Valley and Northeast Philadelphia. It serves Kerala style cuisine, and does a particularly good job with vegetarian dishes. The room is bright yellow, matching that shade of curry. We dined alone this Sunday evening, which hopefully is not a sign of their opportunity for success, because we were quite impressed with the quality of the food overall. \n\nWe ordered the Calamari Cochin appetizer, Chicken Amwalla, Vegetable Salan and Chili Garlin Naan. Pappadam was offered as a table nosh. Enjoyment scaled from decent for the squid, to excellent for the Veggie Salan, with the Amwalla falling in between. An explanation is required.\n\nThe calamari was the weakest link, and not the best way to start our exploration. It was dusted with a grainy flour similar to corn meal, which didn't really work texturally nor flavorably with the crustacean's own qualities. The onion, green pepper and garlic were sauteed in a heavy oil, which actually became the dominate taste. Just not pleasant when the squid should have been allowed to shine. Yet, the chunky, tender Amwalla was very pleasant with its mango mild curry mix. It was an indication of the playful possibilities in the kitchen. Likewise, the veggie salan was a surprising dish based in freshly cracked and poured coconut milk and yogurt sauce. The highlight of our dinner. The chili garlic naan was well baked and very tasty in its own right and as a handy scoop to capture the great sauces. \n\nService was friendly and informative. Prices reasonable and in a range that encouraged some experimentation. \n\nUtsav takes it place among the very good Indian restaurants in the area. Be festive!",

    "text": "This was my first taste from an El Limon restaurant, and I have to say it was very good from atmosphere through loud post almuerzo belching. \n\nWe were the only patrons in the shop when we arrived on Friday afternoon around 2.  There were three women in the store, two sitting at a table in front who quickly stood and took us to a table and distributed menus. The third was in the open kitchen toward the back with a very large ladle stirring something is a mega-gallon pot on the stove. \n\nThe room is decorated a la Mexicana, with bright paint everywhere. Otherwise, the tables/chairs were utilitarian.  The two page menu offered lunch and dinner, with a little space for desert. I appreciated that there were sopas and tortas along with the standard burritos and tacos. \n\nThe refrigeration unit was full of Mexican sodas and homemade huaracha.  We stuck with water and lime, and ordered torta al pastor and tacos pescados. Somewhat surprising that there were no chips and salsa offered gratis for the table, but required a $4 charge. Never saw that in the many other shops I have dined in around the USA, nor even in the homeland. I guess that works for them.\n\nAnyway, the meals were quite good. The tacos were full of lightly fried tilapia, onion, cilantro slung in hot tortillas.  Three were more than enough with sharing, especially with the accompanying rice and beans. The torta was even more engorged with pit fired strips of pork, tomato, cilantro and their own spicy mayonnaise, on a fresh large soft roll.  Delicioso! \n\nEl Limon does a nice balancing act between authentic Mexican fast food and the American palate. They understand their customers are from both worlds. \n\nIf they found a way to provide the chips and salsa in the traditional way, rather than to enhance their bottom line, this local chain would make my short list of favorite casas Mexicanas.",

    "text": "Pulaski's Meat Products is a Polish butcher shop located in the Trenton Farmers Market on Spruce Street. It was drawing quite a crowd when we walked over to their high refrigerated display cases. No surprise when the huge selection of sausage was sighted. They had dozens of choices from pork, beef, lamb and combinations stuffed tightly into skins. There were kielbasi of every rank and order, even a cherry wood smoked variety that captured my attention.\n\nService was prompt, courteous and friendly from the folks in those long white aprons. We opted for a few grillers for the backyard, and one of the smaller cherry woods. Too, the sign said they carried \"Homemade Pierogi,\" so I inquired about them, and was told to go over around the side of the displays to the wall units in the side hall leading to an exit. Found them. Selected the potato/onion stuffed dough. Grabbed two packages. Noticed that they were not homemade, unless they lived in Brooklyn. It all came to about $35. \n\nJust a bit tony for the bad part of the capital city. \n\nWe noshed on the kielbasa on the drive home. Both varieties were very well made and had firm outer skin and tender filling. Sure they will be even better grilled or fried. That night we cooked up the Polish dumplings with a mix of fresh sauteed red onion, mushroom and red & yellow pepper as a topper. Very good after the boil/fry preparation, although I would have loved them more had the mashed potato been somewhat less dense. Enjoyed the combo, but it could have been spectacular with more attention to that detail. \n\nThe Trenton Farmers Market is still in operation after all these decades, and still attracting enough consumers with quality vendors willing to lend their credibility to make it all work.",

In earlier incarnation it looks to have been an auto repair shop. It is a lot more gentrified today, with French, Louis XV paneled ceiling, long bar with mirrored back bar, and beautiful Provencal ceramic tile floor. The space is bright and airy with glass wall southern exposure. It is a beautiful setting for breakfast or brunch. \n\nWe stopped in after an early morning of medical attention and on our way down to Washington Avenue for grocery shopping. We ordered their breakfast burrito and morning andouille sausage, 3 egg and swiss Sammy on torpedo roll. Coffee (hot and strong) all around. \n\nBoth plates were enough for two meals apiece. The burrito had a great blend of meat, cheese and savory veggies. The Sammy was almost as good, but the hollowed out roll didn't have enough crunchy body to offset the oiliness of the andouille. Really needed a French rather than Italian case. \n\nWith everything premium priced to lead to a $30 breakfast with java, it was very good, but not the perfection implied by the cost. Still, Fitzwater Cafe is a winner for this corner of the City.",

Same quality Thai cuisine. Just a much smaller storefront down in Burlington County. \n\nI was there for a late lunch/early dinner last weekend. I recognized the 'mama san' from the original spot, and she confirmed the above information. We chatted briefly before she too my order for Tom Kha Soup and their Crazy Noodles (aka Drunken Noodles). The place is very basic with utilitarian tables and chairs and minimalist decorations. With three rows of tables in a narrow shop there was little room for Buddhas and elephants. \n\nMy meal was as good as I remembered. The Tom Kha was a deep bowl filled with veggies and medium spiced lemongrass and coconut milk broth. Delectible! It was hot enough to warm the gullet, but not so hot as to pucker the lips. Among the best of breed in recent memory. The noodles were Thai Spicy and loaded with more greens, onions, sliced chicken and a few shrimp. It did more fire damage than the soup, but by the time I was a quarter into it, I had adjusted to the flames and was having fun. Excellent brown sauce. Chewy broad rice noodles. The only momentary disappointment was the dearth of shrimp I had apparently paid extra for (without proper notice). Somehow a buck per was not what I anticipated. Yet, it was all tasty enough to be in a forgiving mood. \n\nIt was the Bhuddhist thing to do. \n\nI was punished for my indulgence. Lesson learned.",

    "text": "Nifty Fifty's is an authentic throwback burger and shake joint that epitomizes the Philly scene in the middle of the last century.  Loud, garish, neon-blitzed lighting, the whole 9.  It is diner-like with booths and counter service, and dedicated to the proposition that a great greasy burger, fries and sweet creamy shake are timeless icons that people never tire of.  \n\nThey are quite right!\n\nOur visit last Saturday night was met with a 30 minute queue for a booth.  The line moved along fast enough to hold our interest, and the aroma of hot grease was so overwhelming that we could not have walked out if we wanted to.  It is instantly addictive.  My companion for the evening was a new arrival to America, and this was her first exposure to old fashioned burger mania.  \n\nWe were escorted to our table/booth and handed their bible (menu).  Rather than attempt to explain what this cultural event was all about, I just ordered the ever-popular Bacon Cheeseburger for her, and the Double Cheeseburger with Fried Onions & Mayo for me, along with a basket of traditional fries and a Black Raspberry Shake to share.  \n\nWhen everything arrived on the arms of our incredible server Destiny, I watched as my companions eyes widened as she took her first bite, munch and sip.  They said it all.  She was excited, happy and totally into the experience.  I was a half step behind her as I doctored my burger and the fries with ketchup.  The shake was creamy and cold in its aluminum mixing vessel.  It so nicely offset the crunchy saltiness of the ample fries, and the deeply satisfying juicy chewiness of the burger.  \n\nNifty has perfected the formula for grease to such an extent that you crave it despite knowing it is not so good for you.  The soft bun absorbs much of what is not directly ingested, yet no thought is given to leaving it on the plate.  The fries have a similar subtle attribute that makes them very tasty, especially when there are small nubs in the bottom of the basket.  Love those babies.  \n\nFive Guys approaches Nifty's burgers for taste and texture, but lacks the overall ambiance of this iconic burger emporium.  \n\nI know there are other good things on the menu, but I have never made it passed the sliders.",

The menu offered most of the usual suspects found in Italo-American houses, with everything from salads to pizza to calzones to full dinner. We tried their buffalo chicken cheesesteak, fried chicken wrap and eggplant parmesan sandwich. All were good, although the steak Sammy and eggplant scored higher than the wrap. The torpedo rolls had good texture and taste, especially after being toasted in the oven to finish the job. \n\nThis is the closest restaurant to home, so it will get a strong workout from us, particularly if their pizza is top of the chart.

The \"restaurant\" is really the more important piece of the action at this small Italian kitchen in the Mallard Creek Shopping Center, Richboro. There is an extensive menu with some interesting dishes that cry for attention. \n\nVery glad we went that way, rather than limiting ourselves to a couple of pies as suggested by the restricted name. \n\nWe ordered Chicken Francaise with Linguini, Veal Bruschetta with Broccoli, Carlos Junior with Linguini and a Chicken Parmigiana Sandwich. They were all huge portions, well designed and surprisingly tasty. The francaise was three large breast medallions in a decent butter, lemon, white wine sauce. It could have been more tender and penne would have worked better than the messy linguini. Still it was good, if not best of breed.\n\nOn the other hand, the veal was lightly breaded and pan fried before being topped with fresh chopped tomato bruschetta. It was delicious even if the broccoli had long tough stalks. The Junior was basically an Italian Sausage and Penne dish with a garlicky sauce. Good, but its name was the most creative part. Finally, the Chicken Parm sandwich was immense and very good. \n\nEach dish was enough for at least two meals, so in combination with the reasonable prices, made for an economical family feast to celebrate surviving another week of Covid. \n\nBecause of the lack of attention to detail on a few of our choices, the actual score is 3.5 Stars, rounded up. Refine the francaise sauce a bit, pare down the broccoli to remove more tough stalk, use real Italian loaf for garlic bread, offer choice of pasta on phone orders; and this simple house could approach a five star takeout experience.",

It was fresh, soft, mildly crusty, with sourdough flavor. I squirted extra hoisin into its matrix to enhance the sweet BBQ nature of the pork, and to complement the daikon, spicy mayo and cilantro. It was very good, leaving tiny crumbs behind on the table with each bite. The tea was likewise peachy keen, but could have been bigger than a 6 ounce glass for the price ($4.50).  In fact the nine bucks for the sammy seemed trop cher as well. I guess commercial rents in Ambler are on the way up. But, as South Philly is closer to me than Ambler, except when I have business in Norristown, I will most often continue to take such pleasures in the city when the mood strikes. \n\nOtherwise, the bowl of ribeye pho on the next table looked damned inviting.",

    "text": "We waltzed into the Blue Danube just before 7 on a Saturday night during Christmas Week, and were immediately seated without rez at a very cozy table for two along a back wall that felt very private.  The layout of the restaurant reminds of many other old Chambersburg establishments that set up a kitchen in an old row house. While not in that part of Trenton, it is close enough to offer the same sensation. It was do doubt done in the 60's or 70's, and has all the charm you would expect from a deeply urban environment at a time when Trenton was still an All American City.  Sadly, those days are history. \n\nThe staff is friendly and helpful, and quickly understood that we were first-timers who needed a brief guided tour through the menu. Although my grandparents came from this part of the Old World, our being kosher kept us from sampling most of the better offerings from a Budapest or Viennese kitchen.  We ordered the Danube Sampler, consisting a Pierogies, Stuffed Cabbage, Sausage, and curly Noodles, all in their appropriate sauces.  As an appetizer it was a good introduction to several tastes we would not otherwise reach in one meal.  The star of the plate was the Stuffed Cabbage; tender cabbage and soft ground beef and pork mix with rice, with a mild sweetness that was most enjoyable.  The Pierogies were also soft with a potato/cheese filling and nice Saut\u00e9ed Onion topping.  The special sausage was a very small piece, but that was just as well as the flavor was a bit odd to my tongue and would take some getting used to.  \n\nOur entr\u00e9e was a shared Pork Schnitzel and Brown Sauce with a side of the same noodles.  It was quite good, but not particularly unique in any way.  The Brown Sauce was ladled on a bit heavy, perhaps diluting the taste of the breading and pork. \n\nThere was some confusion about our order, but our server handled it well, and we ended up with a free glass of wine to make up for it.  That was reasonable.  \n\nBottom Line - We really enjoyed the atmosphere of Blue Danube, and the wait staff.  The food was good, but not great.  The standout was the Stuffed Cabbage, with the Pierogies a close second.  I would not rush back to try more things on the menu, but if someone suggested a good East European dinner, I would not hesitate to recommend a return visit.",

Approaching it as it sits on Lower Road running along Neshaminy Creek, it is easy to imagine it looked more or less the same 250 years ago when it was a pre-Revolutionary War weigh station between Philadelphia and Trenton. Historic lore mentions the likes of George Washington, John Adams, Alexander Hamilton and even Thomas Jefferson in the vicinity as they sought safe places to meet to plot the course of independence while the British Army occupied New York and threatened Philadelphia. This historic structure was there to offer room and board to the wayward revolutionists. \n\nAside from newer additions and the outdoor beer garden, the building is basically unchanged since back in the day. Sitting at the old bar in a small chamber with low beamed ceilings and deep well windows, time can seem to stand still. Yes, it could stand some renovation and deep cleaning, but not at the expense of lost charm and legendary significance. I enjoy such time warps on occasion. \n\nBesides, the German menu and beer choices are hard to duplicate in the area. My Wartmeister Pilsner was cold, smooth and refreshing. The footlong wiener house special with potato salad and sauerkraut, a delectable authentic meal. Dining at the bar with Johnny Bartender working his magic, and the 76ers on the tube, was a very satisfying interlude. The hot potato salad was great, and the sliced apple in the sauerkraut a terrific idea, adding a touch of sweetness to the briney sourness. \n\nWhile not a lover of all German cuisine, wurst and schnitzel I like, and Newportville specializes in them. Given how friendly everyone was to this stranger, I can see returning as the mood for a brat or breaded/fried chicken or pork schnitzel moves me.",

The atmosphere is utlilitarian, the service minimal, but the food excellent. \n\nFollowing the sage guidance of Yelp friend Vinny B., we ordered the Resham Chicken Kabob, Lahori Chargha and the Chickpeas.  They were prepared in the kitchen and brought to us about 20 minutes later on styro plates, with a huge basket of naan.  All were very good to excellent.  The Resham was the ground chicken variety, heavily spiced and grilled over open file kabob-style. It came as a dinner, on a bed of basmati rice, small salad, and the order of chickpeas in a deep brown sauce.  The flavor was rich and rewarding. Wrapped in a torn piece of naan, or eaten straight up, it was a treat.  The chickpeas were likewise tender and richly tasteful as they mixed with the chicken in an adventurous combination.  The rice was pleasantly aromatic, although the salad was lost in the party of other dominant tastes.  \n\nThe Chargha is a Pakistani version of roast chicken, well dosed in wonderful spices and in the oven long enough for the meat to easily pull off the bone. The strong flavor was unusual and captivating, requiring two hands to work the cut up parts to access all the chicken between the bones.  Luckily, we found the napkin stash and grabbed a few extras to keep the mess under control.  Really loved this dish. \n\nThe weakness of the experience was the general take out orientation of the business despite the many eat-in customers.  Styro plates and cups, plastic forks and knives, made for a less than fully enjoyable experience.  From both environmental, and personal comfort perspectives, the dinner could have been a complete home run with the availability of reusable dishes and flatware.  It might cost a little more, but respect for the planet and customers, would turn Kabobeesh into a full throated five-star evening.  \n\nIt is still a very good place to go to get your Paki on.",

    "text": "There he was. The famous Steve Stein came out from behind the long refrigerated display counter to greet me and apologize for having his staff request my photo ID and vaccination card before allowing me to enter the dining room to have breakfast. \n\nI didn't mind. This was a new legal requirement for entry enforced by the City of Philadelphia by a fine of $2,000. Actually, I had no issue with the public safety needed to protect from Omicrom, but also saw how it could become rather draconian, while also damaging businesses forced to have customers move through a checkpoint in order to be served. It reminded me of military checkpoints I had to endure while traveling in the Middle East, but without guns and uniforms (at least for now?). Still, far from a pleasant prospect, and one I hoped wouldn't be necessary for long. \n\nThe facility is a classic Kosher style Jewish deli/restaurant, with 75% dedicated to smoked meat, fish, and a large variety of salads, knishes, bakery and many premade meals. There was also a large green grocery with beautiful veggies stacked high. \n\nI ordered the Fried Matzo with extra Saut\u00e9ed Onions mixed in. It arrived at my table the size of a large dinner plate. While not as crisp as my mother cooked in smaller patties, it was hot, steaming and delicious. A good shake of black pepper upped the spice level to where I liked it, along with the enhanced onion flavor requested at a $.50 up charge. I would certainly get that again. \n\nI also brought home a few Onion Bagels (semi-dense and excellent when toasted), and a couple of Potato Knishes for later consumption. They were traditional and very similar to my childhood memories - light wrap that baked well and held their contents to the end. Loved them. \n\nNot sure how often I'll go out to eat with these Covid regulations in place. They make the risk of exposure impossible to ignore. \n\nWe are, indeed, living in difficult and memorable times.\n\nPS. The complimentary slice of Apple Cake was very good and greatly appreciated.",

A large tray of yeast glazed pretzel twist donuts was coming out, and I immediately pointed to it, saying, \"I want some of those!\" \n\nGreat choice, because they were terrific - light, airy, mildly yeasty and, oh, so, perfectly glazed. Very reminiscent of Crispy Kremes classics, but bigger. The brownies were just as impressive with a layer of chocolate icing above dense chewy choco base. Their croissants were also good, but not as flaky as a French boulangerie would create. \n\nTheir were plenty of cookies, fruit pies and customized celebratory cakes that looked great, but were beyond the limits of my sweet tooth.

It has been slinging hash for more than 50 years, specializing in breakfast, brunch and lunch, but with plenty of choices for dinner, too. Prices have gone higher with inflation pressure, but it is still on the lower end of cost as everything rises under the same economic realities. \n\nI was there for a morning meal, and quickly ordered their Veggie Lover's Omelette, Hash Browns, Rye Toast and Coffee. The three egger was loaded with onion, green pepper, broccoli, snow pea, mushroom and tomato, with my ask for added feta cheese accepted with a smile from my amazingly attentive server. It was very good, with more variety of ingredients than usual. The potatoes were also a large score, with enough crisply browned surfaces to make me happy. The rye was buttered, yet remained crunchified to the end. The Java was was institutional Bunnomatic, but refilled so often I almost felt compelled to drink more just to keep my server feeling appreciated. She was very good, dropping off fresh napkins with each visit and making sure the requested glass of milk for the coffee was also replenished. \n\nTo my knowledge, there are three Golden Dawns in this region; in Hamilton, NJ and Levittown, PA, as well as this one. They are all good, and this may be the oldest in the clan, while Hamilton, the newest. Can't go wrong with any of them, especially if you enjoy diner desserts, which are baked in house, large portioned and generally delicious and inevitably fattening.",

When I stopped in this week for late lunch of a turkey/swiss sub, the wall menu looked like it had been hung in the last century. Still, it was extensive and provided succor for the famished. It wasn't open for in house dining yet, but the husband wife team were well versed in their menu and demonstrated prodigious production skills. \n\nTheir strong suit was that everything for the sandwich contents was cut on demand, and thus as fresh as possible; and decent torpedo rolls (really the most important element of the creation) were pulled from a bag only as needed. My Honey Turkey and Swiss hoagie with shredded lettuce, mayo and hot/sweet peppers wasn't zoftig, but ample enough to warm and fill the belly of the beast. I enjoyed it. \n\nI have been on a deli kick of late, and FD was about as rewarding as the other local family run shops in the region. Good to help keep all of them in business by chosing mom & pop businesses open and thriving, rather than those factory like places that offer gasoline as a side dish.",

The al fresco dining area was not crowded at 2:00 pm, and we settled in to review the lunch menu.  Our waitress was very helpful in pointing out the specials as well as those items she liked the most.

They arrived appropriately pink inside, one with Fries, the other, Chips.  The Lettuce, Tomato, Onion, Avocado and Cheese were loaded on top and encased in a brioche-style bun that held up well.  I was given a few bites and thought it was quite good - fresh tasting and nicely grilled.  \n\nMy Milano Chicken Sandwich was served on the same bun and had interesting tomato based paste smeared on the bread, and more lettuce, garlic and saut\u00e9ed spinach.  I liked it, but not quite as much as the burger.  \n\nThe menu included salads, pizza and pasta dishes that all looked attractive as served to other patrons.

First, very few repair dudes handled Viking equipment, and those few who did wanted my first born as collateral before agreeing to come to the house to check it out.  \n\nI finally called Dave's Appliance Repair in Horsham after the local boys struck out. A real person answered the phone, listened to the symptoms, and seemed confident they could handle it.  Their only demand was that the first visit be paid for in advance. At $90, I knew why. My doctor visit costs less. Still, I paid it, and one of their service techs came for a visit within a few days.  He was a pleasant chap with an amiable sidekick.  \n\nHe started taking apart the exhaust venting system to get to the root of the problem - the burned out motor. He had to dissemble the cabinet in front of it, remove the rear cabinet wall, and return to his truck several times to grab the right tools for this ever more difficult surgery.  He finally removed the dead metal, but didn't have the right one to replace it.  So began a series of visits (three and counting), as he ordered first one part, and then another, until the right one was obtained and installed.  I had to pay for the anticipated parts and labor before Dave would order them. At first, it annoyed me that a deposit wouldn't do, but I ultimately realized that this $900 one time bite was saving money, because of all the wrong parts and then extra pieces and effort necessary to get the job done.  \n\nOur kitchen contractor had installed this stove so tightly to the rear wall, that there was little space to maneuver to get the work done.  Each visit took longer than anticipated.  Our technician (who's name will go unmentioned out of respect for his impressive skills), had to freelance most of the way, because nothing seemed to fit as expected.  Ultimately, he succeeded in finishing the job, much to the relief of all of us.  The exhaust is literally up and sucking. \n\nAt this moment, we await replacement filters.  This has proved yet another saga, as the model number deemed appropriate does not fit in the frame. Dave is having the right size filters fabricated now.  \n\nYes. The multiple visits have been frustrating, but Dave and his people have seen it through, and promise to make good on the entire operation.  I believe it. Not every job is a piece of cake, as this one turned out to be a real challenge.  Still, every step of the way, they have been honest with me about it, and attempted to create a workable solution.  They have been on time, and always courteous and even funny.  The stove and exhaust are working well for the first time in a few years, and once the filters are replaced (rather than just cleaned), everything will be good to go for many more.",

No one bothered to look up, which is a good thing on a first visit.  I sat facing a multitude of HDTVs, and I was quickly approached by the lovely alchemist working the patrons.  She gave me a rundown of the beer on tap, and when I asked about hard cider she offered Angry Orchard Apple.  She also changed the channel on a few of the screens to bring up the Sixers basketball game (not that they would provide any real entertainment).  \n\nThe Angry was cold with a sweet/tart bite.  Very good.  I took a look at the menu and specials board, and wished that I had not already had dinner.  The variety looked appealing, and the platters being served at the bar looked appetizing.

Their food is spicy and often hot, but more subtle than the blast furnace approach found in better known Chengdu-ese molten flavors. \n\nMy companion and I started with apps of Dan Dan Noodles and Eggplant with Pepper. Both were well done, and only mildly hot.  The beef sauce on the noodles was plentiful. The eggplant more shredded than sliced, yet even with the ample peppers, did not raise a fire alarm.  Both were quite enjoyable. \n\nOur main courses consisted of Fish Fillet in Hot Spicy Sauce, Diced Rabbit with Peanuts in Chili Sauce, and Saute Squash.  Here's were the thermometer began to rise.  The fish came in a deep dish with a ton of fillets.  The sheen from the chili oil in which the fish swam was very noticeable, and its red color contrasted nicely with the pale yellow of the odd shaped fish.  This dish was about 4 alarm, meaning my tongue instantly reacted to touching the sauce and began to numb a bit. Just the way I like it! \n\nRabbit is not my fave, but having had it in Chongqing I wanted to celebrate the opportunity.  The meat was on the bone, and cut into small pieces.  The peanuts were a strong presence, helping to control the overflowing chili and star peppers attempt at an insurrection. It was 5 alarm even with the peanuts holding the worst elements at bay.  For me, rabbit is a lot of work because of all the bones and small morsels of meat attained.  Still, it tasted very good, and all of it was gone by the time we called it quits on more eating.  The small green squash was a pleasantly sweet counterbalance to the rabbit's \"hare\" raising. \n\nAll in all a very enjoyable and authentic meal.  Definitely worth a return visit.  For those of us who love Szechuan heat, this place is worthy, even if not at the apex of the volcanic chili scale.\n\nClimb E Mei and taste the view from the top.\n\nAll this for under $50. plus tip.",

What used to be an Italian neighborhood with bars/restaurants on every block, have now become a league of nations of Central and South American culture and cuisine.  \n\nStepping into the barroom the first impression is of a darkly lit, yet surprisingly clean and inviting space.  Nice back bar with lots of tequila and rum, an attractive friendly bar keeper who smoothly shifted between Spanish and English, and a pool table under bright lights for the real players.  There is a larger dining room in the back, but I was all about sitting on a spinner and grabbing lunch.  \n\nSymone was attentive and engaging; more than happy to provide some history for this place, while prepping for the evening crowd.  She's the daughter in law of the owner, and has been part of the scene for six years.  The menu offers traditional comidas Guatemalteca, which is similar to Mexican, but with a couple of pleasantly different flourishes.  The tortillas are thicker and chewier, and most side dishes offer more than rice and beans.  I ordered the Carne Adobada with Black Beans and Potato Salad.  The meat was well grilled and spiced with their secret recipe (I asked for it, but she claimed it was a secret even to her).  The Black Beans were rich and creamy, and the salad unlike any potato conglomerate I had ever tasted before.  Cool, chunky, slightly sweet, and mayo-ed with something else I couldn't define, that made it very good.  My Horchata drink was perfectly chilled for the heat of the afternoon.  Loved it.  \n\nAll the while, Symore returned to be sure I was satisfied, and tell me more about the operation.  She even allowed a photo when I suggested it would be a boon to business.  \n\nTake a look.  You can see why.",

    "text": "Mercer Caf\u00e9 at the corner of East Westmoreland and Mercer Streets in Port Richmond, Philadelphia, PA, is a classic neighborhood restaurant that helps give this section of the City of Brotherly Love its distinct character. It has a cozy, clubby atmosphere and a strong kitchen for classic and neo-classic menus focused on the morning and afternoon meal.  There is a small counter and a couple of dozen tables in the front of the house facing Westmoreland, and many more along the wall to the back of the house.. It is a very nice place to hang out with excellent La Colombe Coffee, and your favorite breakfast or lunch repast. \n\nOur basic egg, hash browns and wheat toast, and Greek-style omelet (I edited the ingredients), were both solid meals, yet not the knockouts they could have been. We found the potatoes to lack crispness and be overly salted. Too, there are unusual upcharges on any bread accompaniment other than plain Jane white.  Their whole wheat option costs a few dimes more, looked good, but lacked any identifying flavor. It was just a good sponge for the runny over easy yolks. Similarly, my omelet which contained onions, spinach, tomato, feta and those taters, was pretty good (especially with a large dose of Cholula), but the premium rye toast was smallish and far from the freshest bread I have eaten for an additional half buck.\n\nThere must be a business reason for costing out the meals with add-ons for bread choice, but it is idiosyncratic to say the least, especially when the quality of the loaves denies that they could have cost so much more than the white. \n\nStill, putting that aside, Mercer Caf\u00e9 is a strong city breakfast and lunch nook, with superior Java, that can easily become a favorite stop on the Philadelphia breakfast train.",

Endless French Fries are also a plus for the hungry. \n\nI know there are other things on the menu, but I have never gotten beyond the ground beef disks, fries or rings. \n\nIt compares well with Cheeburger Cheeburger, although it may lack a little something side by side with a 5 Guys.  As Grease Palaces go, Red Robin is a solid alternative, and scores well on the comfort scale and as a family activity destination.\n\n08.12.13 - Returned after a movie at Neshaminy AMC. Same roadhouse atmosphere and friendly service. The special Berzerker Burger was nicely spicy and medium pink. Son was way happy with his basic Bacon Cheeseburger.  His thing is to put the fries inside the bun, and he relishes that first bite confirming his sound judgment. We split a Van Shake. It was pretty good, but not at the level of Nifty Fifty, or Chick Fil A. \n\nStill a 4 Star experience. Very pleasant place for a above average burger.",

Apparently, there are at least three other shops, as this one says it is number IV. I can understand why they have expanded.  Their food is very good as far as old school pizza parlors go.  Short menu with the usual suspects, but what they do, they do well.  This is a family operation, and during the course of my lunch, I received service from at least three of them.  All friendly, efficient, and happy to have one more customer in the house.  \n\nI ordered the Eggplant Parm Sandwich.  It arrived about 10 minutes later on a white oval plate (no paper here).  It was neatly transected amidship, with three layers of lightly breaded, twice saut\u00e9ed eggplant, just enough mozza (not drowning in it), and dollops of homemade chunky tomato sauce with the right amount of garlic and pepper for a great aroma.  \n\nIt is my habit lately, due to trying to reduce carbs, to eat almost every sandwich open face, to reduce the bread intake.  Thus, I was able to eat each layer of eggplant top to bottom, and enjoy each bite.  It was very good.  I couldn't resist a few bites of the roll.  The top was shiny and the bottom nicely showing flour and yeast remnants.  It was also enjoyable, and left me wanting to abandon my dietary resolution for another day.   \n\nThe plan now is to find and try the other Mario & Franks locations and see how they measure up. If as good as #4, the discovery will be a great tasty adventure.",

    "text": "The Liberty Bell Diner on Frankford Avenue, Northeast Philly, is an urban diner.  It lacks the stretch stainless and glass look of the Jersey version of pure Americana roadside \"stuff and go\" restos.  Rather, it is more compact and hunkered down in what is now the parking lot of a strip commercial center that has seen better days.  The location certainly makes for easy parking, but I am sure the green field that was here first, was more attractive.  \n\nThat doesn't stop it was being a very good representative of the genre.  The counter sits to one side just outside the kitchen. The dining room is a nice size with about two dozen tables, white and blue painted walls, dark carpet, and a couple of HDTVs up high.  Service is provided by young women and men in black, who are well trained and friendly, with the right amount of tats exposed on their arms.  Coffee arrives quickly, and they are patient with newbies scanning their menu and asking questions.   \n\nOur Blueberry Pancake short stack was fine, if not outstanding.  Fresh fruit in the mix was generous.  A noticeable shortcoming was the use of Kraft Syrup for the gooey sweetener, rather than something healthier and engaging. It is hard to get passed the heavy dose of corn syrup as its main ingredient.  I would gladly pay extra for a small pour of pure maple dark B grade. \n\nThe Sausage, Egg & Cheese on Kaiser was a crowd pleaser and customizable.  It was easy to swap out of a plain breakfast patty, and into a sliced/grilled Hot Italian Porker.  It made all the difference in creating an excellent sandwich designed for my taste.  The roll was also pleasantly fresh and strong enough to hold its contents to the last bite.  The Hash Browns were forgettable. \n\nThe staff seems to really enjoy the regulars.  There was a knot of ladies in black laughing and commenting on the photos one of the customers was sharing with them.  Even the owner allowed himself to enjoy the moment.  Very cool. \n\nOverall, a superior breakfast stop.",

Lots of paisley formica, too. Definitely not the expected d\u00e9cor for a pizza parlor. Yet, it is fun and it works as part of the entertainment offered in this unusual joint. \n\nTheir thing is the sandwich pouch. Looking like a half pita, but much thicker, it is an alternative to the standard torpedo roll. It is offered for all sandwiches. It does appear to hold greater volume than a hoagie roll, but the trade off is that it lacks flavor, density or any crustiness. It is basically plain white bread shaped like a sack. I chose to try this with the Italian sweet sausage, pepper and onion grinder I ordered. I also had them throw in a load of banana peppers to add some heat to the project. Service was personal and informative. The dude actually sat across from me to discuss my options in detail when he learned I was a first timer at Julio's.  Cool!\n\nI quickly discovered that the ingredients in the sammich were great, with high quality sausage, and plenty of pepper, onion and red sauce. However, the pouch was tasteless and did little to add to the experience. It wasn't worth the empty calories, so I ended up leaving most of it in the basket. \n\nMy word to the wise is to stick with a regular long roll with a crust and a little sour dough flavor. It might not hold all the contents without overflow, but that is why forks were invented.",

So, this place knows from fried chicken, wings, and sammich, not to mention, ribs, burgers and milk shakes. Although painted yellow inside and out, the overall locale might be considered seedy.  Lunch is the time for a reasonably secure check out. \n\nInside, the order/waiting area was surprisingly clean; much nicer than the exterior.  The people working there were friendly, and more than happy to explain the facts of life to a newbie.  I decided on The Original Chicken Sandwich on fresh Kaiser Roll Special, with lettuce, tomato and mayo.  A side of  Wedge Fries came along for the ride, as well as a drink. \n\nWhile waiting, I looked around and was curious to see a new patio area for al fresco dining on the side of the building.  Although 94 F was a bit warm for sitting under a large umbrella, it did seem a nice idea for a cooler day.  \n\nWhen I opened my lunch bag at my desk, I beheld a large chicken breast, pounded and stretched, and well breaded for frying.  It stuck out of the tasty roll on all sides, with the lettuce and tomato making it slick, but still manageable.  This was no ordinary fast food chicken sandwich.  The chicken had not been frozen, and retained its proper texture and moisture. It was excellent, far better than Chik Fil A, or Mickey D's.  It was a filling meal by itself, and I ended up giving away most of the wedge fries to an officemate. \n\nNext time (and there will definitely be a next time), I will try some fried chicken and/or BBQ charcoal ribs.  And, for those dessert extremists out there, they offer sweets from milkshakes to hot apple pie, and fried Oreos, Twix and Reese's Peanut Butter Cups.  Haven't had those since my son was camping with the Boy Scouts, and I was providing adult supervision. \n\n(Yeah. Right!)",

But, looks can be deceiving. Walk in and you find a large space with a high ceilinged dining room with glass roof, separate barroom and lots of tables and booths for a big crowd. Check out the two menus (one for breakfast and another for lunch and dinner), and you realize that Maggio's is more a universal American diner with just about something for everyone, but with Italian style. \n\nWe stopped in for lunch after a nearby endorsement meeting. Escorted to a table and promptly handed both menus, our server patiently waited as we dove into their long list of offerings. Eight pages take a few minutes to work through, but we chose an American burger and Italian sausage, onions, peppers and provolone sandwich. Both came with fries and slaw. Prices were on the high end of reasonable, and I would have been disappointed had the meal not met expectations set by the cost. \n\nLuckily, our lunch was very good. The sausage was housemade - a mix of sweet and hot - at the bottom of a good torpedo roll, overloaded with sauteed onions, green frying and jalapeno peppers and blanketed in melted provolone. Half was enough for me, and I wish that choice had been suggested in the menu. Still, it was excellent. The textural and flavor profile was extremely entertaining. It was one of the best versions of this classic I have eaten in quite a while. The fries were good, but I wasn't there for extra carbs. The coleslaw was minimal, but a subtle sweet undertone to the spicy onslaught of the sandwich. My buddy enjoyed every last morsel of his burger. \n\nMaggio's is a worthwhile stop for folks in the area. I will stick to the earlier meals, as the prices associated with dinner are a bit daunting. If they are able to serve half sandwiches or soup/sandwich/salad combos, the house could be even more popular.",

The store front is a rowhouse with a neon \"Open\" sign in the window and an old unlit sign beneath it.  The front door is open and all you see is a long hallway with dim yellow lighting.  Sketchy characters on the sidewalk make you involuntarily prepare your fight/flight responses.  Be ready for anything...\n\nBut, first walk across Olden Avenue to the liquor store to pick up authentic Polish beer to make the experience complete.  In the back of the store is the Polish section.  More sketchy guys standing around - these 'packin' employees watch your every move.  But, the Xywiec Beer is back there in bottles or cans. I pulled out a six pack of glass and brought it to the counter. $10. minimum for credit cards, so I had to pull out my wallet (I really didn't want to do it).  Done. Walked back across the street and up the front steps of 925.  On the first door to the left was the restaurant sign bidding we enter.  What was behind the door? \n\nI went in first.  I was greeted by an apartment converted into a small eatery.  Yellow walls, stained wood trim. Wall sconces, but little other adornment.  No one else in the main dining area.  We stood a moment and waited to see if someone would come out to seat us.  A few long seconds later a woman appeared from the rear with a warm smile and firm voice welcoming us to her shop.  She was the owner, hostess, and chef.  Very big persona.  Lovely, and I immediately relaxed.  At 6:30 we expected other patrons, but we were the first and only folks there all night.  She sat us at a central table for 4, allowing us to spread out.  NFL Playoffs had depleted her clientele, but we were quite happy to have all her attention.  \n\nAfter getting the lay of the land from the gracious Madame, we ordered off the rather small menu, which is in both English and Polish.  The Polish Plate to share as our appetizer.  It consisted of Meat Pierogies, Potato Pancakes, Kielbasa in Yellow Mustard, and Apple Sauce.  The Pierogies were the least enjoyable part of the dish. While the dough was lightly fried and was a good consistency, the meat was too dense and organ-tasting for me. The Potato Pancakes were large and thin, not very oily, and a good mix of potato and flour (to hold them together).  They were crispy on the edges and tasty with a dollop of Apple Sauce to mix a little sweetness with the mild saltiness of the latke. The Kielbasa was excellent.  Scored before grilling to help the heat penetrate and to avoid splitting, the outer skin was just firm enough to hold the link together, but when bitten, it gave way nicely to allow the very tender innards to meet the tongue, disclosing its softness and interesting spice.  It was the surprise star of the plate.  The mustard kicked up the flavor, but did not overwhelm the essence of the sausage.  \n\nWe had the Stuffed Cabbage and Breaded Chicken Cutlet as our entries.  The Cabbage dish came with Mashed Potato and Cucumber Salad.  The Cabbage was tender and the mix of beef and something else was good, but perhaps a little bland.  It needed something to sweeten it, or at least that was how my Polish-Jewish grandmother prepared them. The potatoes were not hot enough, and seemed to have been plated before visiting the oven. Mild disappointment.  The Cucumber Salad was a cream base and decent.  \n\nMy Chicken dish was excellent.  The breast was large, with a pleasantly hand dipped breading coating it.  I opted for Mushrooms rather than Tomato Sauce, and was very pleased with the freshness and amount piled on the chicken.  Very tasty and definitely something I would order again.  The mashed were again cool and I left most of them alone.  The Red Beet Salad finished the plate.  Served appropriately cold, it was a nice fit, bringing mild sweetness to the mix of flavors in the breading, chicken, and shrooms.  I was happy.\n\nTo complete the repast, we ordered the Blintzes stuffed with Farmer's Cheese, and dusted with Powdered Sugar.  These babies were wonderful.  Perfect crepe wrap, and a whipped sweet cheesy filling.  Light, and a perfect end to the meal with freshly brewed coffee.  \n\nThis is a one of a kind richly local ethnic urban place that is easy to love.  The entire experience from the sidewalk scene, to the liquor store, to the special charm of the owner/chef, make Rozmaryn worth a visit or two.  When a meal becomes the food for a short story you have found something remarkable. \n\nThis was definitely that, and more.",

It is all light wood and stone, with a cathedral ceilinged barroom that echoes with the sound of a full house at happy hour and a more sedate rear dining room for families and more intimate conversation. \n\nWe stopped in for dinner on a Friday evening, just in time to catch the last five minutes of HH. My watermelon-tini and the bourbon barrel aged ale were both nice to get our appetites revved for what was to come. Blackened fish tacos and Southwest burger got top billing. We found both fairly well constructed and tasty, although my try at creativity, asking that the side of fries be poutine-ized was somewhat less than hoped. \n\nThe cod in the tacos was fresh and well blackened in a frypan. The semi-authentic Mexican fixings (avocado, lettuce, aoili crema) we're on target. An enjoyable dish for sharing, although the tiny cup of black beans was cool and not flavorful. The burger was delivered partially medium (as requested), but partially rare, making for a hand packed patty that was partially quite good, and also half less than hot enough. Must have been grilled on the outskirts of the steel. Still, it was okay. The brown gravy that covered the fries was flavorful, but too heavy for the potatoes and turned them soggy, sacrificing texture and crispiness for something closed to chunky mashed. Didn't work for me, but it was my idea so I don't put that on the kitchen. Won't do it again.\n\nWe sat at a small booth in the barroom. Tight fit. The house was full of happy timers of mixed age, all having fun. It was obvious that '59' was a well known local hangout where everyone was welcome. We enjoyed the atmosphere. \n\nNice place. \n\n3.5 Stars, rounded up.",

    "text": "The word, \"Mega,\" normally suggests something very large, but in the case of Mega Quality Pizza it can't be related to the size of their shop, as it is quite small, with only four booths shoehorned into a tiny storefront in the 9800 block of Bustleton Avenue, Northeast Philly. So, maybe they are talking about the immense quality of their pies. Some people seem to like them a lot, but they have never been nominated as among the best pizza in this city. After grabbing a quick dinner there last week of their Steak Royal sandwich, Caesar Salad and Quesadilla at very reasonable prices, I can only conclude that the value offered by the quantity and quality vectors from the kitchen makes dining there a pretty big deal if your fortunate enough to find an empty table. \n\nMy Steak Royal was enough for two people with ordinary appetites, with a load of chopped ribeye, onions, sweet & hot peppers and a splash of red sauce. Of course, the bread makes the sandwich, and their bakery provider has taken good care of them with a premium crunchy torpedo that really came back to life with a few moments in the oven to turn the package into a crispy grinder. It was very good. The cheese Quesadilla was decent, too, but the need for simplicity kept it from being a standout. There is only so much you can do with a single ingredient grilled cheese, even when found in a hot tortilla. Such is the effect of dietary restrictions. The Caesar was mega large in a big bowl, but little more than romaine, tomato, feta, red onion shavings, a sprinkle of parmesan and a plastic cup of Caesar dressing. It wasn't so much that we couldn't finish it, but more that we not motivated to do so. It was fresh, but fairly generic.\n\nWith a third mouth to fill, we would have ordered a small pizza, too, but we did not need it for the two of us. That will have to wait for another visit. As Mega is right down the street from my favorite Chinese foot massage center, that may not be very long. \n\nIs Mega Quality Pizza deserving of that name? Check it out and let us know.",

Those plans quickly evaporated when I was handed their lunch menu by the friendly server wearing a wonderful Italian accent.  Available were many downsized dinner dishes at very attractive sub-$10. Okay. I gave it a try. \n\nI ordered cavatelli aglio olio.  It came with a nice side salad, and a basket of garlic knots/rollups. It was a substantial meal that would easily last through dinner.  The salad was romaine based, with sliced tomato, cucumber and red onion, with a standard balsamic dressing. The bread was right out of the oven and very tasty, especially as sops for the garlic/oil bath of the pasta bowl.  The cavatelli was cooked well, with amply browned garlic throughout.  There may have been a bit too much broth on the bottom of the bowl, but it was easy to adjust to avoid drippage.  \n\nThis was a very pleasing and substantial lunch.  It was certainly bigger than I have encountered in other Italian houses in the area, and the taste was very good.  Certainly, dinner would have been enough for two.  \n\nI came for pizza, but ended up with something much better - a complete meal that was as pleasurable as it was surprising.",

    "text": "First thing - You gotta know what you are dealing with here. \n\nJC Fish Market & Soul Food is a Chinese house that does a very good fried fish.  I walked in expecting something else entirely.  But, with the proprietress shouting into the phone in Cantonese, and the two male workers answering her similarly, it was plain the soul food had a very eastern orientation.  \n\nThere is only one 4 seat table in the joint, so this is fundamentally a take out shop - something these folks do very well. The menu is set up primarily for sandwiches, platters, fried chicken and dessert.  Prices are downright cheap, with the range for sandwiches between $3.75 - $6.95; regular platters (fries & cole slaw), $4.65 - $10.65; and the dinners (two sides, corn bread), $6.60 - $12.75.  The quantities are large, easily enough for 2.  \n\nStill, to make it work, you need to understand how the deal is constructed.  As a newbie, I ordered the Whiting Sandwich.  I watched as the three fish fillets were taken from the fridge, hand dipped in the breading, and placed into the deep fryer.  Five minutes later they were removed from the hot oil with tongs, and placed into a styro take away, with holes in the top.  A pile of pre-packaged plastic wrapped 2 slices of bread were placed on top of the container, and everything placed in a plastic bag.  Plastic forks and napkins were to the side for the taking.  I picked up a square of corn bread to taste @ .85.  The price was under six bucks. \n\nReturning to my office, I opened the package and prepared to eat.  I took out the bread, slapped 2 of the 3 fillets on the first slice and closed the preparation with the top slice.  The bread was soft and fresh.  The Whiting Fillets were great! The breading was light with a pleasant spice mix.  The fish itself was thin and tasted as if it had never been frozen. The cooking oil was clean and added nothing to the flavor of the meal.  The corn bread was likewise fresh and mildly sweet.  No complaints. Impressive. \n\nKnowing what I know now, I would probably head for the platters in the future, to grab a little greenery for my diet.  Too, if the fish was this good, I can imagine what they might do with the chicken.  \n\nIf there is a downside to all this, it is that the meal certainly smelled like fish.  Now, my car smells of it, and my office smells of it, too.  People walking by my door were loudly sniffing and asking;\n\n \"Fish?\"",

From the outside, the place is nothing special, but on the inside, the joint is as bright and shiny as a new penny. Clearly, these folks put a lot of effort into polishing the place to a loud red and silver hue. That, and the old bicycle hanging from the ceiling, and the James Dean, \"Devil Without a Cause,\" poster, tell you what is going on.  \n\nWelcome back to the 1950's! \n\nI was there for breakfast this week, although a lot of the menu deals in burgers, cheesesteaks and other grilled dishes.  Still, the breakfast possibilities were not a short list, and I was able to chose from pancakes, omelets, and morning sandwiches.  I opted for the french toast, which was a full plate (6 half slices) of vanilla and sugared egg dipped decent bread.  Melted butter and a nice pour of syrup (not maple), and it was ready to eat.  \n\nIt was a decent version of one of my favorite breakfasts.  Caramelized enough to enjoy the light crunch along the edges, and thick enough to absorb a lot of the egg and the follow on butter and syrup.  It wasn't the best of breed, but I was not complaining. Tasty and filling. The mugga joe was hot and strong, just as I like it.  At $10 and change for the meal, it was about what I expected from the outlets in the area. \n\nBut, the atmosphere was what really sets the place apart from other diners and cafes.  It is different enough to be refreshing.  Will return for the burgers and revisit the rating, but for now, three and a half stars is about right. Round up to 4.\n\nNOTE: The name, \"steakhouse,\" is a misnomer, as the only steaks available here come on a long role with cheese and onions.",

    "text": "My second visit to Bristol in one week after a few years absence. Mill Street is coming back to life, and the area close to the Delaware River seems to be spearheading the revival. It is great to see a renaissance in this old river city.  It has suffered hard times through some neglectful governments and perhaps not so fatherly town elders. Yet, it is hard to keep a good old ville down when it has natural beauty and a real purpose over the centuries.\n\nSo it is with the King George II Inn. Originally built to be close to the ferry to Burlington, New Jersey, the only way across this water course for more that 250 years AFTER the ferry was started, the KGII evolved into a restaurant and subsequently an inn. Sitting in the oldest part of the building, the tavern, it is easy to imagine what it was like to be living and traveling in colonial America.  The various farmers, businessmen, hucksters, cons, grifters, and cutthroats gathered here to do their business, and wait for the ferry to take them to the colony of West Jersey. \n\nEven today, that historic atmosphere permeates the Inn. Certainly there are ghosts stories aplenty.\n\nI stopped into the Tavern for late lunch, sitting at a small table at the window overlooking the bottom of Mill Street, and the river just beyond.  The server (who was as gracious as an owner) greeted me warmly, took my order, and left me to my mental wandering.  The Pierogies appeared on a long thin white dish, covered in saut\u00e9ed onions and fresh chives. A dollop of sour cream occupied one corner.  They were lightly fried, potato and cheese. They were pretty good at 6 for $9. I knew I was paying for the privilege of location.  No complaints.\n\nThe Tavern itself was excellently preserved and rehabbed to feel very original. All dark woods, heavy oak tables, and mirrored bar.  A perfect place to reenact debates between Patriots and Tories over lagers and locally distilled whiskey.  \n\nIt is certainly worth a visit and a meal if you are into American history.  It is not quite Williamsburg, Va., where the entire community is a historic park and everyone is in costume.  Still, with a little imagination it is capable of taking you on quite a trip.",

The tables and chairs are built for speed, not comfort, but given how fast they turn out a large bowl of Pho and Bun Bo Hue (weekends only), it is understandable that you will not be there very long. \n\nWe came in around six on a Saturday evening, and the place was nearly empty.  We were warmly greeted, directed to a table, and asked for drink preferences within 60 seconds.  After ordering Pho Tai and Bun Bo Hue, we barely had time to start a conversation before the steamy aromatic pots of soup were placed before us.  Don't ask why I went with the large option because I couldn't finish even half of it.  Even the small bowl was big enough to be a goldfish pond. \n\nThe soup was loaded with a variety of meats, veggies and noodles, floating in a richly spiced broth that tasted of secret recipe. Even my prot\u00e9g\u00e9, a restaurant owner in her own right, could not identify all the subtle flavors overlapping and melding with each other.  While she might attempt to concoct the Pho, she was at a loss with the Bun.

It was refreshing to be able to pay a reasonable price for Angry Orchard apple cider, a personal size Old Trenton square tomato pie, chicken parmesan dinner, bowl of chili, and 10 blazing buffalo wings, and get change for my $50. That doesn't happen every day.\n\nThe atmosphere is noisy with high ceiling in the main room that amplifies sound. Upside, you know your conversation is private; downside, you can't always hear what your table mates are saying. The music is a mix of 70's through contemporary rock, which fits my groove well. Service is fine with women who seem to like people and have a sense of humor. Always appreciated. \n\nThe food? Solid bar offerings that can surprise you with it's taste and quality, but may not be consistently so. Big pluses on the chili, tomato pie, and hot wings; a little off on the chicken parmesan dinner. To be clear, the pizza was very good with crunchy crusty edges, tart marzano tomatoes and decent cheese. Not what you get at the new DeLorenzos', but a pleasant alternative. Chili was mildly sweet beneath the heat, and the wings brought tears to my eyes just sitting on the table. The dinner parmesan needed more flavorful sauce, especially with the load of penne it came with. Even dry pepper flakes could not compensate for the lack of spice in the pot. At $20, that was disappointing. \n\nNext time, we will stick with the sandwiches, pizza and burgers - more traditional barfood - rather than treating Old Neshaminy Inn as an Italian restaurant, which it really isn't (yet?). \n\n3.5 Stars",

We went with Fish Tacos (Blackened Cod) and Fish & Chips. \n\nBoth were good, especially the tacos which included mango pieces for sweet juiciness to interact with the spicy salsa. Two were enough. The F&C was also good, but I wished that the outer breaded shell was less oily, as it didn't work as well with the lightness of the fish within. Still tasty, but the inconsistency was palpable. Service was excellent with our friendly white coat attentive and suggestive. \n\nWe agreed that we would certainly give Bonefish another try when the mood for seafood struck us.",

    "text": "Sometimes first impressions are deceiving. So it was with Non Solo Pasta. \n\nReturning to the Italian shop after a few years, this time for lunch, I had a completely different experience. This time rather than order a pasta bowl that was off menu, I went with their standard melanzon parmesan, which came with choice of soup or salad.  \n\nIt was excellent. \n\nFirst, the large bowl of escarole soup was steamy and full of flavor, with white beans simmered to softness for added texture and subtle flavor.  Very glad I went with that over a side salad. The eggplant was thin sliced and saut\u00e9ed in extra virgin olive oil, without breading, and then ladled full of red gravy over the top.  It was tender, light and delicious.  So much better than the breaded/fried variety that adds more calories than taste. Easily cut with a fork.  The side of spaghetti was generous, but truly unnecessary in light of the quality of the star attraction. I left most of that behind. \n\nMy companion selected the caprese salad and the Caesar. The red and yellow tomatoes were ripe and mildly tart to offset the fresh buffalo mozzarella, which was soft and semi-sweet. Very well done and about the best I've sampled of this simple dish. \n\nEverything was well presented and a delight to indulge. After my earlier visit, the quality of this meal took me by very pleasant surprise.  I will return sooner next time. \n\nOnly downside is the lack of WiFi in the house, given how poor reception is in this part of Morrisville. Made it impossible to check in or put photos directly through Yelp. Still, managed to deal with that upon returning to the office.",

    "text": "Located in a tightly designed old commercial strip on Bustleton Avenue in the far Northeast, Philadelphia, Little Istanbul is a small Turkish restaurant with pleasant atmosphere, good service, and a fairly broad menu of Mediterranean and Ottoman style cuisine. With about a dozen tables, it pays to know what you want to order coming in because the room turns over quickly. This part of the city has a strong East European, Silk Road community, and this place fits right in.\n\nWe ordered Red Lentil Soup, Sauced Eggplant, Ground Beef/Lamb Pide and the Baked Salmon dinner. Based on our experience we would stick with the gyros and appetizers next visit, and shy away from the more elaborate dinners and Pide. Here's why:\n\nThe soup and eggplant were excellent, with fresh flavor, plenty of spice and wonderful bread and pita to help it down the gullet. The lentil soup was creamy and steaming hot, and more yellow than red. Apparently, it had a chicken broth base, which surprised my companion. The eggplant came in a tomato and olive oil base, and was served cold. Loved it. \n\nHowever, the salmon, while a thick steak, was delivered past its peak from the oven. It was a little dry and the sauce it came in was not able to revive it. Otherwise, the taste was okay, but it could have been so much more. The Pide is very similar to a dish found in Georgian bakeries. The shape of a boat, it is basically thin dough with cheese and ground beef and lamb spread thinly across parts of the dish, much like pizza in taste, but with more interesting crust. It would have been great with more meat topping, but as it was it was a simple pleasure. \n\nThe lamb and chicken gyros we saw served nearby looked like absolute winners, and we would definitely try them next time. \n\nToo, enjoyed sitting across the dining room from the large photo mural of the Bosporus waterway that transects the city of Istanbul (not Constantinople), and separates eastern Europe from western Asia. A fantastic old fortress city now part of a modern Turkey.\n\n3.5 STARS",

    "text": "This IHOP on Roosevelt Blvd in the Great Northeast, is an older version of this historic franchise. There are only two narrow rows of double and quad booths with open kitchen in the middle where the crash and drum of the cooks and server shouted orders offer a momentary throwback to an earlier time when a family trip to the local pancake house was a very special occasion. \n\nI guess those memories led me there this morning, when I suddenly saw it in front of me as I drove south down the Boulevard. The parking lot is likewise a small footprint, but I found the last available in the row. The greeter sat me at a quad and brought me menu and thermos pitcher of Java. Thanks for the extra leg room, my dear. Your tip just rose a few bucks. \n\nI ordered the Original French Toast Combo (2 slices w powdered sugar, 2 Scrambled Eggs, Home Fries and 2 Sausage Links). No. I didn't finish all of it, but I was pleasantly surprised how good each element was; especially the eggs, potatoes and coffee. The Frenchie was okay, but really need a touch of vanilla and cinnamon to bring up the flavor profile. Caramelization of the edges would have brought a nice crisp to the texture. \n\nStill, all in all, it was a very satisfying meal that allowed a short dalliance in my childhood along with room to stretch my legs.",

Plenty a seating with tables, chairs and more relaxed furniture in the corner. Easily 15 foot ceiling which does impact the acoustics, but almost feels like being outside. A 50 foot wall long black and white panel that pulls the room together. \n\nYet, when I was there at 4:30 on a recent afternoon, the operation was being run by only 3 baristas, including drive through service. Impressive that they managed to sweep and clean up the place during their shifts. \n\nMenu was standard for the Green Mermaid, although the display case was somewhat depleted given the time of day. I snared the final slice of lemon pound cake - my endulgance for the week. It was as tart and sweet as always. \n\nWhile still not a true fan of Starbucks, this place isn't bad.",

    "text": "We stopped by Nina's Waffles & Ice Cream as we cruised Doylestown after the March for Science. It was a first visit, and the instant impression was one of an old time, wood floor, bright walled, musical, ice cream parlor.  A small space for a popular destination, the room had less than a half dozen tables to sit and enjoy their interesting take on hot waffles and cold creams. The high glass refrigeration unit held about a dozen and a half flavors, with the industrial waffle iron right next to it.  As we took it all in, one of the women behind the counter let us know we could sample any of their creamies with tiny spoons.  We demurred, and went directly to ordering a waffle with two scoops of their offerings, Berry Berry and Banana Walnut.  \n\nIt was served in a heavy weight paper boat (like for fried chicken and fries), with plastic utensils, including a knife for cutting the underlying thick waffle.  The cost of $10+ for what seemed to be two large scoops of ice cream and a thick waffle, took me aback for a second, but I decided to consume this dessert before deciding if it was overpriced.  \n\nNina makes her own ice cream in her store in New Hope, Pa.  It is high quality, creamy, and invested in local sourced ingredients (where available), and subtle flavors that demand your attention for full enjoyment.  The Berry Berry was very good, and the Banana Walnut was a pleasant surprise in not having that unpleasant banana extract taste, but a gentle real ripe Chiquita lick.  Big chunky walnuts, too.  Nina knows from ice cream.  \n\nThe waffle did require knife to cut into bite size pieces, and possessed a heavy texture that held up well to the melting above.  Yet, in the overall scheme of things, the ice cream was far superior to the doughy base.  The interplay between the solid and the liquid was pleasing for a moment, with the waffle offering a slight saltiness that magnified the sweetness topside. Still, if pressed to save a few calories, I would opt for all ice cream, and take a pass on the iron cakes. \n\nA few more tables within, and some benches without, would help make Nina's into a true ice cream hangout, particularly on cooler or rainy days, when walking around town with an ice cream cone is not the funnest thing to do.  Hard to lick and hold an umbrella. \n\nStill, if ice cream is your thing, Nina's has something waiting for you that will definitely make you smile. Maybe a tad overpriced the way I ordered it, but next time I would skip the waffle and go straight to the cool delicious prize.",

    "text": "Ristorante Denicola has been around for more than a decade, but I just found out about it last week. Two Yelp friends introduced me to this fine Italian house when we met for dinner a few nights ago, and but for their detailing its location in the Mallard Creek Shopping Center I would never have seen it.  Intentionally or not, it is a well kept (hidden) secret.  \n\nThe front door is inconspicuous, like a secondary entrance near green/white awnings that feel like the porch in the back of a home.  Walking in, it is surprisingly large with rough hewn wood horizontal panels, dark tones, carpet, and nicely spaced tables. We sat is the corner in an otherwise empty dining room.  \n\nOur server was well known to my friends, and she took very good care of us all night.  This family business' signature style is to deliver much more than expected in the form of non-ordered extra dishes that are a surprising addition to the meal.  For us, they dropped off Grilled Veggie Antipasto, Tomato Bisque, Homemade Sausage Pizza, Chicken Breast Joey (a piccata/marsala feel)  and Cannoli, on top of our main courses.  All this was a meal unto itself.  When they then deliver a large plate of Penne A'glio Olio with Saut\u00e9ed heavily Garliced Spinach, the result was taking most of it home.  I'm not complaining, but it again brought to the forefront my discomfort with intentional excess in a world full of hunger.  \n\nHere's the ironic part of the experience - my pasta was very good; al dente with well browned Garlic Chips mixed into the Spinach and Red Pepper dusted Penne.  It was the best of my samplings, but the one I ate the least of because I was already full from everything that came surrounding it.  The gratis accompaniments were also good, but a step down from the main course.  The Antipasto had fresh cut tomato, onion and cilantro on top of the Grilled Zucchini and Eggplant.  The \"bruschetta\" was cold while the nicely grill-ribbed large veggies were warm.  It was an inconsistency that detracted from the cohesion of the dish.  The Homemade Sausage was excellent and plentiful, but the tomato sauce was thin and runny.  The Tomato Bisque had a pleasant creamy texture and taste, but was a little lumpy. The Chicken Joey was fine, but I was beginning to feel overwhelmed and mildly compelled to take a share. The Cannoli were perfect. \n\nThe overall effect was that each additional offering both added and detracted from the meal.  I don't think that was the intention in the kitchen, but that was how it felt.  The generosity of the house also opened the door to mild disappointment.  \n\nAfter this review my friends may regret inviting me, and I am sorry for that.  I will definitely return and ask for a more limited approach to my next meal.  I would rather be totally impressed with the food I desire, and have fewer filling distractions. \n\nLess is More.",

That tip alone alerts you to the fact that Taiko Bistro and its neighbor are closely related.  In fact, they are family; owned by the same people, and put in place after the success of House of Pho led to expansion to cover the bubble tea explosion around the country. They share a kitchen, while House handles traditional Vietnamese fare and Taiko addresses the taste for Asian snacks and tapioca ball drinks. \n\nFollowing directions, I walked into the elder to order Roast Pork Banh Mi, Ribeye Pho and a Mango Smoothie \"to go.\" I returned to my car for the suggested 20 minute wait, as the business wasn't really set up for in house dining. \n\nTen minutes later, the manager/owner/cashier was coming over to my vehicle with a nearly wrapped package. I opened my door to accept the bag and thank her for going the extra mile to find me when everything was ready, rather than waiting for me to re-enter ten minutes later. \n\nThat kind of courtesy is memorable. \n\nThe Banh Mi was excellent. Tasty load of thin sliced roast pork with pleasant hoisin flavor, daikon, carrot, cilantro in a fresh demi baguette. Liked it a lot. I assembled the Pho in a large bowl while it was still warm, but with the large next of noodles, generous beef and desire to add copious sprouts and Thai basil, I chose to microwave the broth to better cook everything else and bring the dish back to optimum. It was still good; the taste was there, but there was no doubt it had lost something in transportation. \n\nThe Mango Smoothie was more a slurpie, with too much freeze and little smooth. It was clearly made from a mix without a hint of fruit pulp. Disappointing. Maybe bubble tea was the way to go. \n\nLesson learned. Banh Mi travels well, and Pho can be resurrected by focuses reheating at home, but a poorly conceived smoothie is impossible to revive. \n\n3.5 STARS",

Bailey's Center now has a bona fide first rate pizza joint on the premises.\n\nWe visited for the first time Friday night. The dining room is small (3 booths, 6 tables), so the reservation made sense. Our booth had been set aside and prepped for our arrival. The house is cozy, and feels a lot more comfortable than it appeared from the outside. The menu is lengthy, with choices from pizza to full dinners and everything in between. \n\nWe began with bowls of pasta fagiole soup that arrived just after a basket of hot bread knots.  Both were excellent. The soup was full of short pasta tubes and white beans in a smooth veggie stock. The bread was out of the oven reheat, yet crisp on the outside and tender soft within. It was mildly salty with great texture. Perfect for dipping in the soup and the platter sauces that followed when unwound and pulled apart. Entrees were chicken francaise and veal marsala, both over penne aglio olio. \n\nThe francaise was wonderful. Egg dipped, pan sauteed in lemon and white wine. Delicious!  Three medallions turned golden brown and tender enough to be \ncut by my fork. The penne beneath was also very good with the melding of the juices. Lemon and garlic are a great combo. The only disappointment was the veal. It was too thickly cut, not tenderized, and a little tough to chew. Too, the marsala sauce was off, more like the wine was turning to vinegar, making for a sourness that was not appealing. \n\nService was friendly and accommodating. \n\nOverall, we were very satisfied with our experience at John Lucas. Far better than expected. Still, it wasn't perfect because of the marsala issue. Definitely worth a try. \n\n4 Stars.",

But, rather than being disappointed by its performance, we were actually pleasantly surprised by how good their food and service were. \n\nWe were in a rush to return home after a large shopping excursion to the Asian supermarket nearby, and opted for rapid food from the only drive through in sight.

It was like the dream burger from the adverts, except this baby was for real. \n\nOnce in a lifetime! \n\nNaturally, it wasn't all ideal, as the nuggets had a processed food texture.

    "text": "Last Christmas Eve when General Washington crossed the Delaware River and marched on Trenton overnight to surprise the Hessian mercenaries in their barracks, he stopped in Patriot's Crossing for a cold one with his officers after the successful encounter. A very cold night, he chose to stay inside at the bar after the long ride on horseback. \n\nWhile there he was greeted by fellow rebels and militiamen celebrating their victory.  Service was exceptional at the bar, with ample choices on tap or bottles. He particularly liked the Victory Summer Ale brewed down in Philadelphia, although the Dogfish Head dark was the favorite of most of his officers. Hungry, he ordered a southwest cheeseburger, loaded with onion, jalapeno chips and spicy aioli mayo smeared on the textured bun.  His charge de camp ordered the mushroom swiss burger. Both came with fries or onion rings. The General always demanded \"Liberty Fries,\" as the French had not yet done enough as allies to warrant naming rights to those potatoes. \n\nTheir burgers were quite good. The beef recently slaughtered and ground by a local farmer, with no opportunity for freezing unless left out in the cold. Although camped along the Pennsylvania side of the river, this Jersey tavern had been off limits to all but the long boatmen who traversed the treacherous currents to trade in farm goods and military rumors. George Washington knew this, and counted on intelligence from these patriots to keep him informed about what they heard about enemy movement. This watering hole was an excellent place to carefully exchange information because although there were few Red Coats brave enough to be out of their encampments at night, there were still loyalists like Abraham Doan around and about, who would happily steal your horse and sell it to the British or trade in military secrets. In other words, it was a den of thieves and spies who bargained in hidden code and dastardly deeds for the right price. Perfect for the surreptitious exchange of information when the fate of the war remained unknown.\n\nThe crowd has not changed much since the day the General stopped in to have a round with his men.  The easy success in Trenton gave him the idea and the courage to attack again near Princeton the next day, to keep the Reds off balance and in retreat. \n\nLittle did anyone know that they were witnessing an important turning point of the Revolution, when the dream of freedom became the possibility of true independence. \n\nLegend has it that General George stops in every Christmas Eve to carry on the tradition. The tavern owner keeps his barstool empty awaiting his arrival. A pewter pint of brown ale sits on the bar near that spot waiting for the anniversary party to begin.",

    "text": "Well, not exactly like Trenton Tomato Pie, but close enough to use the sacred name of the best pizzas in the Universe (Pardon me, Brooklyn). \n\nThese guys make excellent chunky red sauce for their red over white creations. Truth is, they may pour it on a bit on the heavy side, so that the thicker crust becomes moist from the tomato slurry. Makes for a base that can't support the topside, unlike the Trenton pie that uses both thinner crust and less nightshade, yet manages to hold its point beginning to end. Despite this engineering, the taste was superlative. The added mushrooms provided subtle flavor and more texture. So, I am not complaining at all; just pointing out the cultural difference. Both ways work, it just depends which you prefer. \n\nThe chicken parmesan sandwich was also quite good, with enough chicken tenders, great sauce and melted mozzarella for a pleasing full mouth bite. The weak link was the torpedo roll, which lacked crispness and sourdough flavor to enhance the finished mix. \n\nThere was kitchen artistry in both pie and sub, and a better baker would make the difference in reaching my fifth star.\n\nNote to Alex - Thanks for the excellent comment to the review. I still have family on Anderson Street, and totally appreciate what Trenton brings to the (pizza) table. While all the Italian kitchens may have moved to the burbs, the heart remains in Chambersburg (perhaps at Italian People's Bakery on Butler).",

    "text": "Sputino's has a great location in The Marketplace in Doylestown, but it is divided between it's kitchen up front and the dining room further back in this attractive indoor mall. There are a few stools right at the entrance to watch the maestros at work on their 90 second Napolitan pizzas, but a lot more room in back. \n\nAfter standing in the misting rain during the March for Science at the old courthouse, we had quite an appetite, and wanted to give our business to a local shop in appreciation for the town being so inviting to our people. We weren't the only ones with this idea. \n\nWe ordered a pepperoni pie and two Sanpelligrinos - Limonata and Blood Orange to quench our thirsts.  The pie came out in about 7 minutes, looking hot and steaming. These Nappis are always small, and just enough for a snack for two. The edges were scorched with burnt dough and the thin 'ronis sweating out their oil.  \n\nThe thing about this type of tomato pie is that because it is super thin and baked so fast, it also cools quickly causing condensation and a damp crust with minutes. It is imperative to eat it quickly to maximize the enjoyment. Few of us like damp, limp pizza, which these become by the time you get it home. So, eat it while it burns your palate to get the most flavor.  Too, unlike the traditional pizza, these Nappis are all about the crusty dough, not the toppings.  The quality of the undercarriage is what matters most.  So, a great pie maker will use the freshest flour and water, and add the right spices to make the crust taste dramatically superior to the other forms of this art.  The toppings are there to influence the taste of the dough, but not dominate it. \n\nSputino understands this concept and produces a very good crusty dough that hardens and blisters in 90 seconds in the wood burning hive oven.  It is not the best I have ever tried, but it is very solidly delicious.  If you are curious about other versions of these pies, come to Newtown and visit Acqua e Farina, another Napolitan house. There, for about twice the price you will experience a bit more taste in a new Italian stone and stucco villa. The Vault in Bordentown, NJ, also turns out a nice pie in a converted bank. \n\nAfter trying these and more, I find them a nice alternative to my first love, Jersey Tomato Pie. Always good to have a change of pace comfort food close at hand.",

It was a jumbo sammy, jammed with enough for at least two people, it's contents cut into bite size pieces of sausage and smaller virginized pepper & onion. The roll was a little soft due to being housed in one sided aluminum paper which trapped all the moisture inside, but even so it was an enjoyable lunch experience. \n\nI managed to consume half before my warning lights alerted me to reaching overfull capacity.

I walked in and saw the counter to the right with about 9 spinners, and several tables to the left.  The space seemed well occupied for 8:00 am, but what was obvious was the amount of conversation going on.  Everyone was engaged, not just with their own table, but with the rest of the house.  This was a very friendly joint.  \n\nI sat at an empty stood next to a woman who I had never met.  My coffee arrived before I could ask for it.

I always appreciate getting more and paying less.  I was hooked.  \n\nTurned out that the French Toast was excellent, with a touch of Vanilla in the mix and nicely caramelized edges. The Sausage Patty was exceptionally fresh and tasty without being greasy.  The Scrambled needed a touch of Louisiana Hot Sauce to make it sing, but the well used bottle was quickly brought to me when I asked if it was available.  \n\nI had a long chat with my stoolmate and learned about her family, work, and plans for life.  She told me: \"This place is like family.  Everyone knows your stuff and wants to help, if needed.\"  There is even a doctor who shows up almost daily and hangs his shingle while eating breakfast.  That's amazing!  No extra charge for a diagnosis with your pancakes. \n\nCaf\u00e9 Ferraro is a great little place.  If it was closer to home, it would quickly join my breakfast rotation, but given geographic realities, it will remain a treat for those rare mornings when I don't have to be standing in front of a judge at 9.",

    "text": "FresCafe Food Company is a new Lahaska breakfast/brunch/lunch cottage in the Earl's Restaurant complex. It is in Nancy's old place, but with fresh coat of paint to bring out the country shine. It is a little hard to find, but if you use Earl's as a guide you will find it by parking there and walking into the courtyard. First you will see the blue umbrella outdoor seating, with the main doors to FresCafe just beyond. \n\nLike most of Lahaska, it is an attractive countrified touristy house made to appear 18th Century village, with plenty of large trees, exposed beams, period artistry and wagonloads of charm. It is well done, and somewhat representative of the history of the area. Big windows and low ceilings with views of brick and aged board contributing to the comfortable atmosphere. Coming midweek avoids the crowds and allows for a leisurely morning cuppa joe and traditional repast. Service was attentive and friendly, but left me alone except to ask if I wanted more coffee or needed anything. Just the way I wanted it.\n\nThe Brioche French Toast was fine, topped with sliced straw and blueberries. A bit more vanilla extract in the egg mix would have enhanced the flavor, and an option for real maple syrup would have taken the dish to another level altogether. For a farm to table kind of place that would have been a strong move. Still, the coffee was decent and the overall experience quite positive. \n\nThere is a premium paid at all Lahaska establishments and FresCafe is no different. Still, the quality/price proposition is not out of line with the rest of town, and if you like these type of destinations, you will be pleased with this one.",

    "text": "Those who know and love tomato pie are aware that Trenton, NJ, has some of the best around. So, when a tiny take out shop in Penndel, PA, calls itself, \"Trenton Tomato Pies\" it has a lot to live up to. It has to be damn good to justify its name. Yet, because the pie can't be immediately consumed, it has an inherent disadvantage to those restaurants that allow you to eat it right out of the oven when the molten disk is nearest perfection and at its most dangerous. \n\nSo, I knew it was a challenge for these folks to succeed. I admired their courage and willingness to make the effort. I decided to stop in without advanced ordering to avoid any possibility the pie and sandwiches would be sitting around any longer than necessary for me to grab everything and get home as quickly as possible. \n\nI ordered a small Tomato Pie, Cheesesteak w Hot Peppers and Hot/Sweet Sausage, Pepper & Onion, w Hot Pickled Pepper sandwiches. I waited in my car about 25 minutes until everything was done, and drove the 15 minutes home. In the car I opened the pizza box to let steam escape to preserve crispness, and partially unwrapped the  cheesesteak for the same reason. The aroma was terrific and set off my glands' anticipatory reaction. \n\nSquirt...!!!\n\nHow was everything?  Glad you asked. \n\nWell, despite my best effort to protect the crunch, the pie had lost some of its bite and much of its heat. It was still good, but I had to use my imagination as to how much better it would have been if eaten sooner. The thin crust had good flavor, the under layer of mozzarella was light and not overpowering, and the crushed tomato top spread across its body was mildly sweet and acidic. These guys knew the secret recipe, just too bad they didn't have an adjoining dining room. \n\nThe Cheesesteak was decent, but not upper echelon, and the Mixed Sausage Pepper & Onion was actually pretty good, and more tasty than the steak. They seemed to be made from different rolls, with the later superior to the former in texture and taste. Can't explain that. \n\nBottom line - Trenton Tomato Pies is a very good choice for your Italian menu, depending in large part on the travel distance until consumption, or your ability to reheat in your oven prior to first chomp. I suspect they are waiting for the vape shop next door to close so they can expand and have the dining space they so sorely need to jump up in rank and play with the tomato pie big boys.",

    "text": "When friends called unexpectedly and told me they were at Karla's for dinner and drinks, and invited me to join them, it was very easy to drop what I was doing and make the 20 minute drive from Newtown to New Hope.  I hadn't seen one of my old friends for some time, and Karla's has been a very nice institution in New Hope for more than a decade. \n\nParking is always an issue in this river town, but in winter it becomes possible to find a spot off Main Street and a reasonable (and healthy) walk to whatever destination you have in mind.  It was a cold Friday night, and while the streets were empty of most pedestrians, Karla's was packed with customers in each of their historic and well appointed rooms on its multi-leveled layout.  I found my friends sitting in a far corner at a deuce, and the staff was kind enough to find an extra chair, fit me in, and provide me with a menu, although my friends were far along in their meals.  Even the neighboring diners were accommodating to my squeezing in next to them, and we all were able to enjoy the post-Christmas spirits.  \n\nI ordered a Lemon Drop Martini and the Mahi Mahi Sliders - a light repast. Five minutes later the drink arrived, properly mixed and very refreshing.  Normally, I would take a pre-sip photo for Yelp, but on this night I didn't feel like waiting for the phone cam.  I took a long sip, and then another. Very nice.  \n\nThe sliders arrived about 10 minutes later.  Three mini-burger bun sized sandwiches, with a nice chunk of Mahi, Lettuce, Red Onion shavings, and slightly spiced orange sauce, each complemented with a mini pickle lanced by a long wooden pick.  They were delicious.  Each component added subtly to the others.  The fish was fresh, and everything hung together and did not fall apart even after picking each up and holding it as I ate due to my distance from the table.  Thoroughly enjoyed them. My friends took bites and agreed.  \n\nKarla's is a place where the architecture, history, and ambiance of the space invites you to spend a long time savoring the experience.  Looking around it was obvious that everyone was having a good time with mostly larger groups of diners, and no one really wanted to leave.  Best of all, no one felt rushed.  \n\nJust a wonderful winter night.",

If you stick with the Chinese dishes, you should be quite satisfied.  \n\nWe came in for a Friday dinner.  The house was nicely appointed.  The service was attentive.  We ordered the Walnut Shrimp, Beef & Chicken Hunan and a Dragon Roll.  The shrimp dish consisted of 8 or 9 Jumbos, Tempura breaded, with a sweet mayo sauce covering the entire pile of crustaceans.  It wasn't the best I ever had, but was still quite enjoyable.  \n\nThe Hunan style beef and chicken was also well done.  This approach uses less straight ahead red chilis, and substitutes a mix of chili and black beans. It retains a lot of heat, but not the fire breathing kind.  The meat was tender and did not seem to have been frozen.  \n\nThe Dragon Roll was only okay.  The small amount of fish within the construct of rice, avo, seaweed, etc., was not the freshest.  The ginger was colored orange, rather than the natural white, and the wasabi was likewise artificially dyed green.  Clearly, the sushi guy had gone to Sushi College and finished the basic course in slicing and rolling, but was not working with top ingredients.  \n\nMy friends enjoyed the chance to speak with management in Mandarin, and that seemed reciprocal.  Probably don't get many organically grown Chinese stopping in.",

    "text": "The Vault is housed inside an old bank building that has been renovated except for the remaining 'vault' complete with heavy duty safe door.  The high ceilings and windows easily remind of the days when banks testified to their success by using their depositors money to build grand edifices to their capitalist acumen.  These days our financial institutions are more often viewed with distain and mistrust, resulting in a more modest approach to their architecture, in which they all fundamentally look like fast food restaurants without the large menus in the drive thru.\n\nFortunately, the pizza created inside this now comfortable house is anything but what you find in most pie shops in the area.  This is a different animal.  Neapolitan style, meaning the focus is on wood burning ovens that reach over 900 degrees Fahrenheit, that completely bake and sear the dough inside of 90 seconds.  I stood and watched my Pie being made and then placed in the oven.  The crust turned brown and then scorched before my eyes.  \n\nThe upside of this is incredibly fresh crust that becomes an accompaniment to the toppings (Margharita), rather than the firm platform for them to rest upon.  The experience is more like eating a hot pita dipped in spicy tomato sauce, mozza cheese, and basil leaf.  It sort of turns the meal on its head, but once I understood what was going on, I really enjoyed this variant approach to pizza.  \n\nThe downside (such as it is) is only that if you have a firm belief that pizza should only be made one way-with a firm tasty crust upon which are placed fine ingredients to be eaten as one entity-you may be disappointed that The Vault's ingenuity takes tomato pie in a different direction.  You can actually tear off part of the crust and dip it into the toppings on the pie as you would salsa & chips. \n\nI'm not suggesting that Napolitan Pie can replace that better known approach to pizza making.  It just that when you feel like something just as good but a little different, The Vault is waiting for you.",

I remember hanging out here in the 80's when I was bartending downtown and had a night off.  They always had live bands, cheap drinks, and hot skirted bar mistresses.  Unbeatable combination. \n\nThen, I moved on and didn't return until last week.  30-odd years and it still looked exactly the same!  Still pumping the standard label suds, and baking a very good bar pie.  The crowd seemed older than I remembered, but then again, so was I.  Those guys cemented to the barstools were likely the same as had been the young dudes the last time I was there. Funny how we find our place in the world. \n\nAnyway, I was catching a late lunch and had less than an hour to shut the growl in the pit of my stomach, and get back for the next interview.  The servers were still muy attractiva, so I took a spinner at the end of the bar, ordered a pie and Redd's, while chatting up my collegial barkeep.  The pie arrived about 10 minutes later, cheese a bubbling, and the aroma of ripe tomato, garlic and sausage steaming into my face.  Tears came to my eyes.  Some things are just timeless.   \n\nThe Bar Pie is an interesting creation.  Larger than the \"personal size pizza,\" often found in the Nuevo-rias of the world, but smaller than the usual \"small pie.\"  This is a \"tweener,\"- big enough for two for a late night comfort food raid, but also small enough for a hungry person to consume solo.  It is about 3 regular slices from a large pie.  This one was very good.  Scorched bottom from the superhot oven, and almost molten topping when it arrived.  It cooled slowly, and while the first sliced required fork and knife to handle, the last couple of slices could be handled manually without insulated gloves.  It was crunchy, feisty, and delicious.  Plenty of Sweet Italian Sausage to sate the savage beast.  \n\nWhile perhaps, a step down from its brothers at JoJo's Tavern, Ivy still bakes a very good bar pie. Well worth the trip from a wider radius.  Knowing that it is so close at hand, and offering good grub, good prices, and good reveries, makes it a priceless and prized stop on the Trenton Pizza Train.",

The distance from 48th and Baltimore and my first home purchase may have been less than a mile distance, but the existential shift was immeasurable.  Regardless of on which side of the river I resided, the South Street Bridge stood as the connection between past and present, student and worker, freebird and taxpayer,  dreamer and doer. \n\nSo, when I return to the area for any reason, I feel compelled to reflect upon the passages in my life.  I drive by the old townhouse in Center City and consider my great fortune in being able to buy a home across the street from a warehouse and brownfield that soon became a beautiful park.  I cruise into West Philly to see what's new on campus on my way to the outer reaches of Balto Ave., and see how much better everything is now.  Even the Bridge itself has been renovated, and is no longer the rusty derelict I walked across so many times.  Like many things in life, its better days are now.  Hopefully, that is an indication of what lies ahead for all of us.  \n\nThere are times when the span may have saved my life after leaving a great concert at Irvine Auditorium, and running into some folks who did not take kindly to the company I kept.  There were other times that it offered warm greetings to a returning prodigal son after too long away from the cozy confines of my piece of West Philly. And, yes, there were times it felt like a prison gate or pirate ship plank I had to walk while suffering the anxieties of final exams, or broken hearts. \n\nI have said elsewhere that bridges hold a special significance for me. The South Street Bridge is one of the inner sanctum of spans between one life and another that enables me to feel life intensely as a continual passage on the roads (and bridges) of life.",

I had driven down this way many times and never seen it.  Very glad I finally did with Yelp help.   \n\nThe space is attractive with hushed lighting, dark tones, the sushi bar to the left rear, and booths and tables along both walls.  A half wall divides the shop and provides a modicum of privacy.  This is a \"fusion\" house in the best sense of the word.  They really do succeed at being equally adept at fish sculpting/rice molding, and Chinese cuisine.  Although I was alone and ordered a Cantonese dish (Beef Chow Fun), I could see and hear my neighbors enjoying their sushi rolls and sashimi.  \n\nNot that I wanted to eavesdrop, but although it was lightly attended when I arrived around 8 pm, they sat the three tables of customers right next to each other, making it impossible to ignore my neighbors.  It would be a plus should management recognize that spacing out the customers when possible would enhance to overall experience of the diners.\n\nMy meal was very good.  The broad Rice Noodles, thin strips of Beef, abundant Vegetables and quality Brown Sauce, made for a quite enjoyable repast.  I could only finish half of the large plate in house, and took the rest home for a second round.  The Green Tea served singly in a ceramic mug was also tasty and promptly refilled without charge.  \n\nService was professional. \n\nI'll be back to check out the Japanese side of the operation and trust it to be as good as my neighbors made it seem.  There is also a short Thai menu for those who favor those flavors.",

    "text": "At least once or twice while in town for the gem shows in late January, the family demands a dinner more in line with what we consider comfort food.  I may prefer to gorge on Indian, Mexican and Vietnamese cuisine, and my family goes along willingly. Still, I know with me working most of the day and leaving them at the hotel to play, they need something that is fun to eat.  BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse fills the bill.\n\nThe place is large and bustling.  Mixed group of people at dinner time, with the happy hour folks mingling around the bar, and those of us in for a meal scattered around either along the bright windows, or deeper inside where it feels cool and dark.  While fairly typical of the latest variant of the modern roadhouse, it does it very well.  I get to drink a few interesting local craft beers, and my son gets his favorite drink of all time - root beer.  Once he tasted it he was mellow the rest of the night.  I took a sip. Smooth, light, sweet, and chill.  It was okay that he had nearly a pitcher of it.  He would remember it for a lifetime.\n\nBJ's seemed to be about pizza and beer, and we saw no reason to stray far from their wheelhouse on the first visit.  2010 was our first sit down, and I still remember the deep dish pies as overwhelmingly thick and overloaded with terrific flavor and texture.  The BBQ Chicken Pizza was enough for 6 people, and the Flatbread Roasted Veggie and Goat Cheese a crispy, glorious treat.  We ordered both of these for the 3 of us, and ended up taking most of it back to the hotel for the next day. The following visit, we had a simpler design; one Flatbread Pizza, One Crispy Jalapeno Burger, Wedge Salad and Gourmet Mac & Cheese for the young man.  All very good, and less to take back with us.  We were a happy clan, especially after trying a Pizookie, their signature dessert.  If you love cookie dough, this is for you - baked cookie dough topped with Vanilla Bean Ice Cream and a square of Dark Chocolate.  It is one delicious hot mess.  \n\nSitting back here on the East Coast as I write this, I can still recall the total satisfaction from the experiences at BJ's.  It makes me dream of returning next year for more of the same pleasures.",

It was impossible not to notice how clean and organized this place was compared to where we had just been.  Better lighting.  Broader aisles.  Smaller space, yet nicely laid out.  \n\nStrong display of serving vessels and cooking utensils for both the home and professional kitchen.  Only thing it lacked was plastic chopsticks for restaurant use, so bamboo would not have to be wasted on a single use.  \n\nOverall, a good place for Asian cooking needs, and one to which I would gladly return.",

Their recent upgrade adds to its luster, and the newly engineered intersection makes it easier to get in and out with risk of bodily harm.  It is easy to miss the deli section in the white building next to the Exxon station, but try to stop in.\n\nVM has a deserved reputation among locals for hearty breakfast sandys and over-stuffed burritos, way above average lunch options (especially Cheesesteaks and Chicken Salad subs and wraps, and even decent fresh coffee. It is primarily a take out joint, and the parking is adequate.  The staff moves efficiently and knows what the regulars want.  \n\nThere is a bit of confusion as to who has jurisdiction over Village Market.  Although much closer to the center of Newtown, it is actually in Lower Make.  Don't let that squabble deter you from sampling their homemade menu.  But, if you have the misfortune of being pulled over for speeding on Rt. 513, the police who will be stopping you and issuing the summons are from Lower Makefield, so don't blame Newtown.",

As usual, Harry Betz was elbow deep in some repair and had to disengage before coming out to greet us and find out what we needed. His triage took about 10 seconds and he diagnosed both the obvious and hidden problems clearly to us.  Could he do the repair? Sans doubt.  Could he do it before tomorrow night, as son was leaving crack of dawn for New York State?  Oh, ye of little faith... Mais bien sur. \n\nMy son and I were relieved, and were out of the shop within 5 minutes ready for a stop at Rita's for a guilt free stress release celebration.  \n\nReturned the following evening before closing, and the bike was good as new, and much cleaner than when it entered.  \n\nI hear what the others are saying about \"service with a smile.\" That may not always come with the expert repairs and knowledge that a local biz is watching our backs in a crunch. Still, I am a fan of having a confident expectation of getting the job done right and on time. Besides, Harry is  way cool when you spend any time with him.",

It has all I need in so many varieties that I start to lose perspective and wonder if there really is one special soy sauce for the specific dish I want to prepare, rather than one of many that would do quite nicely.  Of course, I then search for a store employee to ask this question and he/she inevitably walks me down the aisle like a curator in a museum and pulls out a bottle and hands it to me with a look between bemusement and contempt that I didn't know what I was looking for.  Mea culpa!\n\nHaving spent a long time in Asia I know that this and other \"super\" markets exist there in much better condition and organization than Hung Vuong and the other big stores in the city.  There, they don't smell, they are kept clean, offer better packaging and more refrigeration, and actually sell a wide variety of western products you don't find here. I generally avoid those modern conveniences and shop the outdoor markets to find the specific item I want at the vendors who specialize in those things.  After all, I am a foreign traveler because I like the traditional ways of doing business.  \n\nThose outdoor or night markets are not to be found regularly around here, so I accept that Hung Vuong and its siblings down the street and in Chinatown, are as good as it gets.  Luckily, I enjoy the experience enough to make it all worthwhile. \n\nThese days I am working my way through all the bottled chili sauces to find the few I like best.  I should complete my research sometime around 2018.",

The new coffee house is located at the prime location directly across from the State House on West State Street, and situated in a walk down basement space that has been very nicely renovated into a subterranean cozy space. Plenty of exposed brick, wood and granite all around.  \nIt was obvious they were still getting set up when I walked down the steps, but I was greeted warmly and welcomed to their new enterprise.  They do breakfast and lunch and appear to have state of the art equipment, including point of service payment system that allows the customer to use the latest technology to cover expenses without the staff touching a credit card.  \nMy order was a simple Everything Bagel with Butter and Swiss.  While I did not ask for it toasted, it came out that way.  No problem, as it appeared to have been pressed by a Panini iron that flattened the bagel, but also slightly melted the cheese and butter, but not enough to create a leakage issue.  It tasted very good as I drove back to the office.  The coffee was from the Small World Coffee people, and was a satisfying brew. The bagel was a good bite.  \n \nIf this house can manage the flow of lunch customers in that small space, they have a great opportunity to do very well there.  This stretch of West State Street in Trenton is very attractive these days, inviting people to walk and take their pleasures as they stroll.  \n\nThe proprietors are accomplished in the food trade, with other shops in Pennington and the sushi bar at Trenton Social.  They know \"...Renton.\" \n\nBest of luck!",

    "text": "As an attorney who has appeared here on behalf of clients seeking to become United States citizens, I have witnessed both the good and bad of this important service of the US government. \n\nThe entire process takes too long from application to final examination and Citizenship ceremony, but that is not the fault of the good people who work here (except when furloughed because of a government shutdown). Most do their best to make the experience as positive as possible given that there are too few employees to cover the number of applicants.  The wait is generally under an hour to get into an interview or exam, and the actual face time with an examiner is under 30 minutes.  The questions are reasonable if the applicant has studied a little in advance, and the examiners tend to be patient and understanding of language and cultural differences. \n\nThe most important thing is to be prepared.  Be sure you have all your official documents in your possession, and have responded to all correspondence seeking more information.  You may need updated tax returns, or employment letters, etc., and be sure you have them.  Otherwise, there may be a need for a return visit. Review the information brochures provided for the form and content of questions.  It is very helpful to talk with those who have successfully completed the process because often the same questions are asked.  There is no shortcut to knowing basic American history and government structure.  Just memorize as much as possible, and be able to talk a little about some of the topics. \n\nMost examiners are sympathetic to your goals, and want your to succeed.  A few may be having a bad day, and when that happens you have no choice but to roll with the punches. \n\nBeing represented by counsel is not required, but is often a good idea as it helps greatly with preparation of documents and reviewing possible questions, and can provide a sense of security while waiting in the large waiting room, as well as when with the examiners.",

Their style is heavy on chopped steak, with plenty of whatever you want on it. They do not skimp. \n\nI walked in yesterday to discover a small building, recently renovated into the 21st Century, with a small order counter, one table, and a back kitchen behind a half wall that bisects the room. Easy to hear the banging and clanging on the grill as the beef is torn asunder and plied with cheese, onions, peppers and hot sauce for constructing a Jay's Special. The roll was decent and able to hold most of the overload as long as it is wrapped tight and held on the horizontal until you get to where you intend to consume it. \n\nThat was my kitchen table. There was a little leakage on one end, but it did not escape past the outer white paper. The taste was strong, spicy and very satisfying. I could only eat half. \n\nJay's is definitely a strong choice if you know you want steaks, wings, wraps or hoagies. A pizza parlor it is not. They do a great job in the quantity/quality department, and offer prices that do not offend. It is a bit hard to locate in an older residential neighborhood, that clearly lacked zoning when it was built. Winding streets are fun to navigate, and when you arrive there is a special sense of accomplishment.\n\n Don't miss their food truck in the side yard, nor the outdoor seating on the rear patio.",

Rest assured that you are dining where travelers and locals have chowed down for more than 200 years.  Yes. The food is much fresher than that. \n\nI stop in occasionally for lunch or a late evening refresher with friends.  The bar is where I accomplish both.  As a former tender, I enjoy the tight confines of the long narrow room and excellent old bar.  Yesterday, I came in for a late lunch and sat at a high top along the wall.  A couple of old dudes sat at the bar chatting up the bartendress, so I basically had the room to myself.  I ordered their 10 oz. Saloon Burger with American, Red Onion, Lettuce on a Roll; Medium please.  It came out slightly beyond the midpoint, but still quite good.  The grill marks were pronounced, as was the taste of the hot steel.  The accompanying Fries were crisp, with a mix of those small overdone pieces that I love to crunch.  My attempt to reduce calories has me eating only half the roll, so the larger than usual burger was more than enough for a satisfying lunch.  \n\nThe price points on most dishes offered in the afternoon are between $8 and $12, with their burger coming in at $9.  \n\nReally a nice spot for a quiet lunch, and a good night spot for a drink and conversation.

Now there are breweries, cafes and a few real good places for the morning repast within blocks of each other.  If Mt.

The Roll was not quite a crusty baguette, but was fresh and complementarily soft and chewy as the palette on which the other flavors were painted.

If old school bowling is your thing, then this is a wonderful place to indulge yourself. The lanes are old, but full of families and leagues throwing strikes and spares, while the small tavern down the hall, pours suds from mostly well known national brands, and uses the kitchen in back for better than your average bear's bar grub. The dining area was full of groups playing cards on St. Patrick's Day, with most folks garbed in green. \nI sipped on my Coor's draft, watching the NBA as I waited for my order of pierogi to be served. The friendly barkeeper was more than happy to change the channel to the game, as nobody else seemed to be interested in the NASCAR race showing on all the screens. Not even the grumpy dude sitting next to me at the bar seemed to mind. I guess there was enough green in my Eagles Super Bowl LII hat to satisfy him. \nAnd, those pierogi were as good as advertised. Moderately chewy doughy dumplings stuffed with mashed potatoes and topped with a motherload of saut\u00e9ed onions. They appeared to have been boiled and then fried in a pan, as the surface was browned and crisp on the surface, and tender within. The plate was heavy on the crude oil, but that added to the overall homestyle flavor. Delicious. \n\nBest of all, the prices were reasonable. 8 ounce draft plus decent snack for just over $10., is quite the deal. \n\nAlthough rather old, there did not appear to be any access issues, as everything was on the ground floor with sufficient space for assisted walking or even the private medical chariot.",

I am glad I finally made it, and that it is now closer to home.  \n\nThis is a modern version of the old style small town luncheonette that was prevalent across the USA in the early and middle part of the last century.  It is more than a simple place to have a good meal, but also the unofficial town center, where people meet to discuss their lives, community and nation.  It has a warm and comfortable Americana feel to it.  I enjoyed my first visit sitting in a booth behind two senior gentlemen who were doing movie reviews and political analysis at a fairly sophisticated level.  At least 75 each, they gave nothing away to younger minds.  \n\nThe service was solid with timely walk bys asking if I wanted more coffee.  My French Toast was above average, but not among the best I have had.  The java was hot and tasty.  \n\nIf there is a weak link in Maryanne's armor it might be the way they approach providing the accompaniments to the dishes served.  Their syrup came in a small plastic cup.  It seemed to be watered down to be just maple sweetwater, rather than anything close to authentic commercial grade maple syrup.  It was completely soaked up by the bread because it lacked the viscosity to sit atop the short stack long enough to allow for cutting and consumption.  It made for soggy French Toast half way through the meal.  I would gladly pay extra for the choice of syrups.  The butter was likewise very thin and airy and had little buttery taste.  \n\nMaryanne's could be a real HOME run if they decided to provided an upgrade to these items, or at least the choice to patrons.  Their prices are very reasonable for the clientele, but even folks on Social Security enjoy a little pampering now and then.",

    "text": "Walking into Ted's Montana Grill in Warrington, Pa., (its only location in the Commonwealth), reminded me of my first visit to the Short Branch Saloon in Steamboat Springs, Colorado. A very long bar backed by mirrors and multi-leveled bottles of liquor, tiled barroom floor, small dining areas spaced around the rest of the building.  Tight booths for couples and foursomes with high back benches to maximize privacy. Cowboy and Rocky Mountain accents. Wood beams, floors and paneling everywhere. The only thing missing were the spittoons on the floor at the ends of the bar. With fond memories of those western days, I immediately felt nostalgic, while my expectations rose quickly. \n\nWe were seated toward the rear of the house, in a booth out of sight of the bar.  We were about the first to dinner. The table top was covered with a paper map of the Bitterroot Mountains.  It was an early rendition and suitable for framing. We were in the mood for burgers and sandwiches.  We realized that we were in luck because Ted's specialized in beef and bison burgers, along with a few interesting chicken options.  Steak was also on the menu, but this was more an exploration of the lower ridges without the urge to climb to Trapper Peak.  \n\nWe went with a Naked Bison Burger, Red Rock Chicken Sandwich, and The Z Bar Chicken Sandy.  All in the $13-14 range.  When the platters arrived our eyes widened at the sight of three well stacked dishes housed in interesting Rolls, Cheese, Onions, Shoestrings, and a sideload of French Fries.  The set up contained steak knives - a reasonable concession to the reality that there was no way to put these big brazen Buffalos in our mouths full bite.\n\n All three meals were really good; the Bison being the most anticipated and enjoyable.  I knew that buffalo meat was more tender, leaner and sweeter than its bovine cousin, and this held true for this humdinger. It was large, loud, juicy and delicious. The Red Rock and The Z were also solid cluckwichs and very enjoyable, but much more in line with past experiences.  No knock on them, but Billy Bison stole the show, naked and proud. \n\nWarrington isn't in our hood, but we do get to Doylestown with infrequent regularity.  Ted's Montana Grill will go on the short list of worthy stops on the way down from the mountains.",

I returned for lunch last week and found a packed house full of luncheon moms and summer break kids enjoying their freedom sharing a pie without adult supervision. Good for them!\n\nI found an empty booth under the \"roof,\" and ordered an eggplant parm sandwich.  It arrived about ten minutes later, steaming hot.  My approach with scalding sandwiches is to attack with knife and fork, rather than attempt to pick it up and take a dangerous bite. \n\nThe eggplant was nicely breaded and saut\u00e9ed in olive oil prior to being loaded into the Italian loaf and finished in the oven to melt the cheese and toast the outer edges.  There was enough tomato sauce on top to keep everything moist and tasty.  The gravy was a little salty, but that was not a big deal. The eggplant was soft and tender and mixed well with the sauce and cheese.  Saving the bread for last, it was very good - crunchy and tasting of all the elements that had been within. The surprise of the show! \n\nI can see why people enjoy Originals and keep it jumping. The atmosphere is communal and neighborly.  My lunch was far better than average. Fair prices. Good service.  Great for kids to ride to on their bikes.  \n\nA keeper.",

    "text": "Duck Sauce pioneered Asian Fusion (Chinese foundation) in the Newtown area.  The facility is dark and comfortable, and the staff is friendly and attentive without being overbearing.  Management is stellar, with the proprietress, Amy, warmly greeting everyone with a warm smile and sparkling eyes. \n\nThe food is a few notches above standard Chinese fare, while also providing a taste of Thai cuisine for the more adventurous.  The dishes are nicely plated and presented individually to satisfy both your visual and aromatic sensibilities.  The tastes are unique and you always feel the extra thought put into the creation of your meal.  \n\nLunch comes in at about $10 per, while dinner moves up to about $15.  Not bad for the quality and ambiance of the overall experience.  \n\nEveryone's taste buds are different, but I just had the Beef with Chinese Eggplant in a Basil Soy Sauce that was very good.  The Wonton Soup came with thin skinny wontons as well as spinach leaves, making for a mildly sweet sensation. White, brown or fresh made fried rice are all available with every meal.  \n\nFunny, I just returned from China and this was my first Chinese meal at home.  I found myself wondering why I was given a glass of ice water and western utensils when my Chinese eating companion had no water nor fork and knife.  I had to ask for chop sticks. This is only a small peeve, but perhaps it would be better to ask the patron if they want ice water or hot water and chop sticks or knife and fork rather than assuming from appearance what those answers will be, especially when the other diner is automatically given the Asian settings.",

I have stopped in for a quick meal now and then when going to/departing these halls of justice over many years. Although the name used to be Gus's, it still looks and feels the same.\n\nIt is old school. It slings traditional breakfasts and lunches for the courthouse and state worker crowds, and keeps quality, creativity and price in balance for the limited time and budget restraints of their market. It does this well, as can be seen by the full house at lunch and the empty seats after about 1:30.\n\nMy Chicken Salad on Rye Toast was a decent sandwich. Fresh ingredients. Good bread. The side of fries was okay and the thimble cup of sweet slaw pretty tasty. At around $8 with tax, it was a fair deal.\n\nThe Turkey & Swiss was likewise a solid lunch, as was the Chicken Salad & Bacon Melt I had last week. \n\nOwnership is in the house and involved in everything. They keep the house friendly and  check in with customers.  \n\nIt's good to have a reasonable and reliable luncheonette as a neighbor.",

    "text": "Just returned to Duck Sauce after an absence of more than a year.  It remains the dark wooded small dining room with booths around the walls. The teapots are still heavy metal with better than standard tea.  The menu does not appear to have changed at all, and that was a small disappointment.  \n\nHowever, the Pan Seared Pork Dumplings were well made, held together, and were very tasty.  I asked for a side of Hot Sesame Oil to bring up the burn, and poured it directly into the Soy/Vinegar Mix they dispense with this dish.  With that, it was very enjoyable.  Too, the Teriyaki Salmon was a nice size steak and was grilled just enough to leave it thick and juicy with a glowing glaze.  The golden yellow Mango surrounding the salmon was both ripe and sweet and a great color combination.  I was happy with both dishes.\n\nDuck Sauce is still a solid \"Fusion\" house, and the best Newtown currently has to offer.  It does feel a bit stuck in the 90s, and could use a makeover in terms of ambiance and offerings.  It will not satisfy the more sophisticated pallets accustomed to authentic Chinese, Japanese or Thai cuisine, but it does turn out tasty plates that are enjoyable for what they are.  \n\nI know where to go when I desire serious Asian food.  But, when I am not in the mood for a longer ride, and the comfort of home is appealing, Duck Sauce still provides the mood and flavor that keeps me satisfied.",

Well, Golden Nugget is where you go if you want to be rid of it, or to get more of it.  Either way, this outdoor market along River Road south of Lambertville, NJ., is a cultural trip down memory lanes and forgotten trails.   \n\nWhen I stopped in this week it was after heavy rain and the gravel  trading area was pretty muddy.  Still, I was able to drive in and park behind the market and take the steps down to the action.  At 8:30 am, the place was busy with the gypsies, mountain men, pickers, and collectors who are addicted to finding obscure gems in a mountain of trashy throwaways.  It must work for most regulars, because many are there three times a week to search, bargain and barter for those old tools, keys, buttons, knick-knacks and the most esoteric tchotchkes that are precious baubles to them. Why was I there?  My hunt involves old pocket knives.  They don't need to be sharp, but they do need to open and close, and have all their blades.  I found several around, but only purchased one that was fairly valued after friendly haggling.  The others were nice, but too dearly priced for my blood.  Amazing what excellent handicraft attaches to American steel.  Secondly, I look for beautiful beads to use in making jewelry that has been a small business for many years. Strung with pearls and other natural stone stringable pieces, make for interesting and attractive neck or wrist ware.  \n\nI'm not in love with Golden Nugget, nor the other similar flea markets in the area, but every now and then I have an urge to explore these backwaters of the American economy to see what I can find on the worn out tables in the park.  \n\nWho knows?  Maybe I'll get lucky again.",

Once a week I go for a couple of slices (tomato pie and traditional eggplant), and never fail to run into someone I knew in the same frame of mind needing a pizza to brighten our day. The few times I was there for dinner, I had a parmigiana or aglio olio pasta dish. Satisfying.\nThe downside has been that the shop is small and not comfortable enough for extended dining.  Too, in winter when the door opens, everyone is greeted with a cold blast, which chills both the patron and the food.\nThere are other pizza options in Newtown, and I frequent most of them.  They are all decent, if not attaining the Trenton nor Brooklyn pizza pantheon. But, who can travel to those places every time you crave a T.pie?  Right now, Marcos offers me the most positive \"Pizzaxperience\" in town.",

    "text": "Although Metro Diner doesn't originate around here, it fits right in with all the other dinners that have been in Bucks County for decades. It doesn't mimic the stainless facsades of yesteryear, but has its own style and comfort. More brick and glass with paint on glass stenciled sign windows proclaiming their most popular items (Chicken & Waffles, Chicken Pot Pie, Fish & Chips, etc.), and only a short counter with fewer than ten stools, the booths and tables are where most eating takes place. \n\nOn this weekend I was in the mood for something different for me, and asked for their chicken pot pie. I sat at the counter overlooking the kitchen and enjoyed the small talk among the cooks and servers. \n\nI watched as my dinner was removed from the oven, put on a large plate, passed from the kitchen to the dining room though a window with shelves to facilitate transfer from one to the other. The wait person placed before me a huge biscuit crust covered oval dish, browned on top and steaming at its edges. How attack this enormous package? \n\nI cracked open an end with my fork, lifted the corner of the crust and folded it back on itself. The aroma of the creamy thick sauce, full of vegetables and chunks of chicken wafted up to greet me. Seductive. I tasted a bit of crust. It was a fresh biscuit flavor, not too flaky, with a slight saltiness. The veggies were firm, the chicken, tender. It was all together terrific. Not that I am a pot pie maven, but this was the best I've had. In another house without the name \"diner\" attached, and with a good bottle of Pinot, this meal would be a star of the show and cost much more than the $10 it demands here.\n\nThe fried chicken looked appetizing, too. If as engaging as its potted cousin, Metro could become a habit.",

I am usually averse to \"outlet world\" experiences, as being over the top gross commercialism, that no longer reflects the factory overrun and slightly defective merchandise where the concept began; but is now part of the corporate master plan to produce specifically for sale in this setting. Too, so often there is no real saving going on, but only the false perception of discount. \n\nCertainly, I saw some of that in the Michael Kors Armani universe. But, surprisingly, other shops provided some true value. Calvin Klein had many casual shirts available at good prices, as did Banana Republic with their slightly eccentric styles. My biggest score was in Columbia Outdoors, where their outerwear was discounted up to 60% from the real online catalogue prices I had seen the day before. Picked up a really nice water resistant green vest and some camping gear. \n\nThe quasi-village look of the the center was attractive. Plenty of surrounding parking, wide walkways throughout, enough directories to keep from getting lost, and a few food outlets for when shopping no longer overcame hunger. \n\nYelp-wise, not every store was listed separately, making check ins and reviews impossible for we addicts who need to record our every move. That will hopefully take care of itself eventually. \n\nNonetheless, Gloucester Premium Outlets proved worth the drive and a pleasant consumption experience.",

Those folks are mostly gone now; replaced by the next wave of immigrants who prefer their corners to provide spicy sustenance along with the cervesa. Tropical Family fills that need for the Puerto Rican pallet. \n\nI stopped here for lunch last week.  I was pleasantly surprised by several things. First, they have a nice size parking lot surrounding the premises. So much easier than searching for street space.  Second, the house is very well renovated with brilliant color and murals and new buffet table, making it one of the nicer Latin places in the city.  Third, the service was first rate and came with sincere smiles from the bilingual staff.  Finally, the lunch menu while small, offers enough comida authentica to still the savage beast.  \n\nMy Pernil Sandwich was loaded with Pork, Lettuce, Red Onion, and Mayo on a fresh roll.  The meat was tender and everything together was a fun munch.  I did find it a little lacking in the heat department, but the table Tabasco took care of that.  I also ordered a Refresco Mango - a blended ripe Mango with water and ice.  It was very good, but next time I would go without the ice to avoid the brain chill the came along with it.  \n\nTropical Family seems like a solid choice for dinner, too.

It is a pleasant converted mansion on the slopes of the eastern side of the Delaware River Basin.  My visits have always been at the bar for after work meetings and light socializing.  The crowd is forty and fifty-somethings; all well behaved.  The bartenders are excellent.  Noah remembered my face, if not my name, after an absence of at least six months.  Impressive.  \n\nLast night, my margarita had the right touch of Padron and Cointreau, and my friend and fellow court gladiator enjoyed his aged malt whiskey.  Behind us at the end of the bar, a mellow guitar vocalist played gently and sang from a decent list of soft rock standards. It was just enough to fill the gaps in our conversation, but seemed to disappear when we spoke again.  \n\nWe decided to have a bite at the bar, rather than score a table.  I asked for the Meatballs I had seen brought out earlier, and Sam went for the Tapas plate. My dish was excellent.  Tender, airy meatballs in a tart, garlic tomato sauce, sprinkled with dry Italian grated cheese.  I only skewered a few pieces of cheese, greens, mushrooms off his plate, but thought everything was fine, if not enthralling. \n\nSo, why four stars?  It has nothing to do with the quality of the house, the kitchen, nor the bar.  They were all fine.  Blooming Grove just isn't my cup of tequila.  I prefer a less well kempt, more outside the box, more diverse, kind of place.  It felt too tame.

The actual restaurant is also well laid out, and has very well trained staff running the place.  \n\nI ordered a late lunch there earlier this week, and was surprised by the level of friendliness and care coming from behind the counter.

That was only the second time a fast food joint had risen to that level of service, and the other occurred right down the road.  Must be something good in the water. \n\nMy Spicy Chicken Sandwich was good.  The breast was soft and tender as if never frozen.  Somehow, CFA chicken is always the most flavorful and chewable of all fast food cluckers. The waffle fries were crisp and plentiful.  Their dipping sauces are pretty unique, and my sriracha packets were a mix of that well known chili heat and a subtle Thai-like sweetness.  Tasted great on both the chicken and the taters. Of course, the hand spun shake was as cool and creamy as always. Went the way of plain vanilla, as the cookies and cream option would have clogged the straw.  \n\nGenerally, I like the breakfast sandwiches offered by Chick-fil-A more than their chicken, but I have to say the improved service here and the high quality of their menu is slowly making me a believer that they have something special going on.",

    "text": "I understand why so many people enjoy dining at Caf\u00e9 Michaelangelo on Bustleton Avenue in the Far Northeast, Philadelphia. While most customers are local to the area, we were coming down from Bucks County, and this Italian haven was just a few miles over the county line. \n\nIt doesn't look like much on the outside. A narrow parking lot separating the building from heavily trafficked Bustleton. The fa\u00e7ade a worn brown wood with narrow doors and confusing signs.  Still, we found our way in through the side entrance and walked into a small lobby, followed by a large glass-walled dining room with high exposed beam ceiling and vistas overlooking a back yard that was treed and green - more like a tree house feel, than a structure anchored to the ground. Although aging, it was very attractive. Positive first impressions. \n\nWe were seated at the first table in the dining room.  Although closest to the door, there was a half wall with trellis protecting us, and we soon forgot we were sitting on the edge. The menus were brought out quickly and we settled in to scour it for that evening's delights. While reading, we ordered a Stone IPA and River Horse Raspberry Tripel Horse Belgian-Style Ale. (You're wrong! I had the fruity beer, and my beautiful companion the very stout IPA.) We decided to go light. Fried calamari as a shared appetizer, and roast pork and Italian sausage sandwiches as our mains. Alina was our excellent server. She took very good care of us first timers. \n\nAlthough the calamari was almost exclusively cut into bands, with only one set of tentacles, it was quite good; especially the dipping red sauce which was spicily chunky and required a second helping. While I might not get it again, it was a fine vehicle for sauce delivery. \n\nThe sandwiches were both first rate. They were served on decent Italian rolls which supported their passengers from plate to mouth without hesitation or flopping. The meat was tender and flavorful, with dipping sauce to enhance the experience. The sausage was cut into smaller slices for ease of ripping off chunks of the sandwich, and had ample onions and green frying peppers mixed throughout and more of that wonderful red sauce.  Really liked both plates. And, there was a plentitude of stuffing in each - so much so that we could only eat half of each sandwich and brought the rest home for stepson to enjoy.  We had planned to order something separately for him, but we had so much that it wasn't necessary. Alina brought us the takeout containers and bags with an easy smile, despite the loss of the extra sale to the house. No doubt, she had seen this happen before. \n\nWe thoroughly and zestfully partook of our Caf\u00e9 Michelangelo meal, and commented as we ate how good it was. In warmer weather, eating on the back patio would be a worthy addition to the program. \n\nAn exceptional find on the wild streets of Bustleton. And, the prices didn't hurt either.",

    "text": "Elmwood Park Zoo is a 16 acre community zoological garden on the outskirts of Norristown, PA. As small zoos go, this one is pretty cool. It has maximized its diminutive size with a 24 hour a day schedule and state of the arts events that can make everyone from 3 to 93 entertained, at least for a while. \n\nFrom zip line through the treetops, to daily face to face animal feedings, to overnight camping with informative guide, Elmwood has it going on!  The late morning I was there to wait for my next meeting nearby, there were dozens of families with young kids walking around, interacting with the animals, and taking tours through this attractive, hilly landscape. Whether greeting Noah the Bald Eagle, or Stella the Horned Owl, the children were enthralled, and their parents happy to provide the family with an extraordinary experience. \n\nThe zoo is available for private parties, including weddings. Educational programs abound addressing conservation projects and endangered species. Cub Scouts to seniors have something to events geared to their age and ability to learn and engage. \n\nFounded in 1924 when the private owner donated the original land to the Borough of Norristown, and managed by the government until it became too expensive to maintain on taxpayer funds, and was reorganized as a non-profit in 1977 known as the Norristown Zoological Society. Through the 21st Century it continued to expand its size and services, including a master plan that built several pavilions  and large scale permanent exhibits, including the Kimmel Conservation Kingdom in 2001, its interactive playground where human and other species met to learn from each other. \n\nMore than 500,000 visitors come annually, most of them families participating in all the activities. It may be small in stature compared to the more famous Philadelphia Zoo, but pound for pound it provides more alternative activities than its older, Ben Franklin founded, sibling.\n\nDefinitely worth a visit or two.",

    "text": "Back in the day when I lived in the Fairmount neighborhood at 26th and Brown Streets, shops as good as Rybread didn't yet exist, and we walked to the local corner taverns for suds and a meal.  Now, this neighborhood has experienced a modest renaissance and has a good variety of kitchen alternatives within a few blocks radius.  Makes me think about what it would be like to live here again in the shadow of the Museum of Art and take advantage of all the improvements.  \n\nWe were showing out of town guests the beauty and grace of Philadelphia from the steps of the museum (so nice that on the weekend we could stop for a while right in front of the PMA and let our friends run up the stairs and enjoy the view without hassle).  When we agreed we were hungry, I searched Yelp for local restaurants, and saw Rybread in my bookmarks.  We drove there in about 3 minutes. Plenty of street parking. \n\nThere were no other customers when we arrived and we settled into the three small tables in the front of the shop.  One of the friendly servers explained that we should order at the cashier and we would be called when our lunches were ready.  Simple enough. There were five of us, and we wanted to sample everything that was selected.  They agreed to cut the sandwiches in quarters to accommodate.  \n\nThere were good looking scones in the display, and we impulsively asked for a blueberry and cranberry. Baked in house, both were excellent; slightly moist and mildly sweet.  Nothing wrong with starting with dessert.  We then went with the Savannah (turkey, brie, cranberry sauce and mayo on multi-grain bread), Lake Tahoe (tuna salad, cheddar, tomato on ciabatta-panini style), Napa (fresh mozza, roma tomatoes, pesto, balsamic glaze on grilled baguette), and Tucson (oven roasted turkey, swiss, red onion, chipotle mayo and tomato; ciabatta panini style).  A large size soup of the day (sweet potato, chicken) was thrown in for good measure. \n\nEach of the sandwiches was very good to excellent.  The bread fresh and brought to life through the panini press or just out of the bag.  The ingredients were fresh and ample.  No skimping on these works of art.  The soup was wholesome, hot and tasty.  We congratulated ourselves on our wise choices, and the good fortune of finding this charming, yet cramped, restaurant converted out of this block of row houses.  \n \nPeople came and went as we sat and ate.  Some came in, saw the indoor tables were occupied and walked out again. On this rainy day, the outdoor seating both front and rear was not a real option.  Still others, got their meals to go.  \n\nThe bill for the indulgent five of us was less than $50, with a few shared Joe's Iced Teas.  At that cost, the priceless chalkboard atmosphere was free.  \n\nWould love to return for breakfast, which is available before noon.",

    "text": "Viet Tokyo Cuisine is a new restaurant on Haines Road, Bristol, PA.  Its doors have been open about ten days, offering Pho (Noodle Soups) and Com (Rice Dishes) from the southern part of Vietnam as well as Sushi.  It is owned and operated by a lovely Vietnamese woman and gentleman who are anxious to please customers with authentic beef broth noodle soups with a variety of thin sliced beef,  meatballs, or chicken.  The environment is utilitarian with about six booths and a few tables around the single dining room.  Decorations are sparse, but the house is clean and the service is solid.  \n\nI ordered a bowl of their Pho Bo Tai (Round Steak).  For $8.95 I was served in a large square bowl of a decent beef stock, nest of noodles, and 8 - 10 thin slices of the rare steak that I separated with my chopsticks to allow each to finish cooking in the heat of the soup.  I added Thai basil, sprouts, jalapeno slices and lime juice to taste, and set out to work my lunch.  The noodles needed to be pulled apart, but that was easily done. The beef was very good, especially when dipped in a mix of sriracha and hoisin sauces. I could not finish the pho. \n\nFinding a pho shop in this part of Bucks County was a pleasant surprise.  While there are a few others around, they remain few and far between.  I found that the broth, while good, needed more time in the pot to simmer and reduce to a more complex spicy finish.  This is normally at least a 24 hour process, and this one was not quite mature. Still, I enjoyed it, as well as the labor of working the noodles, beef and consomm\u00e9.  That is one of the best parts of slurping pho. It can be such a hands-on experience. \n\nI will likely check Viet Tokyo out again to sample the rice options. It would be great if they also made Banh Mi sandwiches, but they were not on the menu.  Still, maybe they could do them as a special once in a while. If good it would guarantee my faithfulness. \n\n3.5 Stars. \n\nCan't speak to the sushi.",

Bonaparte would feel right at home.\n\nUnder The Moon dresses up like an old antique store that specializes in kitchen furniture and tableware.  It is wall to wall tubular steel tables and chairs and trundle tables.  The glassware and coffee mugs are a mix of various decades. The painted wood panel ceiling was attractive and interesting.  It was all so very charming and cozy. \n\nI was alone when I entered around 2:30 looking for a late lunch.  Kim greeted me with a big smile and told me to sit anywhere.  I picked a double mid-shop to have equal views forward and aft.  A run through the menu had me narrow my selection to an appetizer ($9), as the prices were above my self imposed lunchtime limit.  The Corn Souffle with Leaks sounded about right.  \n\nIt came with a few slices of home baked Garlic Bread, which itself had a small amount of Garlic Butter at the ready.  The Souffle was not large, but it was filling.  The consistency was appropriately like whipped egg, and the Fried Leek topping looked like gray straw left by a miniature farmer.  The taste was remarkable for the sweetness of the corn and the crispy onion salute of the Leeks.  I liked this ensemble very much.  The price no longer felt so cher.  All the while, Kim returned periodically to check on me and keep me company.  \n\nWhen done I was asked if dessert was a consideration.  I saw the options in the display near my table.  Everything looked over the top!  Still, sweets would have to await another visit as I had plans at night.  \n\nThe owners obviously take great pride in their establishment, and they have made an exceptional effort to stylize their house.  The food seemed to have a continental and mildly Spanish orientation.  No problem there.  The empanadas tapas were on my short list.  They were made in house by the mamacita or abuela. \n\nUnder The Moon is a great date.",

Served by the cook himself taking a walk from the grill to clear his head, it was the best half pounder I've had for quite a while. It was a perfect medium finish as requested. With lettuce, fat tomato slice and thin fresh red onion ringlets, the juicy flavor/texture was a masticating joy. Quality brioche roll, too. Crisp fries showed the small details were not taken for granted. \n\nBut for the fact that smoking is allowed, Murphy's was five star all the way. Have to add the expense of laundering the smell out of my clothes to the otherwise top drawer experience.\n\nMaybe, \"Beef & Ale\" really means it!",

So, I ordered the small 15\"er with Sweet Italian Sausage. \n\nThe shop is too tiny for tables, and I planned to take it home, knowing that it would be past its prime by the time I opened the box. To my surprise, although no longer hot enough to burn my tongue, it retained its point when lifted, and folded nicely between my lips and into my mouth. Nice char on the undercarriage, too. \n\nThe taste was good with slightly salty tomato slurry top, hint of basil and correct amount of melted mozza proportional to the sauce. It left a very good first impression. \n\nDef worth remembering the next time I'm in the Trenton Farmers Market zone.",

    "text": "I guess it means something that it took four years for a return visit to Duck Sauce, despite the fact that it is the closest restaurant to my Newtown office, and I love Chinese food. \n\nThe reasons are what you'd expect. It just isn't the exceptional Asian fusion it once was, and the competition in that niche has grown in the interim. It seems there has been a change in ownership, with the old kitchen creativity having lost its edge. While it remains better than average as a Chinese/American house, it really doesn't overtly compete in that space. Rather, it's claim to fame has always been that it is a different kind of Asian place - a fusion experience that suggests traditional dishes, but does them in a unique way to make their menu special. \n\nWhile the menu looks the same for the most part, the separation from standard offerings elsewhere is now less distinct; the distance between Duck Sauce and the average Chinois, smaller. \n\nThe Wonton Soup is still very good, but the wonton skin a bit thicker. The Calamari appetizer had a coarse breading that detracted from the softness and flavor of the tender crustacean beneath, while the dipping sauce was fine. The Orange Beef was soft rather than crispy, and the dark amber semi sweet sauce, thick and more gloopy than remembered. Yet, there were the potato sticks sprinkled on top, still a nice touch. The Shrimp and Cashew platter was very good, but not dissimilar to what you can find almost everywhere. \n\nI finished my lunch satisfied, but not in love with the meal, as I once was. It is still a good place for quality ingredients and presentations, but I left with no urge to return within the next four years. \n\n3.5 STARS",

They did not see the big shopping malls of the 20th Century as enhancing the land values that surround them, but were open to the concept in modern urban planning that recognizes that people prefer to have consumer experiences on a more human scale.  \n\nCapture the essentials of small town America in an attractive village-like setting, and they will come to spend money.  They got that right. \n\nThe Shops at Valley Square found the sweet spot for commercial enterprise for this era.  Buildings designed to look like a country town, with sidewalks, narrow streets, street parking,  buildings no taller than three stories, and attractive shops and restaurants that are as inviting on the outside, as they are within.  Include the brands that people want and the eateries that beckon their hunger for relief, and success is almost assured.  \n\nThe facility is very attractive and inviting.  We were there for dinner, and the choices were pretty good; Panera, Ted's Montana Grill, P.F. Chang's, Chipotle, and even a Wegman's if we wanted to take home.  It was easy to park near our destination, and fun to walk a few blocks to see what was going on.  \n\nNot every municipality shows the foresight to bring in such a sparkling center that has become a destination for the surrounding communities, and beyond.  \n\nHave a visit and enjoy the future.",

Yet, on their own, the pizza was solid, with good tasting mozza and fresh tomato sauce.  The crust could have been firmer, but I was in a forgiving mood.  At slightly more than $5 for lunch, this was a worthy pizza stop.  Too, Rosario's did not make a dozen pizzas in advance for display.  Their old style approach was appreciated, as I knew that whatever pie I was eating had not been made long before.  Just in time production works best for fresh food.  Those houses that leave pizza around all day for people to see and chose could learn from Rosario.

The space is small, adding to the sense that its bar and dining room are popular in the hood. Service is in the traditional black and white mode - all first rate. Our reservation options were for either 5:30 (too early due to work) or 7:45. We grabbed that table for three. \n\nThe menu had everything expected from apps to dessert. We opted to share the calamari frita with a Thai chili dipping sauce, followed by chicken franchais, chicken marsala and their pork chop plate. All were very good to excellent. The squid had a strong crunchy breading that was enhanced by the Asian style sweet/hot spice. It was a legit alternative to the red sauce that normally accompanies this dish. The two chicken platters were tender fillets with with custom made sauces. The mushrooms in marsala wine and the artichoke in lemon and white wine renditions were a joy. The pasta sides were a nice counterbalance in red dress to the subtleties of the mains. The pork chop was at least a two inch cut with demiglaze, string beans and mashed. That heavy serrated blade came in very handy. If there was any weakness at all, it was the chop was a bit tougher than it should have been. Still, the juicy taste was there, it just required more mastication than desired. \n\nWe had no room for sweets at the end. \n\nMetro Grill is an excellent representation of the Trenton Italian cuisinary tradition. It is proof that you can take the restaurant out of the Burg, while maintaining the Burg within the heart of the restaurant.",

And, that's the way I like it. \n\nThe dining room is dark and small with a bamboo grove potted by the door and soft wood and cool orange tints throughout. Management is Siamese and the chef was likely raised there, too. So, it is as authentic as it can be, while making understandable concessions to American taste buds. I was very pleased with lunch the other day, as it all seemed deliciously consistently Phuket. \n\nThe lunch deal consisted of an appetizer, soup/salad and entree, for $9.95. I was attracted to the Buddha Dumplings (veggie), Coconut Soup (veggie) and Drunken Noodles (chicken and hot). It was a combination that came at me in waves. First, the fried dumplings were full of ground veggies and a good dipping sauce. Pleasantly chewy with mild flavor. The soup was steaming and loaded with thin sliced carrots, string beans, mushrooms, tofu, with a slightly stronger spice bite than the B. Balls. Finally, the drunk pasta, while not the jumbo noodles expected, was still strong enough to use it surface to hold on to the heavy brown sauce tenaciously. It had a larger quotient of hot chili powder, and thus the strongest taste and plenty more veggie and sliced chicken. It was perfectly sized at less than a dinner portion, but more than enough to fill me up after all that came before. \n\nService was attractive, friendly and invisible except when delivering the dishes to the table. \n\nIt was great to be back in an authentic Thai house after recent exposure to \"fusion\" huts that couldn't deliver on the promise of real Pattayan cuisine. If their duck is up to the standards of the rest of the menu, 5 stars won't be far behind.",

    "text": "Pho Ben City (clever ref to Franklin City), sits on Rt 611 in Abington, Pa. It is a nicely reused former fast food outpost, that is now a well designed, modern Vietnamese house with a full menu from pho to com to full plate dinners.  Service is friendly and prompt. Prices are competitive with other local pho shops, but higher than found in cities north and south by a couple of bucks.  Higher rents in the burbs lead to higher prices.\n\nMy Phone Tai was good. The broth was clear and could have simmered longer before serving to bring out the flavor. The accompanying Thai basil, sprouts, jalapeno and lime were freshly bright green. Plenty of lean beef and needles lurking beneath the calm surface. \n\nThe roast pork Banh Mi was tasty, with nice crusty baguette holding it together. Spring Rolls were average for content and taste, while the dipping sauce was a little thin. \n\nComplimentary scoops of ice cream was a nice closer.\n\n Pho Ben City is quite good, but it does give away some of the strongest elements of Viet cuisine, perhaps due to location and clientele. I have no problem with that, but admit to liking the style used where most visitors to Saigon houses seek the full Monty of taste.  To my tongue, it is superior to Pho & Beyond (less MSG), and about on par with Pho Palace, if a little behind House of Pho in overall richness of experience.",

    "text": "Covid Takeout Review\n\nDid a GrubHub takeout from Shagun Palace yesterday, and was very satisfied with the result. The restaurant is in the rear of a shopping center on Street Road, Bensalem, where there is a significant cluster of South Asian kitchens. Competition being severe, the quality is higher than in many more isolated Indian houses. \n\nOur order: Veggie Samosa for an appetizer; Chicken Korma, Chili Chicken - Dry, as entrees; and Baingan Bartha (curry eggplant), for a veggie side; and Garlic Naan to soak up the sauces. The foods were all very good to excellent, with kudos to the korma and dry chili chicken, which displayed spice skill with the sauces. The bird was perfectly cooked, and not at all dried out. \n\nIf there was a weakness, it was the Naan, which appeared premade and merely heated in the oven before wrapping in foil. It was thicker and drier than normal, and not the least bit flakey, nor with expected air pockets. There was practically no garlic flavor. Next time, skip the naan. \n\nThere are talented hands at Shagun Palace where they are allowed to perform their magic. They are masters of curry cream reductions, but make a mistake in not carrying the expertise through to their breads. If they lack a tandoor for BBQ and Indian oven breads, they really should invest in one. It would make Shagun a more complete 5 Star experience.",

    "text": "Santorini is one of the most beautiful Greek islands in the Agean Sea. Shaped like a crescent, it is the geologic remains of an extinct volcano, creating a large harbor where the central vents were before collapsing beneath the sea. Houses are all whitewashed in the towns that cling to the cliffs above the sunken caldera. These days it is best known for its blue domed churches, and excellent cuisine. \n\nSo, naming a gyro house after Santorini makes sense, as it suggests a rugged land with equally tough people capable of great artistry in the kitchen. This new small Greek place is well appointed to feel like you are sitting in a caf\u00e9 in Kamari or Oia, the two main villages there. They have a limited menu, but their focus is on the traditional fare - gyros (the derivation of Heros), or sandwiches made with hot pita stuffed with well spiced meat, or veggies, i.e., falafel. \n\nThe shop has three vertical roasters for pork, lamb and chicken. A large electric shaver is used to slice off the meat from the central spit, before being loaded into the pita with tahini sauce, yogurt, onion, tomato, fries and paprika. The whole pita is then rolled snuggly around these contents, and wrapped in paper and again in aluminum foil, so it is served like a cornucopia on a plate. \n\nThe result - a delicious sandwich, requiring help from a fork to consume, because it is so filled to overflowing that each bite has some of it falling out onto the plate. Not that I'm complaining. \n\nThe gyro with a bottle of water was about $10 plus tax. The lamb is another buck or so. \n\nVery worth a stop if you like Greek street food in an attractive setting overlooking Santorini Bay.",

    "text": "If you don't mind paying $23 for a four pack of local suds, Newtown Brewery is a worthwhile destination for the yeast heads in the crowd. The facility is very attractive with plenty of wood and stone, and the beer is excellent for the most part. \n\nWe stopped in last weekend and the room was hopping. Tables full of folks escaping Covid captivity. But, we weren't ready for a space packed with over a hundred people without masks, nor social separation, so we bought our \"I lost My Marbles\" Belgian Tripel four can and headed home. Just didn't feel safe (and thus the one star deduction for lack of public awareness by management).  Under better circumstances, Newtown Brewing would be a big hit in these parts, and in fact, it appears it already is. \n\nThe beer was quite strong at 11% alcohol content, but the taste was great, and the color a robust rusty slurry. Liked it a lot. I'm no expert, but these guys seem to have the right recipes. \n\nThey do have a food truck in the parking lot most weekends, and we were fortunate to approach the window of Stuff'd Bunns and grab two sliders to partake with the ale at home. They were great and a perfect partner to the cold fermentation. More on them in a separate review coming soon to these Yelp pages. \n\nI hate to have to take out a loan to support my occasional beer addiction, but aside from that, and the insensitivity to the CDC guidelines, Newtown Brewery really enhances the neighborhood. Just hope no one gets exposed to the virus. That is a price far to high to pay for a momentary pleasure.",

    "text": "Bowman's Hill Tower sits in Washington Crossing Historic Park at a high point along the Delaware River where a most important part of the American Revolution was played out.  Construction was part of the Civilian Conservation Corp that put Americans to work during the Depression, and was completed in 1931. \n\nThe view from the deck 320 feet above river level is awesome.  Especially on a clear fall day, it is possible to see more than 12 miles up and down river, as far as Trenton to the south. The flowing river and changing foliage make for a strong memory. Certainly, Washington would have appreciated having such a tower to use to observe British activities approaching this location.   \n\nBut, it was not just patriots occupying these fields after the Continental Army was defeated by the British in New York, and Washington beat a hasty retreat through New Jersey into Bucks County to save his remaining troops.  Not everyone believed in the cause, and many of the locals actually supported England and did its bidding, including spying and behind the lines mayhem.  The infamous Moses Doan was in this vicinity as the plan for the Christmas raid on Trenton was put into operation.  He is believed to have crossed the Delaware just ahead of his hunters, and rode to Trenton to warn the Hessians of the coming attack.  But, for the fact that the German commander Rahl did not bother to listen to Doan, we might still be speaking with British accents. \n\nSo, Bowman's Tower is worth a visit, and while you are at it, spend a few hours searching the old homes and cemeteries in the Park.  From New Hope to Morrisville there is plenty of history to be seen.  \n\nThe ride along Rt. 32 is worth the price of admission alone.",

    "text": "I was last here when it was known as the Old Neshaminy Tavern about a year ago. Since then it has adopted the \"Brewery\" tag, and taken advantage of the Pennsylvania law that allows local breweries to manufacture their own suds, and sell the products of other Pennsylvania breweries (only) with special dispensation in taxing and licensing. Smart move, as the name is attractive, the kitchen remains solid, and they now have many beers, ales, IPAs, and other interesting fermentations for your drinking pleasure. \n\nThere is a large chalk board on one wall with a listing by number of what is available. Those numbers correlate to taps behind the bar with numbers above each. Call out what you want by name or number, and the gracious bartender will pour it for you. About half come from their own stainless vats, while the remainder are what management thinks is noteworthy from around the Commonwealth. Of course, if you want a national brand, some of those are available in bottles or other taps. I chose the Neshaminy Creek Churchville Lager, a well made semi-dark pilsner from right down the road in Penndel. Loved its dark amber color, and the corresponding flavors of black coffee and chocolate. \n\nI also ordered their Trenton Pie and side of Brussel Sprouts. They were both very good. The pizza was true to its name, with thin crust, Marazano tomato chunks on top and mozzarella underneath. The Brussels were plentiful, and would have been better with a tossing of vinaigrette in addition to the bacon pieces to give them more bite. Took most of both home after sampling some at the bar as I enjoyed my lager. \n\nLanghorne isn't known for its local attractions, but it does have a few interesting points to visit. Langhorne Brewing Company adds to that list of worthwhile destinations in this part of Bucks County.",

With large umbrellas and heating towers, it is a pleasant place to have a late lunch on a chill Saturday afternoon with the sun casting it's golden hue. \nThis is a great place to enjoy the Borough of Perkasie, a tight community in northwest Bucks. \n\nI sat with the sun at my back and ordered a Blue Moon draft, French Onion Soup and Sauteed Pierogi from their appetizer menu. I also asked for takeout of Crab Cake and Chicken Parm sandwiches for my working family. \n\nThe beer was served in a soft plastic glass with orange slice split over the rim. Cool and refreshing. The beef broth and translucent onions were very good once I pierced the thick layer of melted provolone that sealed the steaming contents of the of the potage d'oignon gratinee. Liked it alot. The pierogi arrived in a styro container. There were four homemade potato pasta pockets that had been sauteed in butter and thin sliced browned onions. These were excellent, and I would have loved if there were one or two more in the box. Still, it was an appetizer, not an entree, so I understood they were designed more as a delicious tease than main course. \n\nLast night, my wife and stepson came home to the crab cake and chicken parm. After a short reheat I sampled both and found them to be superior sandwiches. The crab cake was fresh, sweet and housed in a brioche roll. The parmigiana was a thick chicken breast, well breaded, with a decent red gravy and melted cheese. Very good. Both came with house deep fried potato chips. Nicely done. \n\nThe Perk is an anchor establishment in Perkasie, and well worth the travel from home to stop in now and then. If we lived closer, I would no doubt be a regular.",

The business opens at 8:00 AM, not the 10:00 reflected on its Yelp page. As we were there for breakfast, the earlier time is important to know. \n\nWe ordered two egg platter breakfasts. Both had two fried eggs (ordered over easy, but delivered sunnyside up), five slices of small loaf toasted sweet bread, and bacon/sausage.  In addition, we had excellent coffee and shared a marble donut made for us after ordering. Service was friendly, informative and nicely paced. \n\nTurned out that the egg/meat/toast part of the meal was pretty ordinary, with the only remarkable piece the pleasant taste of the bread. Much more interesting and rewarding was the strong java brewed through an expresso machine, and the donut.  Expresso coffee was used, which made for a rich, aromatic joe. The donut was still warm from the oven and covered in a thick icing of vanilla and chocolate. Delicious, but not too sweet. A super pleasant chew. \n\nI would return to enjoy more baked goods and coffee, and likely pass on the breakfast offerings.

When it comes to dual production, you have to hope that they maintain adequate separation of ingredients and recipes, so the pizza doesn't start tasting like bagel, nor the bagel too much like tomato pie, particularly in the crust and toppings departments. \n\nLuckily, that doesn't seem to be an issue, as, while I only tried an onion bagel (w Veggie Spread), it did not remind me of a slice O' pie. \n\nYet, perhaps there was some leakage in style.

I much prefer a harder skin from boiling with lye for about 40 seconds. When that doesn't happen, the outer coat is more like ordinary loaf bread, and not the tougher exterior that epitomizes the true rounder. So, while I liked the chomp, it would have been so much better if it had required a stronger, sharper bite from my incisors. \n\nIt wasn't a bad bagel, but done right, it could have been a real contender. \n\n3.5 STARS.",

Rojo Roasters is one of the early movers, and found a great old industrial site on far North Union Street in Lambertville, NJ, to set up shop. The place is cozy with strong Joe, laid back jazzy sound, and a reputation for well respected coffees. Half the shop is given to java mavens, and the other to making the beans morph from green to dark brown. The aroma can be overpowering. The regular customers seem well entrenched.\n\nYet, this inherent strength can also be a hidden weakness. A bit of sampling from the nearby competition leads to the realization that Rojo is strong in some areas, but weak in others. Because they are limited to their sources, equipment and process, there is a sameness to their products. When in the mood for powerful coffee, it is top of the mountain. All their beans and drinks are on the harsh side and lack subtlety. Reminds of Starbucks, and that is not necessarily a good thing. \n\nThe other houses offer Rojo and other local, regional and national companies. It allows them to select the best of breed from across a broad spectrum of styles and technical processes. Thus, when you want something milder, or perhaps, nuttier or fruitier, you can get it alongside the stronger Rojo label. \n\nYet, Rojo does what it does very well, and has a large following. Too, their bakery goods are first class. Loved the blueberry lemon pound cake this morning. Moist, dense, dark blue delicious. \n\nWe are in a buyers' coffee world these days. It pays to sip around and discover what you like most on any day of the week. Chances are you will find it close at hand.",

The Onion Bagel was as the first one - not quite crunchy enough.  Still, it was fresh and tasty, and at a great price of under $4. for the bagel and decent Jamaican Blue Mountain style java.  \n\nEasy to become a fan of this comfy chill.",

    "text": "Donuts Plus (exactly what the \"Plus\" is, is a secret), in the 4300 block of Chestnut Street, West Philly, sits in a rather inappropriately placed strip center in the middle of a heavy urbanscape. To look at it passing by you wouldn't think that this tiny shop cold possibly compete with the better known fry-dough emporiums around town.  But, the truth is that although it doesn't \"cock-a-doodle-doo,\" its own rooster, it has the magic recipe for excellently addictive donuts.  We stopped four people along the way to ask directions, because the walking GPS seemed confused. Everyone thought we wanted a Dunkin, and hadn't heard of this joint, until we encountered a security guard who knew exactly where we were looking to go, and provided solid directions.\n\nThe space was tiny upfront where you place your order through heavy plexiglass and small defensive windows, but the folks behind the barrier possessed winning smiles, and the assurance of knowing they were very good at what they do.  \n\nWe walked in after a meeting at USCIS nearby, looking for some sweet cheer and caffeine.  The cast of characters hanging around inside was loud and maybe even slightly bizarre, but they stepped away from the window and allowed us to do our business.  We ordered an apple fritter, a couple of old fashioned honey dipped donuts and two javas. A small handwritten sign said, \"Donuts $.95 each.\" We paid cash and returned outside to enjoy the beautiful spring day in February, and stroll back to the car a few blocks away.\n\nThe dough boys were simple and delectable. Firm outside. Soft inside. Sweet layer of skin. These were yeasties, not the cake d-nuts found elsewhere.  The fritter was huge, but too oily for complete enjoyment.  The other two were simply a pleasure. The coffee was a mild brew, and easy going down.\n\nNow that I know how close Donuts Plus is to USCIS, it will be a regular stop before or after immigration proceedings.",

    "text": "This was my standard 2 slice lunch at a new place for me, Palermo's on Rt. 206 South in Bordentown, NJ. \n\nThe joint has been at this location for a few decades it seems, and it shows its wear and tear both inside and out.  The booth I sat in was in need of new padding to compensate for the sag in the bench.  \n\nOn the other hand, service was attractive, lively and prompt. Ingrid was an excellent salesperson for the menu and seemed passionate about the Tomato Pie.  I ordered two slices well done, and Iced Tea.  When the slices arrived on their aluminum tray they were darkly brooding and steaming.  The chunky crushed tomato sauce was mildly sweet, while the cheese carried the slight overtone of salt.  The crust was thin, but not as micro as other shops, yet was definitely bending under the weight of the topside when lifted from the outer crust.  It didn't collapse and fold, but I did have to lift the point from its downward trajectory to get it into my mouth.  On the other hand, these were big slices. \n\nThis is a very good Tomato Pie, and I was glad Ingrid double checked with me between the TP and the Pizza.  She encouraged me to get a fresh small pie for optimal results, but I knew I wouldn't eat that much at lunch today.  Management has put a lot of effort into the right ingredients, and for the most part they have succeeded with a superior Trenton style Pie.  \n\nEveryone is a pizza expert, and I am, too.  While I will try the fresh out of the oven pie before a final judgment, my preliminary observations were positive, with the exception of thinking there might actually be too much cheese on these babies causing the weight and serious bending going on at lift off. \n\nStill with really superior taste and a strong biting crunch, Palermo's is worth another look or three.\n\nSEPTEMBER 9, 2015 - UPDATE: Returned today and sampled an Italian Sweet Sausage Sandwich with Saut\u00e9ed Onions, Peppers and Potatoes.  The sausage was butterflied and grilled thoroughly, and then placed at the bottom of a decent soft Italian long roll and overloaded with olive oil grilled peppers, onions and crispy cubed potato.  Very enjoyable.",

Working through the menu I have discovered my favorites and tend to repeat them on most visits.\n\nThe Xiao Long Bao (Shanghai Steamed Pork Soup Dumplings or Juicy Buns) are the Best of Breed to my taste in Philly.  Six steaming top knot dumplings that require skill and care to eat without squirting the soup onto your date.  The waitresses love to offer a lesson in proper technique.  Be sure to pour some of the vinegar with ginger into the dumpling after it is opened to enhance the flavor of the soup and pork ball inside. \n\nThe Shanghai Pan Fried Pork Dumplings are also very good for those who prefer that preparation.  While not quite the experience of  XLB, they are quite good with a vinegar chili sauce mix accompaniment.  \n\nAll the Vegetable and Tofu dishes are also good; the spicier the better. The Americanized dishes are okay, but clearly not as inspired, nor hot, as the more traditional Chinese styles.  When I go with my young son who is not acclimated to serious HEAT, he prefers the General Tso's Chicken, Orange Chicken, and Dan Dan Noodles.  They are all pleasing to him, but I find them a bit too sweet and thickly sauced, although the Dan Dan's are not bad at all when more Chili is mixed in. \n\nThe staff is very courteous and helpful.  No problem with attentiveness which can be an issue in some places.  \n\nCan't speak to the Japanese side of the menu, other than the take out menu is much prettier than the Chinese side.  Wonder what that means???",

The curry sauces are creamy and well spiced, with fresh chicken and veggies.  It is the place my then young son first tasted and began to appreciate Indian food.  He loved the Mango Lassis and Naans, and slowly tasted his way into a broader enjoyment of all the flavors, textures, and colors created in the kitchen.\n\nSometimes it is a bit hectic during the dinner rush, and the service while always friendly, can be spotty bordering on uncomfortable, but never having had a bad meal here over the many years of visiting, it has become a favorite while in town.  \n\nMany other gem show vendors come here after closing shop for the day.  On one occasion I sat next to a diamond merchant and his wife from India.  We started a conversation about business, and we ended up showing each other some of the stones we had with us right there on the tables, and finished a transaction the next day that resulted in some very happy gem folk buying/selling/trading stones that may never have transpired but for a common love of Indian food. Now, these good people are friends, and we plan to catch a meal together when in town.  \n\n Glad the resto didn't ask for a commission or finder's fee! \n\nIndia Oven gives a whole new meaning to the concept of, \"hidden gem.\"",

In those days, we could sit in the car as it went through the line of sprays, spinning brushes, waxing and drying.  It was like being eaten by a dragon, going through the entire digestive tract, and exiting the other end.  For a kid that was about as much fun as I could have without going on a family vacation. \n\nCar washes have evolved over time, and the drive through variety has been mostly replaced with the \"brushless\" system that removes the passengers from the car, and pulls the vehicle through the wash on a conveyor chain. We are left to watch from the windows of the hall alongside the washing system.  \n\nI still enjoy watching the process, and can't help imagining being inside the car. \n\nThe Broad Street Car Wash has been around for a long while, although I never used it before.  It is the same mechanism as in my hometown, but this one seems better run, is definitely cheaper, and comes across with a better finished product.  At under $12 for the \"Silver\" Inside and Out service, it is a great deal.  There is even a $2 Off coupon for the Diamond Service, which provides foot massage while you wait (NOT - but wouldn't that be great!).\n\nThat it is less than 10 minutes from my office, making it a lunch date.",

It is one of those places I never noticed until I asked around for a place that could repair the lining of my winter coat that had separated at its seam and needed to be reattached.  I was told that \"Lucy\" was very talented and could take care of it.  \n\nWalking in for the first time, the place is a bit dark and dreary; needing better lighting and a fresh coat of paint to really make it appear more appealing.  There is a small changing area in the front of the shop, and a large mirror where the recommended alternations are pinned.  \n\nLucy greeted me with a warm smile and listened and observed as I opened the old coat to show her the problem.  She took a close look and realized that the wool and silk had separated and could be replaced or repaired.  She gave me the cost differential, and I went for the repair @ $25.  Two weeks later I picked up the finished job, and have been happily wearing the coat since.  After that, I have returned to T & C every time I need tailoring or repair.  I have always been happy with the work.  \n\nWhile the work is first in class, the shop environment needs the same TLC that Lucy puts into the clothes she touches.  Some lights, brighter colors, living plants, a nice area rug, would go a long way to making T & C an even better place to get this excellent work done.",

    "text": "What a difference new ownership makes!\n\nLast time I was in this shop it was a different pizzeria that touted its alleged New York City ties. In fact, the pizza had no resemblance to something from the Big Apple.  One visit was more than enough.  That place is now history. \n\nWhat replaced it is another animal all together!  Jersey's Tomato Pies (and Bistro) actually knows what it is doing.  It turns out a very reasonable facsimile of authentic Trenton Tomato Pie, complete with super thin crust, quality Mozza base and chunky/sweet Tomato Sauce.  It was quite good, and my newly arrived foreign guests were treated to their first pizza that required no apologies.  They were very impressed and devoured our Sweet Italian Sausage Pie without much comment beyond satisfying grunts and big amazement eyes.  \n\nThank you, JTP&B for a cultural experience my Chinese guests will remember for a lifetime.  \n\nNow, to reach the 5 star apex achievement, only a little tweeking is needed.  The center of the pie was a little damp, making the lifting of a slice problematic as the cheese/tomato/sausage mix could not be picked up by the crust, but needed to be slid onto our plates and folded back onto the drier part of each wedge.  Removing more of the water from the tomato and slightly longer time in the oven to harden the doughy center, might solve this.  \n\nSmall nit is true, but when you come so close to perfection why not work to move the needle as far as it can go?",

    "text": "If you want an evening of All American Fun in the Central Jersey, Bucks County, Pa. area you can't do much better than catching a Trenton Thunder Minor League Baseball game at the newly renamed, Arm & Hammer Park on the riverfront in the state capital.  Although it is now 20 years old, the park still packs in the fans with a ton of concessions, decent and fairly priced food (I caught a $2 beer night), and a party festive atmosphere. Where it can easily cost a family of four a couple of hundred bucks to attend a Yankee or Phillie game to the north or south, here you can easily get away with less than a couple of Franklins. \n\nLast Thursday night my son, his buddy, and I attended the park but faced a prolonged rain delay of over two hours.  We were in and out of our seats and into the shelter of the main concession area a few times.  No one complained as they were having too much fun, and the ball club was absolutely raking in the dough as people loaded up on food and drink while we waited.  \n\nI definitely had the impression that management loved these rain delays for the increased profits from the captured audience.  Pretty smart move.   They did not want to spoil the party by declaring a Rain Out too soon. They let us stay so we could all sate ourselves and continue to hope the game would get underway.  It never did as the mid-June storm soaked the outfield and puddled up on the infield tarp. \n\nNo harm done.  The ticket stubs will be honored at a future game.",

But, why was the place empty but for me?\n\nHonestly, I don't know after eating some very good Southeast Asian cuisine tonight.  Vegetable Soup (Chicken Broth, but Veggie broth available) was piping hot and very tasty with lots of snow pea pods, broccoli and carrots.  Spicy Lemongrass with Chicken (nicely presented wok-fried dish with a really good tangy hot sauce and plenty of tender pieces of thin cut white meat), and Jasmine White Rice (softer than regular white rice); Ginseng Tea for a healthy chaser.  \n\nI know they were closed for lunch for a while, but I was advised lunch resumes this week.  Still closed on Tuesdays. \n\nBottom Line - I was totally satisfied, and will return. The cost of the meal as described, $20.  Maybe, the tea ($4) should be gratis in a nice place like this.  That would bring the cost down to a very reasonable dinner expense.\n\nI don't want to forget to mention the service was friendly, knowledgeable and timely. Thanks, Jackie.",

    "text": "Brothers Pizza has been a cornerstone in Langhorne for years, and the new shop in the converted Shell/Texaco station at the corner of Pine and Maple makes it into an institution.  \n\nThe restaurant is well designed with ample booths with high backs providing much more privacy than the old place.  There is a nice dining room that is separated by wood and glass doors from the take out/cashier area.  There is a level of comfort now that was missing in the earlier iteration.  \n\nThe pizza and tomato pie are good, but not exceptional.  The crust is firm and crunchy and holds the weight of the toppings securely. The sauce and cheese are above average, but are not homemade with chunky tomatoes, nor likely shredded in house.  The Eggplant Parm Grinder is one of the best in the area, with fresh Italian loaf, nicely pan fried Eggplant and the same pizza sauce and cheese as on the pizza.  The sandwich is returned to the oven before serving, toasting the top edge of the meal, melting the cheese, and exciting the entire mix to a higher level that tastes great with wonderful texture when eaten.  I really like it.  \n\nService is attentive.  I recognize one waitress as being with Brothers for many years.  She and her compatriots do a good job.  The prices are reasonable, and cheaper than the same meal down the hill in Newtown.  \n\nThe joint is busy at lunch and dinner. The new space is barely adequate for the crowd.

Whether cupcakes, breads, donuts or other pastries, I am game to give them a try. \n\nThe Happy Mixer in the Summit Square Shopping Center pays a steep rent to bake and sell their sweet delights. Hope they can appeal to enough people to make them successful, although a shop as limited as they are in this area is going to be challenged. Still, I stopped in to sample a few donuts and mini cakes to see what the hubbub was all about. \n\nI took a few bites of their apple cider donut with maple glaze frosting, the coconut crunchy donut, and the mini lemon pound cake.  My impression was that they did a very good job on the cake part of each of them, but that the icing was still a work in progress. The base of each had a good moist texture that tasted as fresh as today.  Liked it a lot.\n\n The glazing on each was stronger in flavor than expected, so much so that I found it was distracting from the overall enjoyment of each piece. It was thick, and easily flaked away from the underlying cake. The maple and lemon in particular felt like they were not really part of the donut or loaf, and the intensity of the flavors felt somewhat contrived to dominate the creation, rather than integrate with it. The lemon was very unusual and did not taste natural. Perhaps, too much extract was used. In any event, two bites were enough of that. Hopefully, a more mellow version will become available. \n\nThe shop is small and cute, with young assistants to take your order and ring it up. $13 and change for six pieces.  Everyone wants local business to succeed, and hopefully The Happy Mixer will find its niche in the community, with high quality baked goods that are far superior to the well known chains.",

This normally includes a brief full body massage while your feet soak in very hot herbed water to soften them up, while reclining comfortably in a large adjustable easy chair.  It has taken me several years to be able to put my sensitive feet into the near-scalding soup, but I finally can do it and actually enjoy it.  \n\nThe first squeeze of my trapezius let me know my masseuse meant business.  Ouch! She knew the pressure points, meridians, and even a few pleasure points along the way.  Her English was just good enough to say, \"relax.\"  Easy for her to say...\n\nThe foot portion of the hour was equally intense.  She triggered the deep sole points as she attempted to explain her concept of reflexology.  She would show me a place on my foot, and then say the body part of correspondence.  All the while her skilled and amazing strong hands prodded and dug, releasing the pain and tension I live with most days \n\nIt was an excellent massage. \n\nAt $50 for the hour, the price was decent, but no where near the $25 paid in New York's Chinatown or Flushing for the same work.  Still, there is a lot to be said for saving time, tolls and gas, so the cost was probably a savings, even with the expected $20 per first hour tip.",

The blueberry lemon sounded good. I took a seat at a small table up front to enjoy the streetview on a perfect autumn day. \n\nThe icing was a sugary blonde bouffant hairdo. It wasn't overly sweet, which allowed it's creaminess to shine through. The cake bottom was moist and firm like a solid white cake. I liked it, but a little bigger biteage would have pleased me more.

Both were happy to pose for photos when I pulled out my Yelp screen after ordering.  You can see the results.  \n\nThe lunch was very good.  Fresh, quality ingredients and TLC.  Plenty of stuffing for a large wrap.

    "text": "Every once and a while you enter a world so unusual that the experience is just as much anthropological as a chance to eat unexpectedly connected cuisines. This happened last night when we ventured into Asian Mix Restaurant just off Haldeman Avenue in far Northeast Philadelphia. This little piece of urban heaven has a fair share of Chinese, Korean, Russian Georgian and Uzbek kitchens, but this was my first time sitting down for a dinner of Korean/Uzbek/Ukrainian dishes springing naturally from the life of one family. \n\nImagine leaving Korea as a child with parents and siblings for a new home in Tashkent, Uzbekistan, on the western fringe of Asia along the ancient Silk Road. Assimilating what you could in that crossroads city, and then moving further east to Kiev, Ukraine, and ultimately a generation after first departure, arriving in the City of Brotherly Love. More adaptation. More Integration. \n\nYour grown children don't speak Korean, but are fluent in Uzbek, Russian and English. They open a restaurant offering what they learned to cook along the way; a menu equal shares spicy kimchee, soups, salads stuffed pastas and exotically prepared meats, chicken and fish. From these offerings, we selected potato Pierogi, kimchee, Ukrainian borscht and schnitzel made from ground chicken, turkey and beef (\"A Family Feast\") with a tomato/cabbage side salad with excellent balsamic vinaigrette. \n\nIt was all a little strange, but also very good. The pierogi looked like Chinese dumplings, with thin skin and a bit too watery mashed potatoes filling. Still very enjoyable. A dollop of sour cream implied eastern European sensibilities. Similarly, the borscht was a rich deep red served hot with mushrooms, beans and chunks of meat for flavoring. Very different than my grandmother's interpretation from Galacia that served this cold with a simple hot boiled potato and sour cream. Liked it alot. The kimchee was excellent and very spicy, the way it is done in the northern peninsula. The schnitzel had a nice walnut cream sauce, but was really more sliced meatloaf lightly fried, than a breaded fillet. Very good, but perhaps misnamed. The accompanying salad was a strong contributor to the plate. \n\nAs we ate, we saw that part of the owner's family was sitting in back with young children. They looked to be Korean, but as I walked by they were speaking Russian and English. I had the urge to sit with them and ask about their lives and long immigration story. \n\nI knew it was the stuff of family legend.",

Finding myself in the northern wilds of Bucks County on a visit to Ockanickon Boy Scout Reservation on an unforgiving day under the broiling sun, I  wove my way down twisting two lanes into the oasis town of Plumsteadville. The blacktop mirage rippled its shimmer view, making the buildings appear to float.  \n\nI spied the Plumsteadville Inn, and right next to it, Chubby's.  Normally, I don't like ice cream before 5, and prefer not to eat it alone. But, this was an exception.  I needed to lower my body temp before I started to act on my hallucinations.  I walked in, and the AC hit me hard.  Two angels came to my aid, offering to provide me with cool scoops of any flavor I could imagine.  Because it was my first time in heaven they handled me a Golden Ruler as a gift (see photo).  They said it would help me stay \"measured.\" \n\nIt was up to me to design the proper elixir to counteract the heat.  Intuition led me to Salted Caramel and Black Cherry. It was lovingly served me in a styro cup, for under $5.  The angelic smiles as I tossed the change into their prayer jar will not be forgotten.  \n\nBy the time I walked the short distance to my car the ice cream was already melting.  I tasted both before I would be required to drink from the cup.  Sheer excellence.  Cool, creamy, sweet, salty, chunky, chewy - Ambrosia of the Gods.  What else do angels serve on a sweltering day?\n\nArcAngel Chubby does not make his own ice cream.  It is Nelson's Ice Cream, made in Royersford, Pa.  It may not be the bestest ice cream I have ever tasted, but on a day like today when shoes stick to pavement, it came straight from Valhalla.",

The space is clean and attractive, with a well hidden drive thru component around to the back.  \n\nI went in the other evening for a light dinner and to help nourish my life long Southern Fried Chicken addiction. I just can't seem to get enough.  Love the crunch and the hot oil burning my fingers. Love the spicy coat.  Love the way it pulls away from the bone with a little coaxing. \n\nThese days, fried chicken is offered on the more sophisticated menus, and even for breakfast with waffles for those who just want max carb load.  (I'm not there yet.)  But, just because someone with a chef's hat and culinary school degree puts a batch together doesn't mean it is any better than the cheaper, faster, mass produced variety.  In fact, there is a school of thought that fried chicken is like singing the blues.  You know; \"You have to suffer if you want to sing the blues...\" Those hands playing six string acoustic or even Lucille, bring something to the experience that can be felt deep in the soul.  \n\nChicken be that way, too.  The true fried chicken artists, like the best Delta or Hills Blues guitarists and singers, are rooted in a culture and existential angst that generates the creative instinct leading to emotionally charged performances.  Those same forces are at work with fried chicken.  In the hands of a master, the chicken becomes an extension of his life, the same way a great song emerges from that primordial place deep in the heart.\n\nThis 2 piece box o' chicken may not have been epic, but it was solid and even inspired this review.  So, even though we weren't sitting in Muscle Shoals, Alabama in a roadside chicken house, there was enough there to let the imagination run wild.\n\nJust wish they actually played that music at Popeye's, rather than the current soundtrack.",

Yes. They say the letters stand for \"Heart of Bordentown,\" but there is another deeper meaning.  Bordentown has a rich if mysterious history of being the place where Napoleon Bonaparte was spirited away from Elba by French royalists who wanted to protect him from the republican elements at work in France, and hide him until the time was right for the 3rd Empire.  What better place than a tiny hamlet in the New World where his family owned a vacation home on a rise overlooking a wild Delaware River? Who would notice a small man speaking French walking around the village?  \n\nToo, it is easy to imagine entering Middle Earth and sitting in a Hobbit home while here. It is dark and glowing with friendly inhabitants that are inviting and have an open kitchen for all who visit.  So, if you give yourself time to consider the possibilities, and settle in, you could have quite an adventure. \n\nThe HOB is a dive in the best sense of the word.

The menu options for sandwiches, burgers, salads, etc., remarkably diverse.

Warmly greeted, I perused the menu and ordered the Eggplant Parm Sandwich and a drink.  While waiting, I observed the daughter working on a book report, while her infant brother was being entertained by an older sibling.  Mom worked as the chief chef and cashier, while a couple of other guys helped out, all the while keeping up a lively conversation en Espanol.  \n\nThe food arrived with the mozza melted over the top of the eggplant and filing the valley made by the open torpedo roll.  First bite, very hot, but tender nightshade nicely contrasted by the well toasted and crunchy roll.

The overall consumption was a pleasure, with even the olive oil adding to the experience.  \n\nAJ Pizza could use some elbow grease in the corners to avoid being a dive, but the dining was fine.

For $7.95 it came with a small side salad and three of their garlic knots.  \n\nI should have further asked for penne, because what arrived on a large square plate was spaghetti with plenty of sauteed spinach and thin sliced garlic. Not a biggie, but I laughed at myself for missing that detail. Laughed again when I had to ask for a soup spoon in order to be able to spin it onto the fork for neat consumption. Details. \n\nWhen I finally got down to it, the taste was very good and enjoyable. The biggest surprise on the upside was  the garlic knots that were hand delivered wrapped in aluminum foil a few minutes later. They were amazingly excellent! Great texture, perfectly baked and brought to life by the oven flame. Spiced and crunchy with strong garlicy flavor, and designed to sponge all the aglio olio swimming in the bottom of the platter. Best of breed. \n\nAJ's doesn't look like much, and could use some TLC, but if you can look beyond that, you can find some decent grub and even some awesome details.",

    "text": "Manny Brown's is in the Summit Square Shopping Center, down the strip from Giant Supermarket, and close by Moishe & Itzy's Deli.  \n\nHow much more interesting both places would be if they knocked down the wall and served each other's customers.  Pastrami and beer, and 13 TVs would be a boon to both.  Maybe, this will start them talking.  I know they are not directly next to each other, but why should that stop the integration of interests?\n\nManny's is a friendly place with a game plan of serving a good mix of draft crafty beer, and a decent bar menu.  It does not have the room to offer the alternatives of Isaac Newton's, nor the diveyness of The Clubhouse to be a buffalo wing sports bar, but falls somewhere between the two.  Neither is the clientele the same as those mentioned.  It is not as yuppified as Isaac's, nor as dank and noisy as Clubhouse.  It servers those who are somewhere in the middle on the day they choose to go there.  It provides a reasonable alcohol component, satisfying grub and sports with the sound turned down.  A good compromise on the right occasion. \n\nI was there on a Saturday afternoon during the World Cup.  The bar was mostly empty except for a few couples as tables awaiting lunch.  I was looking for a quick bite as I selected which TV monitor to watch.  I went with their Burger and Fries - a juicy half pounder with Saut\u00e9ed Onions, Melted Swiss, and a large pile of Fries, and the Columbia v. Greece match.  I relaxed with a Domestic Draft awaiting service of my lunch, and chatted with the bartender trainee and her manager.  They were friendly, and clearly into their jobs.  \n\nThe Burger was quite satisfying and would qualify as comfort food on those nights when necessary.  The price at under $10. for the meal was an excellent deal.  \n\nI wondered why I did not go there more often, and resolved to remedy that oversight in the near future.",

    "text": "Great to spend the morning in Fishtown having breakfast at the Milkcrate Cafe at the corner of E. Columbia and Girard. Interesting enviro with a huge record collection spanning music of the late 20th/early 21st Centuries. I didn't make it down to the vinyl shop in the basement (just read about it in their Yelp page), but as a holder of old wax, I wish I had. Next time. \n\nStill, the cafe is part of the gentrification of this part of Philly and is in the perfect location to take advantage of it. It is a bit dusty around the edges, but with La Colombe coffee holding court and a good kitchen, it offers a mellow sitdown and strong java flow, with comfort food designed for the pioneering spirit of the surrounding neighborhood. Easy to spend hours there sipping joe and doing light sledding on your screen. \n\nLoved the caffeine and found the well stuffed \"Flying Breakfast Burrito Brother\" a large tasty bite and chew. It was hot and moist and almost more than I could eat; but I managed to slay that dragon, and spend a few extra minutes watching the street life on Girard Avenue on a cold sunny morn. \n\nIt would be great to have a home on one of the narrow streets of this old revivalist corner of P.delph, but until that day arrives, Milkcrate will just have to be that place I can feel at home.",

The menu has all the usual suspects, especially breakfast, with a full list of egg/omelet, pancake/french toast possibilities and decent coffee served in red mugs. \n\nI went with their Italian Omelet, but subbed feta cheese for their regular provolone.  No sweat.  It was served less than ten minutes later and was quite good, with crispy home fries and rye toast.  There were plenty of sweet sausage, onion and pepper in addition to the fresh feta.

Yeah, it doesn't exactly look like a stainless roadside palace; designed to appear more like a massive adobe warehouse on the outside and something out of the fantasiful Arabian Nights, within. While not a regular visitor, sometimes it is exactly what I am looking for, especially when the answer to every existential question is, \"cheesecake!\"\n\nIt certainly filled that bill last night. We weren't sure what we wanted for dinner, but knew what we didn't. Tired of checking off all the ethnic styles available within driving distance and eliminating most of them, we came to Cheesecake Factory. It had dishes from all continents, a bar, and those awesome creamy sweet cool desserts. Perfect cure for indecisiveness. We drove to Willow Grove in about 30. The expansive hall was busy but not full. We were seated immediately near the bar.\n\nWe caught the final minutes of happy hour and celebrated with half price glasses of an excellent cabernet. We selected the Crispy Brussel Sprouts for an appetizer (wonderfully done with bacon and maple syrup), and their Southwest Chicken Sandwich (strong contender in a crunchy baguette and spicy aioli), and Shepherd's Pie (savory ground beef and veggies in mushroom gravy topped with a load of mashed potatoes and melted cheese). Toasting our way through the meal, we completed with a flourish of a thick slice of shared almond cheesecake (they bake them right). \n\nThis was a full and fun dinner that permitted us to chose cravings that we didn't know we had. We couldn't finish any of it, and brought enough home for another meal. Cheesecake Factory may not see us again for a while, but it's good to know it's there when we need the modern American diner to help us decide what to eat.",

    "text": "El Changarro ( \"small shop\") in Mexican Spanish slang,  is exactly that - a small grocery/variety store with a Mexican Guatamaltecan kitchen and dining room in the rear. Like most of the other Latina cocinas in and around Bucks County, it caters to the growing population from south of that border so much in the news lately. (Have to say from observation that there are many more good cooks and entrepreneurs entering the USA, than undesirables. I guess the wall is to limit the number of Mexican restaurants setting up businesses around the country.) Please excuse the editorial. \n\nSo, I was there for a weekend dinner recently having learned about the joint on Yelp. As directed, I walked through the store to the dining area in back. It was pretty big. About a dozen tables nicely spaced,  colorful mural on the walls and wood carved people with amusing faces and traditional costume all around. The gestalt back there was definitely a little reality altering. It almost became a Mexican town square. \n\nFood was ordered at the kitchen window and delivered to the table. My order was taken by a bilingual young guy. It was prepared by three women who were not. The menu had most of the usual suspects and house made bebidas and liquidas frescas. I went with an al pastor quesadilla rather than three tacos, to increase the contents and reduce the amount of tortilla. It was served about 10 minutes later. It was plump from all the spicy roast pork, beans, lettuce, tomato, pineapple and queso. It required knife and fork to avoid spillage. \n\nLiked it a lot. Plenty of flavor and texture. Moist, too. I spread red salsa on top to ensure adequate burn. Filled me completely and left a pleasant belch at the finish. Ahh. \n\nRight down Street Road from Parx Casino, in a shopping center with plenty of parking. Worth a trip.",

This is an adaptive reuse that still works in the 21st. \n\nMy french toast was a well made two slice platter which was enough for me, decent sausage patties and a bottomless cup of java.

    "text": "Generally speaking, the Chinese restaurants in the far Northeast Philadelphia have been disappointing. Most seem to have settled into a \"good enough\" attitude when it comes to their kitchens, with little effort for excellence, nor originality. It is regrettable that the locals have few decent choices until they are prepared to travel farther down Bustleton, or all the way to Chinatown for a good meal.  \n\nOne of the few exceptions to such poor performances is Taste Queen on Krewstown Road, just off Grant Avenue.  We settled in there for dinner late last week, and found it to be refreshingly concerned about quality cooking and satisfied knowledgeable customers. While it is accurate to called the \"Queen\" a study in pink as others mention, that eye-irritant is soon forgotten when dinner is brought to the table.  We were able to request a higher heat quotient than normal from our Hunan Chicken and Orange Beef, and actually have it prepared as we wished.  Both were large platters, with extra spicy black bean sauce on the chicken, and real Szechuan peppers mixed in with the tender beef.  They were so satisfying that we did not need to ask for more sesame oil or chili sauce. Very good job!\n\nWhat was even more surprising was their rendition of Pumpkin Soup, on their Specials Board.  It was rich, creamy and very fresh.  Someone in the kitchen knows a thing or two about non-Chinese cuisine. \n\nService was friendly and prompt, and the server didn't mind me practicing my baby Chinese.  She was quite amused. \n\nFinally an above average Chinois joint within range of home that meets our expectations for good Middle Kingdom dishes.  \n\nReturn guaranteed.",

    "text": "This may now be La Parrilla Steakhouse, but for me it will always also be DeLorenzo's on Hamilton Avenue, Trenton, NJ.  I was there too many times eating excellent pizza to be able to forget what came before. \n\nHo Hum.\n\nBut, that is not to say that this new Guatemaltecan meat house is not a very worthy successor.  It certainly is.  Where most Latino restaurants in and around the capital city are geared to feeding the neighborhood in a very down-country homey and comfortable dive (in a good way), La Parrilla has higher aspirations.  It is a degree or two fancier than most other casas, and the focus is primarily on meat in all forms, as opposed to handling the desires of the larger populous.  It offers 3 squares a day, like many others do, but does it in a somewhat more upscale environment.  The HDTVs and air conditioning were all working well, so there was no need to feel like I was living in Central America in order to enjoy their cuisine (although, I admit to liking that authenticity by necessity, too).\n\nAlthough I really enjoy Central American kitchens, something on their menu caught my eye - the Guayo Burger.  I decided to check out this crossover dish to see how they would interpret this North American standard.  In addition to the expected Chips & Salsa (good), the large plate arrived with a 1/3 pound burger, done to my requested medium, with Lettuce, Onion, Spicy Mayo and broken Potato Chips inside.  Along side was a massive pile of French Fries, nice and crisp.  The roll had sesame seeds and reminded of a Whopper.  The real stand out was the mixture of taste and texture with each chomp.  It was very good, but not so foreign as to lose sight of its origination.  If they had stuffed some of the fries inside the sandwich, it would have been a dead ringer for an Animalized In N Out Burger.  A few grilled Jalapenos would have been totally over the top.  Still, it was very satisfying just as it was.  \n\nThe homemade Horchata was excellently made; the rice and cinnamon blended drink, cold and so refreshing.  The whole meal came to under $12. \n\nDef want to come back to try some of their BBQ grilled meats.  \n\nPRO TIP - Street parking only, so try to come early or late as parking around there on Hamilton Avenue can be challenging.  Side streets offer more opportunities.",

    "text": "This was my first visit to Chili Szechuan since its relocation from Baltimore Avenue in West Philly.  It is certainly larger than before, and its booths and dark tones, more cozy than before. It has always offered authentic Szechuan spicy cuisine from Chongqing, China, but now it even adds the reality of many restaurants especially in the northern climes, of being chilly temperature-wise in winter.  We appreciated the cultural use of cold weather and wore our coats during the meal in honor of the reminiscent freeze in the house. Brrrr....\n\nThe food was as good as before. Spicy Lamb Chops, Szechuan Chili Sauce Fish Fillets, Eggplant in Garlic Sauce and Crispy Shrimp - Sweet & Sour, were our choices. They were all good to great, although our waiter admitted that even on the non-Americanized menu, they cut the heat for a western customer. So, even though we were mostly Chinese at the table, we all suffered through reduced burn and numbness. Next time, we will insist on the full monty fire treatment. We can all handle it!\n\nThe dishes arrived as prepared by the kitchen, and not all at once. Thus, the spicy lamb chops made the first impression of the night. They were excellent; with enough cumin and pepper to heat the tongue and gums, but not anesthetize them. Fun finger food.  Next came the eggplant in garlic sauce.  It, too, was a strong contender, with plenty of Chinese nightshade and a thick, rich dark amber coat. It could have been hotter, as the innate sweetness of the veggie dominated the other flavors, and needed more competition from Szechuan chilies. The shrimp was delivered next.  It was good, with 10 jumbos in an orange glaze. However, it was far more sweet than sour, and suffered most from Americanization syndrome. It really needed a blast from the smelter to bring out its hidden attributes. Finally, the Szechuan chili sauce fish fillets arrived in a deep dish to accommodate the soupy red hot bath it cooked in.  This dish was excellent and packed the most punch.  Tender pieces of boneless flounder is a beautiful orange/red conglomerated hot liquid.  Finally, a little numbness!\n\nWe passed on their dessert options, as they were not Chinese, and all came from an outside vendor.  The hot tea was from a non-descript bag, rather than loose pack.  Not so good. \n\nOverall, Chili Szechuan was a worthwhile trip on a cold winter night, yet it would do itself a favor by fixing the heating equipment, not making assumptions about \"round eyes,\" and upgrading their tea choices. While these are mostly secondary considerations, they do detract from the experience.  As such, it really can't compare holistically to Han Dynasty or the other Hot Houses in Philly, where those details mean something.",

All dishes were substantial and we had plenty more than the two of us could handle, and a large amount to take home. On top of that, before leaving we picked up a pound of sliced roast pork because it looked so good hanging in the window. It was delicious and we worked through it for the next week. It was lean with thin layer of fat under the crispy brown dermis. \n\nLau Kee reminded of Ting Wong, a worthy place for a solid meal across the traditional food groups of Cantonese cuisine, with a comfort level that was inviting to regular visits for families or octogenarians on a date.

    "text": "The Five Four Bar & Grill takes its moniker from the local zip code for this part of Levittown, Pa.  It is a fairly new house with large rooms for the bar, dining and even two pool tables for those so inclined.  Friday and Saturday nights starting around 9:30 local bands rock the casbah. The crowd is a mix of ages and interests, but have found a neighborhood spot where everyone is welcome, the drinks are not expensive, and the kitchen turns out reasonable good bar food and a few higher end dinner specials.  It is a non-smoking establishment. \n\nWe sat in a booth near the green felt tables, a little distance from the bar, but close by the stage.  We didn't mind when the pool cues invaded our space. We just moved the beer bottles and pint glasses to the other side.  Sharing is caring.  The Labatt Blue Draft was cold and refreshing, and the Coney Island Orange Vanilla Cider tasted like Brooklyn summer on the beach.  The prices from the multi-paged beer list were surprisingly low, especially after patronizing some other bars up county.  \n\nDinner consisted of a Burger, Chicken Tender Wrap and Chicken Parm Sandwich.  All came with crisped French Fries.  They were all good, if not outstanding.  The Plain Burger with Cheese, Lettuce, Onion and Tomato was on a decent fresh roll, and came out slightly beyond the Medium requested.  Still good, but not memorable.  The Wrap disappeared quietly without complaint, and my Parmesan was also tasty on another good roll and enough red gravy.  None of these dishes were large, but given the price range, were more than enough for a light bite. Service was very friendly and prompt.  We were satisfied, but did not understand why silverware was not provided for the meals without request.  No biggie, but seemed odd.   \n\nUnfortunately, we had to depart before the band came on, but Five Four is worth a return visit later on a weekend evening to catch the show.",

Outside was a large trailered-up grill/smoker ready to be hitched and taken on the road.  Step inside, and the knotty pine paneling and wood plank tables with red checkered cloths put you in a mind of a backcountry store where BBQ and moonshine are a way of life up there in the Smokey Mountains outside Ashville or Gatlinburg.\n\nThe menu is small reflecting the size of the joint.  In for lunch, the friendly server showed me the specials menu, and I opted for the Pulled Pork Sandwich with Cheddar and Saut\u00e9ed Onions on a fresh oversized smooth topped Roll.  It came with chips, but for a buck extra, fries could be subbed in.  While I waited I sipped on my Lemonade and listened to the banter between the employees.  This might be Bensalem, but the accents and topics of conversation were straight from the southern Appalachians. I was right there with 'em. \n\nThe sandwich arrive full-plate, and I opened it up to have a look-see, and taste a small sample.  First impression was of a fully smoked meaty lean pork; good texture, but perhaps cooked with a milder marinade and BBQ sauce that left the meat juicy, yet not as flavorful as I like.  The Dudes were ready for that as the table had 3 bottle rockets of sauce ready for squirting.  Spicy, Hickory and Apple were the flavors.  I tasted each and found the Apple to be the most intriguing and tasty.  It had a nice fruity sweetness that was distinct from the other undertones of vinegar, molasses and brown sugar.  A long squirt dousing the pile of pork quickly resolved that issue.  \n\nFrom that point on the entire experience was pleasurable and satisfying.  I liked the Apple BBQ Sauce so much I added some to the chips, and if I had ordered the fries, would have used it rather than ketchup.  These sauces are for sale at the counter.  \n\nWhile great BBQ is hard to come by in this neck of the woods, Smoke 'n Dudes provides something very close to what I love - fall off the bone, spicy, tangy well grilled and smoked meat that assault the salivary glands and squeeze them dry.  \nWhat I would have given for the right beer and shot of Dickel at that moment! Alas, this was lunchtime in Bensalem, and that fantasy would have to await another time or place.\n\n  BYOB for dinner???",

The earlier Viet cafe at that corner was not all that good, so it was with a pleasant sense of change that this new operation caught my attention. \n\nWe walked over after shopping and found our way up to the second floor dining room. It looked basically the same as before with modern simple decor and large windowed walls overlooking Washington Avenue. There was a family at the middle table, so we grabbed one against the inner wall where we all could maintain some privacy. The guy overseeing things came over with menus, took our drink order (water) and placed white curved plates and flatware wrapped in black cloth napkins at the head of the table. Classy for lunch. \n\nWe ordered beef skewers and mee katang, a fat noodle dish with veggies. Both arrived with color and energy glistening from them. The beef was a thin sliced, well marinaded BBQ, and grilled just enough to be tender, moist, lightly crisp and delicious. Really good. The flat noods had a wonderful sauce, subtly savory and sweet with plenty of greens mixed in. A little sriracha on the edge of the plate for dipping and we had an excellent dish. Loved it. \n\nWhile the menu was somewhat limited, we thoroughly enjoyed the food and bright atmosphere on an overcast day. Prices were reasonable ($24 w tip). Given it's convenience to the market next door, we could become regulars of this appetizing Cambodian house.",

    "text": "This old diner located at the intersection of Limekiln Pike and Mt. Carmel Avenue in Glenside, PA, is a miniature of today's full monte diner experience. The counter has only 6 spinners, and the main dining rooms together, less than a dozen tables. But, size does not tell the story of Moonlight Diner. This place has been running since the middle of the last century feeding this neighborhood with solid victuals and homemade desserts. That I was the only customer by the time I finished breakfast does not reflect on the quality of the experience.\n\nI sat on the last stool on the right overlooking the refrigerator full of juice and milk and the kitchen door. The friendly server approached with a menu and inquiry about drinks. Coffee with a small glass of milk arrived in front of me two minutes later. I order their Farmers Omelet (onion, tomato, mushroom, bacon, feta cheese extra with home fries folded in) and rye toast, and took a phone call as I waited. The platter was placed before me before the call ended. \n\nFirst bite alerted me to the need for a shake of black pepper and squirt of Frank's Hot Sauce, which I promptly applied. Those adjustments did the trick and it was smooth sailing from there. The taste and texture were excellent and it was a completely filling breakfast. Everything blended well together and seemed in perfect harmony. Coffee mug refills were forthcoming when required. Service was timely and cordial. They treated this stranger well. \n\nMuch appreciated.",

The bar was long and packed.  The dining tables seemed to turn over quickly enough without a reservation.  We waited about 20 minutes for a deuce hightop mid-floor.  The service dudes were all \"can do!\" \n\nMy burger was very good and required knife and fork as I could never open my jaws wide enough to capture it in a bite.  My companion's sliders were also tasty.  The French Onion Soup was decent, but not the strongest entry of the evening.  \n\nSteam (suggestive of the locomotive steam engine), appears to have a successful formula.  Space, fairly priced drinks($5 margaritas, beer specials), a long happy hour, and an above average bar menu.  Live music, too.  \n\nI will likely be back.",

    "text": "I've had a light addiction for tuna hoagies of late, and this Friday afternoon I found myself thinking about satisfying it again. Yelp alerted me to a Jersey Mike's down on Street Road in the Giant shopping center in Feasterville, about seven miles away. I found their app and ordered a standard sized sub with sesame seed roll, and added tomato, mayo, black pepper, lettuce, banana hot and sweet peppers. I drove down and arrived as the staff was finishing my order. It was right on time.\n\nBack at the office I opened the twisted end wrapper and beheld a beautiful sandwich, if shorter than expected. First bite disclosed that the roll was superlative with bakery freshness, great texture and ideal flavor. On the other hand, the tuna tasted \"thin,\" and lacking substance - not really all that good. The banana peppers and sweets were no where to be found. The actual eating experience was satisfactory despite these drawbacks, but could have been so much better had there been more quality control on the tuna salad and double checking the desired ingredients. \n\nOverall, Jersey Mike's is somewhere in the middle of the pack of chain sub shop tuna hoagies available locally. Generally, mom and pop delis do them better, but there is wider diversity in how the tuna is prepared and more inquiry is needed to be sure each recipe has what you want in your sandwich. \n\n3.5 STARS",

From the outside you might decide not to go in, but that would be a case of judging a good book by it's rummy cover. \n\nWithin is a small and attractive dining room with white clothed tables and large buffet along the wall. For lunch the buffet provides eight hot curry-oriented choices, a few sweet desserts, basmati rice, with naan coming from the kitchen oven, for $9.99. I tend to avoid buffets due to incentive to over indulge, but the only other dishes available on the menu seemed to be a personal portion of one of the entrees on the buffet table, @ $7.99, plus naan. So, the cost was the same whether I ate too much or just enough. Alas, the cost of principled consumption. \n\nNo matter, my buttered chicken was quite good in its mild yellow creamy sauce. The bird was a little dry, but I enjoyed it nonetheless. The naan arrived at the table hot, steaming and absorbtive. In the absence of rice it did excellent work as the spongy spoon lifting the extra curry to my mouth so as to leave nothing but crumbs behind. My lunch mate had nothing but praise for the buffet, and all the rice and naan desired. \n\nThere are better Indian kitchens, but none in the immediate vicinity. So, when the urge tugs this is not a bad option for scratching your itch. \n\n3.5 Big Ones!",

I sat on one of them as a sole diner, facing the work area. A server walked over with menu and inquiry about something to drink. At that time of morning, coffee was the only thing on my mind. It was strong and bracing. The breakfast choices were extensive, and I selected the Veggie Omelet & Home Fries with Rye Toast. \n\nIt was all quite good, with a load of fresh greens and melted cheddar. Including the half plate of potatoes and two slices of buttered bread, it was too much for me to consume, but a strong tasty breakfast all the way down.

    "text": "Sitting in the long shadow of Bowman's Tower, the Conservation Corps public works project in the 1930s putting people back to work during the Depression, the tavern on beautiful River Road approaching New Hope, PA, is a well executed colonial style pub. It has a dark paneled dining room, and revolutionary edged barroom that capture what it may have been like to be part of the independence effort in the 18th Century around here. It really feels good to be part of that, even if just for lunch. \n\nI was there for the first time in at least a decade, and the new ownership can be proud of what it has maintained, and created in terms of atmosphere and ethos. Their menu is wholesome with wide choice of apps, sandwiches, soup, salad, burgers, and trop cher entrees. When I spied a brussel sprouts side dish and potato bisque, I knew where I was going. Two of my favorite ingredients in any dish - cream based potato soup and kale/brussels side salad were too special to pass up. Even better, my lunchmate went with the scallops main course and slid a couple onto my plate for the tasting. Yes!\n\nEverything was very good to amazing. The bisque seemed to have mushroom puree mixed with the pomme de terre, making for a savory rendition. Delicious. The balance between the slightly bitter kale, and the more subtle brussel sprouts was a bit off to my taste. It needed more petit choux and less kale to really make me happy (in fact, the kale was not in the a la carte sides description, but was definitely in the dish). The seared scallops was true to their word, and just mildly grilled, with sweet potato puree, caramelized apples, pancetta, almonds and cider brown butter drizzle. It was a real treat, but a heavy lift for lunch @ $27. \n\nBowman's Tavern is deep with atmosphere, and successfully carries out its promise of colonial charm, local produce where possible, and skilled hands in the kitchen. It is easy to imagine the General and his officers discussing plans for the next battles around the bar, or at the dinner table in the back room.",

    "text": "Fill A Bagel & Bread is a locally owned/operated bagel shop on Pennsylvania Avenue, Oreland, PA. It is their second store, and they have been a success baking and selling their goods to the surrounding communities for decades now. I was in the area after an appointment and hungry enough for breakfast as I drove back to my Bucks County office. A cuppa hot java and an onion bagel smeared with veggie cream cheese punched my ticket. \n\nWhat about the bagel? \n\nWell, it wasn't the best I've had, but far from the worst. Although fresh, I found its texture too dense, like perhaps the dough was kneaded too long before boiling/baking. The circumference of the rolled and twisted dough was smaller than ideal, and lacking air pockets that help lighten the bite and chew and allow the veggie cream cheese to afford more balance with the slightly sourdough flavor. The taste was alright, but the texture was not what I prefer. Plenty of roasted onion flakes all around. Service, friendly and efficient.\n\nI agree with the comments that the cost/benefit is somewhat askew for the nature of the business, location and overall quality. I have paid less for better bagels and coffee in bigger towns and cities. Yet, I don't know their running costs, and no doubt the shop reflects its financial need to pay the bills and make a reasonable profit. \n\nSo, I find myself at the borderline between three and four stars attempt to find the right equipoise. I land at \n3.5 Stars, and allow the app to round it up to 4. \n\nI would certainly return given the opportunity.",

    "text": "Chinatown Caf\u00e9 is an refugee from Race Street, Philadelphia.  Owner Cary is a Bucks County pioneer, coming to this frontier lacking in quality Chinese cuisine, and opening his shop several years ago because he saw an opportunity to be one of the first quality chefs to start a business. He knew there was a great need, and the socio/economic means to support it.  \n\nHe has succeeded.  Chinatown Caf\u00e9 stand above most of the rest of the Chinese restos in Central Bucks, if not the entire domain.  The quality, taste, and overall gestalt of his shop are exceptional.  From soup through fortune cookie, the dining experience feels wholesome and well suited to the Chinese/American palate.  Cary knows what people like, and provides it at a high level.  When inside his world, you feel you will be exiting onto 11th Street.  \n\nThis week I went in for lunch.  Although there is a lunch special menu, after my recent experience with an awful lunch at another place, I did not want to go that way.  So, I ordered off the main menu - Duck Fried Rice.  I knew that Cary was a duck wizard.  Out came a huge steaming platter loaded with well seasoned rice and big pieces of roast duck.  It was enough for 6 people.  It was moist, flavorful, and exactly what I wanted.  Just Ducky! \n\nCary and I chatted a bit about our businesses, and when he realized I spent time in China, he brought out a bowl of Wonton Soup for me to sample.  Very nice of him to do so.  The broth was rich, golden and as good as my Jewish grandmother made. Swimming easily in the bowl were several fancy goldfish wontons, with nearly translucent skin, and silky tails.  Stirring the mix gave the impression that the wontons were alive and enjoying themselves peacefully in a koi pond.  I think this style wonton is actually called, \"Butterfly Wonton,\" but they look like goldfish to me. \n\nThe last remains of the Duck Fried Rice sits in my refrigerator awaiting consumption.  I have enjoyed it daily since the visit.  I have to finish it before I can go back for more. \n\nFour Stars with a Bullet.  I have to see what Chinatown Caf\u00e9 does not the spicy end of the spectrum to be completely in love.",

Mirim Japanese and Korean Restaurant was the most interesting choice in the area, so we drove over to their location in a small commercial strip that also housed fried chicken, pizza and Chinese massage parlors for future exploration. \n\nWe quickly discovered that lunch menu was not available on weekends, so we ordered two dishes at dinner prices.  We went with Dolsot Bulgogi and Pork Katsu, which came with the traditional Banshan small dishes that accompany most Korean meals.  They were all well spiced pickled veggies, cabbage and sprouts that went well alone and with the spicy boiling beef bulgogi and the nicely breaded and pan fried katsu.  Everything was done well, and service was adequate, if lacking personality. \n\nThe room was divided into three areas; front dining room with booths, rear dining room with tables and a sushi bar.  Mirim had been there for a long time, and the water stained ceiling and the floor had seen better days.  Still, the kitchen knew what it was doing, and we were satisfied with our meals.  We took home what we couldn't finish, and enjoyed it with dinner. \n\nI had visited Mirim many years ago and remember it as being in better shape than it was yesterday.  In the interim many more purely Korean houses have opened between there and Center City Philadelphia.  These newer places have the advantage of youth and the growing appreciation for Korean cuisine - especially their awesome fried chicken.  Mirim could get its groove back if it took a look at what was going on around them, made some needed upgrades in facility and menu choices, and considered being a purely Korean shop.",

As a local outfit headquartered in Wilmington, Delaware, it is good to see how attractive their plant is and how successful their business model has been. \n\nWe used Yelp to get on their wait-list on a Sunday evening, and when we arrived they had us on the screen and we were seated immediately at a high top quad against a wall. The building was beautifully appointed with lots of wood and leather, high ceiling, and huge glass wall in the back to show off the brewery operation. The space was well thought out for the comfort and interest of the customer. Our server was friendly and knowledgeable, and aimed to please.\n\nSon & I were thinking burgers and sandwiches, but I was also tempted by the seasonal Butternut Apple Soup on the appetizer menu. So, the young one went for a Grilled Chicken Sandwich w Fries, and the old man jumped at the Pub Burger w Fries (medium). First, the soup was really good with a cream base. The flavors of the squash and apple both came through. So nice! The burger was as requested - juicy, with gouda and jack cheese, bacon and aioli smear on the brioche style roll. Delicious, even if the bottom of the roll gave up the ghost halfway through the meal due to the dampness of the load. I had to finish with knife & fork. Son 'O Mine was happy with his meal, but didn't think it was exceptional. Fries were hot and crisp. \n\nI sampled their Little Red Wagon suds. Maybe it was a kid's drink, but I liked the subtle strawberry rhubarb sour taste. Good complement to the rest of my meal. \n\nIron Hill is a big improvement to the restaurant scene in Newtown, along with several other eateries in the Village @ Newtown. It contributes to establishing our community as a legitimate destination for the hungry and parched. So many quality choices now available to us. \n\nCheck it out.",

The bartenders are so busy they don't have a moment to follow the action, but they are friendly and don't lose their cool. \n\nPrices are reasonable for a bar that makes it bones primarily around sporting events. Most bar food (burgers, quesadillas, soups, salads, sandwiches) can be had for $10 or less. Beer selection is not focused on crafties, but there are a few in the house, while most of the usual suspects are on tap.  My pint of Miller Lite was $3 and change. \n\nThe house erupted each time the Eagles made a play, and went berserk when they pulled out the win of the Rams. There was a collective groan when Carson Wentz was injured. Of course, there were a couple of people in too deep with drink, who were obnoxious, but they were led outside by the firm arm of house security. \n\nMy chicken quesadilla was pretty good. Loaded with chicken and cheese, it was a solid app to get me through the game. It was exactly what I expected from the neighborhood sports bar.
