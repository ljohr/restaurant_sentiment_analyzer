I ordered some ribs and had to send them back because one half was warm and the other half was refrigerator cold. They came back and one side was really hot and the other side was still cold, third time it was edible. The manager came over the third time to apologize, never once offered to comp anything. I'm not the kind of guy to cause a fuss to get something comped, but to send something back three times to get it cooked properly and only get an insincere apology really pisses me off, enough for me to write this review.",

I ordered to go, by the time I reached the car the bag was full of oil spilling out of the container. There was easily 5-7 tablespoons of oil on the dish. Not what I was told and not what anyone would ever want to eat. Horrible.   Their slogan even has the word healthy in it. What a joke.",

    "text": "Went here based on the high ratings and raves from people.  The entire experience was underwhelming from start to finish.  Their website which is fairly useless if you want to figure out the menu before going, you have to pick your location choice out of 3 locations and then drill down to the bottom to see the weak descriptions of their menu offering, no explanations and no price, just this\n\n    Roast Beef\n    Roast Beef Combo\n    Roast Pork\n    Roast Pork Combo\n    Baked Ham\n    Baked Ham Combo\n    Roast Turkey\n    Roast Turkey Combo\n    Broccoli Rabe\n    Broccoli Rabe Combo\n\n\nNo explanation of whats in a combo (its just where they add cheese by the way)\n\nThe table placecard (instead of menu) had a more detailed description than the website.  \n\nWhen I walked in, its more bar than restaurant, no big deal, but there were tables.  Since I couldnt decide and the sandwiches werent too expensive at $6.85, I got the roast beef and roast port combos.\n\nI got my two sandwiches fast enough, but the roast beef was cold and the roast pork was hot.  Not sure how a cook (for lack of a better word) could serve 2 things at the same time with such a temperature differential, one was obviously sitting for awhile.  I asked the waitress to reheat the roast beef while I finished the roast pork, and supposedly it was reheated, since it was warmer, but it was still cold-ish compared to my roast pork I had just finished.  The waitress did offer to replace it when she inquired, but I was in a hurry and didnt really care for a hot version of this sandwich.\n\nThe sandwiches were very skimpy on meat, but they \"made up for it\" by adding too much gravy to make it overly messy and the bread was disintegrating.  The menu place card mentions the \"wet meat\" option where you get less gravy, I strongly recommend you get it that style, especially if the gravy overpower the meat and structural integrity of the sandwich.",

    "text": "Quality of this store has gone downhill over the past few years. In the past,  I was able to easily choose from a wide selection of food at reasonable prices any time of day. I have noticed recently that the produce is not as fresh, but more expensive,  and the prices of the organic foods are more expensive than Whole Foods. This morning I debated on going to Wegmans or going to this store. I only had to get a few items so I decided on this Giant since it was closer. Big mistake. I have seen on average at least 3 or 4 people shopping around 5 a.m. In the past but today just me. They had all of the store roped off where it was impossible to get to certain aisles and very difficult to get to the register. In my frustration I went under a rope to get soup.  I was then berated by a number of people who were supposed to be cleaning the floors but some were just standing around doing nothing. I couldn't even walk out of the closest door because that was blocked off. If they needed to clean the floor they should have closed the store for a few hours. It would have taken less time at Wegmans which is where I will shop for now on.",

Steak was fatty and overcooked and mashed potatoes werent fresh. The waitress was about the only thing good about this place. She agreed on the steak and took it back.

    "text": "Went to see Star Wars Rogue One yesterday in 3D.  Buying the tickets was a breeze, and the atmosphere was inviting.  Found the comfortable seats with no problem and ordered right away before the movie began.  I ordered pretzel sticks - food was hot, prompt & delicious.  I was excited for the movie to begin.  Once the advertisements were done and the movie started, that's when I noticed something wasn't right.  The entire screen was so dark that I was not able to make out the faces of the actors on the screen.  I kept lifting up the 3D glasses to see if it made a difference - nope.  The two people seated next to me were noticing the same and complaining.  I thought that maybe this is how the movie was filmed?  Then it got worse.  Even with the 3D glasses on, the shadows in the background on the screen were double and there was no discerning most actors' faces at all.  I got up and went to the lobby and asked for the manager.  The gentleman wore a blue shirt, middle age with a beard, said that this was the 3D experience, it was a \"closed-system\" and there was nothing he could do.  I simply asked him to come with me into the theater to see with his own eyes how dark it was.  He would not and did not.  I suspect this wasn't the first time he's heard this from a customer.  I've seen normal movies at this location before, but this was my first, and last experience with their 3D in room #1.",

There were people inside and the sign said open till 11pm, so we walked inside. It was like walking into the Twlight Zone, everyone stopped and stared at us. The woman behind the bar came over and told us they were closed. HUH! Ok.... so we left. It was very akward and unpleasant.

Thought that would transfer to this location - not at all.\n\nTo sum it up, our server was extremely energetic, but not in a good way. More like a frantic energy. I was there to enjoy a few drinks and dinner with a friend who was visiting (AKA looking to spend money AKA you will get a larger tip if you let us stay longer) and we were rushed out. Server brought boxes for food we were still eating, without asking if we wanted them. A few minutes later he physically put the food in the boxes at the tableside while mumbling something like \"I don't like food sitting on the table.\" .....we didn't even want to take it home. Next, when we said we were having another friend join for another round or two of drinks he told us we couldn't stay at the booth we were at and we needed to go to the bar. What? I point blank asked him if he was kicking us out of the booth and he said \"yes!\" energetically. There was no one waiting for tables and there were numerous open tables/booths around the restaurant. I felt extremely uncomfortable and wanted to leave immediately. Our friend joined after all this happened, and when the server came over to ask if they wanted a drink, he seemed surprised when we told him we were just going to leave. YOU LITERALLY just told us we couldn't sit at this table any longer!! We then left.\n\nI worked in restaurants for a long time and I'm pretty easy to please when it comes to restaurant service. I was not pleased at all during this visit.\n\nOn another note, the food was not that great.",

The bar is great, the staff friendly, but there is not a dish I have tried that is passable (although the asian shrimp wasn't bad, but very sweet). First visit we wrote off as a new restaurant working out the bugs. On our second visit I ordered a turkey burger and received a dry turkey patty. No one informed me that they were out of buns, but they could have at least tried to dress it up. It was seriously a lone piece of ground meat (to their credit, the manager did comp that meal). Today we received fish and chips that had to come out of a box and chicken salad that could have greased my axles!\n\nWe won't be back.",

Thin crust was not crunchy, olives were junk and salad was $6 for bad strands of lettuce and minimal cheese which looked horribly powdered. It came in a prepacked divider. Rip off. Not worth more than a dollar. \n\nTheir knots were ok, and extremely unhealthy, but rest was crap.\n\nI normally don't order from them or anyone else but good pizza like Grimaldi's, BJs or Mellow Mushroom but I hadn't gone grocery shopping and normally stock up on organic pizza from Publix or whole foods which btw is cheaper and tastier. But, this was the only place opened late. \n\nI never want dominoes again. It's just a reminder that corporate chains need to fall and get out the way. I rather pay for quality. Not preservatives and poison. \n\nNever Again!!! \n\nCalling card tomorrow to get refund! Waste of $30.",

    "text": "Never been to this location before, never had a problem with any other location. It was almost full but there were a handful of tables open. We began to seat ourselves and was told we could sit anywhere. They came and took our drink order pretty quickly and we received them within a few minutes, the girl who delivered our drinks said they would be back to take our order.  I'd say it was almost 10 minutes before they finally came and took out order. I started to wonder who our waitress was because 2 different females took the drink order and delivered them. Finally, one of the females came and took our order, so we must have been there for 15 minutes at least before our food order was taken. 10 minutes had gone by and a lady got sat in the booth next to us. Another 10 minutes later, she got her food before we did. So she got there after us, ordered after us, but received hers before us. Our waitress refilled my husband's coffee twice the whole time and she asked if I wanted a refill on my soda, I shook my head no and she could tell we were wondering where our food was, she says your food is almost ready, the kitchen is overwhelmed right now. But there was only maybe one new customer that came in since we had been there. I told my husband if we didn't get our food in the next 5 minutes, we would just leave.  So, 40 minutes and no food, we walked to the register and asked if we could pay for our beverages and our waitress said our food was almost ready. I said that we didn't want to wait anymore and she said we didn't have to pay for our drinks and we left. No apology, nothing. Im thinking either our waitress forgot to enter our order, or, the 3 cooks in the kitchen just wasn't concerned about how fast the food was being cooked. They did not look flustered, so I honestly don't know what the issue was. Won't be returning. Waste of our time.",

    "text": "I find it hard to believe there are so many people with such low standards when it comes to the Daily Bread.\n\nIt is a ripoff of St. Louis Bread Co/Panera Bread, which in of itself I don't mind at all.  I have eaten multiple times at the Daily Bread and have yet to have an enjoyable experience.  The food is so-so at best.  Their sandwiches are basic and lack any real flavor.  I also tried the BBQ Chicken pizza and it was okay.  \n\nI certainly wouldn't steer anyone away from this place based on the food.  The food is basic and simple, not bad but also nothing great.\n\nMy biggest qualm with the Daily Bread is the service.  The majority of the workers seem utterly uninterested in helping out.  There was a line of about 6 people and one person at the register.  There was no sense of urgency to help any of the customers in line.  We waited for a good 5-6 minutes to put an order in.  After receiving our cups to get our drinks we looked for a clean place to sit and eventually settled on a table top that was the least dirty of the tables available.  There were plenty of open spots but it just appeared as though there was lots of trash left behind.  Does anyone bus these tables?\n\nI anticipate that people are responsible for cleaning up after themselves, but it appeared as though the tables hadn't been effectively cleaned in a while.  There was also some trash on the floor that hadn't been addressed as well.\n\nThe order number was called and the order was only halfway completed.  When we asked which sandwich was ours, we were basically ignored as the girl put up two more orders.   After another few minutes the rest of the order came up and we began to eat.  I tried both items and as I stated before, both were okay.  The problem is that the food was just unable to make up for the lack of organization, the slow speed at which we were served, or the cleanliness of the restaurant.\n\nAfter 3 attempts, I'm writing the Daily Bread off and won't return.  I'd rather go to St. Louis Bread Co, get the same level of food, but in a clean environment and a timely setting.",

The one place you never cut corners is in the food, and that's exactly what they did. 2 of the 3 salsas were so watery that you didn't get any tomatillo or tomato on your chip, at all. The third salsa, the pics de gallo, was the worst chop job I've ever seen in a restaurant. Huge pieces of Serrano pepper with varying sizes of everything else, and in stark contrast to the other 2, completely dried out. \n\nWithout even looking at the menu, I know what I want... #15. That decision hasn't changed for over 10 years. Today I should have made a different choice. I'm not sure if they recently went thru a purveyor change but the quality of everything on the plate was horrible. \n\nI used to love the rice, it changed. I used to love the chicken quesadilla, now it's flavorless and covered in 2 lbs of cheese for 1/2 a breast.\n\nPlease go back to your old ways and cut costs elsewhere, other than the food.",

You are close to my house, have ample parking, and large spacious tables.  you even have a fireplace in the back for a little ambiance. \n\nfriends and i tried to come here 2 or 3 times for a quick/inexpensive* bite to eat and every time there was a 30-60 minute wait. we thought this must mean they are really good.  perhaps it just means that people in Springfield are willing to settle for a less than average dining experience.  *side note- this place is not inexpensive. \n\nhubby and i ordered apps- he got zinger boneless wings, and i got the guacamole. portion size was ENORMOUS on the guac - it could have served 8 people, seriously.  flavor was meh. apparently the wingz were good.  hard to tell what hubby enjoyed more, the wingz or the scantily dressed hostesses. \n\nour server was great, attentive and pleasant.  When something went wrong she did her best to fix it. That was much appreciated.   Side salad came out wilted and gross. management offered to take it off the check, would have rather had a decent salad in the first place but i digress.  Dinner was not very flavorful - at all - and portion sizes were okay. i got the quesadilla appetizer (which was plenty for an entree) but it was very sloppily put together and had no seasoning at all.  I have had food that is presented better and tastes better at fast food restaurants, where i am happy to pay $5 for a meal.  \n\nAt the end of the meal, i badly wanted dessert but didnt want to risk another poorly flavored dish.  Not to mention, all the dishes were like lunch tray plastic, and i felt that a $50-60 dinner for two was at least worth a nicer presentation. who knows, it may have even made up for the bland flavors. \n\nperhaps i was let down by the fact that there always seemed to be a wait and i had over hyped it in my head.  Never have i wanted to send back everything i ordered at a restaurant before this night.  i will never be back.  my husband says he will order the wings, but takeout only. no more dining in at this place.",

    "text": "I don't know this for sure, but my first impression of this place is that it is run by unscrupulous people. Come along with me, as I journey back in time -- all the way back to Wednesday...\n\nI step foot in this 7 Eleven, and the first thing I think is: this is one of the nicest looking 7 Elevens I've ever seen. It is very clean, bright, and spacious. Very nice looking selection of prepared meals. There were many that actually looked like they'd be quite good. But I wasn't hungry this day. No. All I needed were a few items. \n\nFirst, some good old TP. And let me be perfectly clear (as clear as Barack Obama): I DON'T buy the cheapest toilet paper because I'm cheap. I buy it because I like the way the cheap stuff feels. The more like sandpaper, the better. I like to feel like its working. I don't need to or even want to feel like an angel is up there. Or some perverted freak named Scott. \n\nIn any case, I got myself 4 rolls. And then I just needed one more thing - some plastic cups for a little party I'm having this weekend. \n\nI go ahead and drop my stash on the counter, begin to extract several singles from my wallet, when the cashier looks at me and says, \"24.99.\"\n\nI respond, \"That's not right.\"\n\nHe points at a price tag on the plastic cups which reads 19.99. I begin laughing. I tell him the price is clearly wrong. He tells me he's got to talk to his manager. Meanwhile, I tell the folks behind me waiting in line that I'm just going to go run and get different plastic cups to hurry the process along. Before he got back from doing his price check, I already had another cashier ringing up my two sleeves of cups for 1.99 each. That's more like it.\n\nAt around that same moment, the first cashier comes back from his consultation with his manager. He tells me that the price was, in fact, incorrect. And that the price is actually 14.99.\n\nTHAT'S the unscrupulous part.\n\nCLEARLY, THAT price is also far too high. His manager did no actual price check at all. He simply told the cashier to pretend that the real price was actually 5 dollars less, thinking that I'd be stupid enough to accept this. Why, because I'm white, and you're a racially superior Indian? You think white people are stupid don't you? We'll just believe what you tell us, and fork over our money.",

We walked in and were ignored by both people behind the counter. The girl (who seemed drunk) was throwing screwed up napkins around and one of them flew over the counter and hit me. No big deal, but no apology, just more hysterically loud laughter and napkin throwing. The guy noticed my son eyeing the candy and yelled at him not to touch anything. I get it, no one wants sandy little hands in the candy. But he wasn't touching anything, so this was just rude. We stood at the counter and the girl begrudgingly served us, no smile, no greeting, she didn't even look at us. Perhaps she was annoyed we had interrupted her flirting. She ran my card and then turned her back to do some weird dance for her work mate while we stood and waited, more loud shouty laughter. I'm all about a great fun atmosphere and I know I sound like a bore. But when it comes hand-in-hand with a rude attitude towards paying customers, it crosses a line.",

    "text": "Wow!  I just wrote a scathing review about El Patron Pizza in Tampa for leaving unwanted and unwelcome fliers under the door of unsuspecting tourist here in Tampa.  I was going to use a lot of the same issues for this review of New York Pizza Grill, but now I'm not sure what to say, only to say it carefully.  I knew there was something not quite right about the greasy looking punk that was meandering in the hallway of the 4 star hotel where I am currently residing.  As soon as I saw the flier I grabbed my room key and went looking for this person.  In hindsight that was not smart, as soon as I got a look at the guy, I ran for the elevator.  Now, I am no shrinking violet, but this guy looked like he's slap his own mother.  After reading the other reviews on here, I guess I should be happy that this employee didn't turn around and attack!  My biggest issue with this business is that they litter the halls and rooms with these fliers.  They sneak into hotels, a place where you feel safe and after this, I don't.  It doesn't seem to matter where it is a 5 star hotel chain or a family run business.  I did call every one of the pizza place that do this, because I felt bad about complaining to the staff at the hotel, but after yesterdays run in with greasy guy for New York Pizza Grill, I had it.  I do not feel safe and I told management that, and the did call the police.  So, for the employee of New York Pizza Grill, if you get caught stuffing fliers under doors where you are not invited and do not belong, you are more than likely going to be arrested.  So when you are out and about making not enough to keep your car running, ask yourself if your boss will bail you out of jail.  I doubt it, they'll probably just get another less than intelligent person to litter, trespass, annoy and sometimes terrify, hotel staff and their guests.  There are numerous reasons not to eat at New York Pizza Grill, but I'm just tossing out a good reason not to work for them.",

    "text": "The worst Italian food I have ever tasted!!! I'm far from Italian, but I can make a MEAN lasagna & spaghetti myself compared to this place. 1st of all, we waited 45mins patiently w/ a hungry Hubby, 2yr old, 7yr old, & myself. When we finally got seated, the waitress was very polite, but forgetful at times. Didnt drink any alcohol or sodas but the lemonade was very tart & the garlic bread was not-so-fresh...had to request for some fresh bread after my family devoured the 1st basket from starving & waiting for so long. I ordered the stuffed shells & chicken parmagiana. The salad was very tasty; however, they only have Italian dressing...no ranch or anything else. I am not a picky eater & rarely complain, but the stuffed shells & parmagiana chicken tasted HORRIBLE!! The chicken was very bland & the stuffed shells were hard & overbaked. The meranera sauce tasted like it was old or aged too long (if there's ever such a thing, lol). I could not bring myself to eat my entree. I had to send it back. I heard the lady at the table next to ours say the salmon was good, so I figured the salmon might be safe. It was actually very good! I was still very disappointed after this restaurant was referred to me by many. I felt like they got an easy $50 bucks out of me. I would have rathered gone to the olive garden or macaroni grill. If u r looking for an awesome authentic Italian cusine restaurant in Tucson, I highly recommend Contessa off of Ina Rd. The only reason we didn't go there is b/c it was out of the way from where we were going.  It's pretty far from where we live but always worth the drive. Everything is freshly made & u can definite tell the difference! I'm sorry Caruso, but I don't think my family will be coming here ever again!",

    "text": "This hotel was so terrible and I can narrow it down to 4 things:\n\n1. The price: Expect to pay a lot of money from the second you arrive. They charge $35 per person for a round trip shuttle ride to the airport. Our room was roughly $275 a night. It's an incredibly large hotel that offers a nail salon, a Godiva Chocolate store, about 9 restaurants and a few bars. But you'll pay dearly for any of those things - like $2.50 for a small bottle of soda. The hotel is designed to keep you in there and they charge you $15 for a round trip shuttle ride to the downtown Nashville area. \n\n2. The service: We called the front desk and were on hold for 20 minutes. We went to the front desk and waited in line for an hour. We waited around to ask the concierge questions. And each time we got, \"I don't know\" as the usual response. The cleaning staff was extraordinarily loud and they actually shouted as they went down the hall at 6:30 a.m.\n\n3. The name: They call this place a resort but that is, by far, a misnomer. This place is a convention hotel, period. It's horrifically loud at all hours of the day because they host about 3 conventions at one time. Our windows faced one of the courtyards and there is music pumping there 24 hours a day. The walls are thin and you can hear *everything* happening in the neighboring rooms. (eww!) If you want to relax at a resort, don't stay here because with all those convention people, loud cleaning staff, 24 hour music and thin walls you will only end up with more stress.\n\n4. The size: It's no joke that you will get lost in this hotel. It's inexplicably large. And when it hits noon, you should already be in one of the few restaurants because they fill up FAST. With several conventions happening at one time, getting a \"quick bite\" is not possible here. And there's not really any place close by, either. You can walk over to the mall for some fast food but plan enough time for your walk - getting out of the hotel takes at least 5 minutes.\n\nI'm sure glad I was there for a convention and didn't pay out of my own pocket for this ridiculous hotel.",

As a beginner in cooking I can judge this place's food is horrible. A day after the food looked like it had been out for weeks. Good food can last for a day or two.When i went in there to eat the hostess was nice. first, we ordered a glass a wine. he poured the wine, missed the glass and some spilled on the table and he just ignored it. hello. idiot. waitressing 101. go back. well needless to say. not worth your money at all. ive been there during happy hour with girlfriends and its fine. not a 'high end' restaurant by any means even though they try to make it that way.",

It's pseudo-Americanized versions of Mediterranean classic cuisine. The corporate chefs got so many things wrong:  Skordalia is a classic Greek dip made out of potatoes and garlic (not bread).  Avgolemono is chicken soup with egg, lemon and rice -- not this thin, awful broth they are currently serving. If one wants true Greek cooking, one should go to Greektown in either Detroit or Toronto. \nJust say no.",

    "text": "Ok. I am not the type to complain, but I have been here twice and both times I have had terrible service at the bar. The first bartender served me but acted as if I was bothering him.  This second time, with a completely different bartender mind you, it was worse. I am not dressed like a street person or anything, and I am not pan-handling. But you would think that I was the way he acted. First, I sit at the bar and I am waiting for service. So, the bartender walks by me, pours a glass a water, turns in front of me, puts the water down, gives me some stupid half-grin then walks off. Not one audible word of greeting or a grunt passed between his lips. Then, he gets a menu, drops that down and walks off again! Not a sound. Is it me, but when a customer enters an eating establishment, shouldn't they be greeted in some manner?  Not looked at like \"why are you here. I have better things to do\"?  I am not looking for a royal salute or anything. Just \"Hey man, what can I get ya?\"  or something to that affect.   Anyway, I start to look at the drink and food menus. Then, a group of anywhere from 10-15 people come in behind me and say, to what looked like a manager, \"We don't want to eat, is it ok if we just have a few drinks at the bar?\". The manager says \"Sure.\" The guy then says, \"Can we get few beers down here\"? (paraphrasing). The bartender says \"Sure!\" and proceed to service this group, one-by-one, as they order drinks. Ok, fine technically, I was looking at the menu when this started. But still, he walked back and forth, right in front of me, for about 10-12 minutes. Not once did he say, \"Hey, just shout and I will get you something\", or \"Hey man, just give me a few minutes and I will be right with you\". Nothing!  It was obvious it was a big group, but I mean, he gave no acknowledgement to the fact that I was sitting there waiting! \n\nLong story short - after this 10-12 minutes of waiting, I just walked out and went somewhere else. Now this place has about 4\\5 stars with around 500 reviews. So, I guess people like it. But their bartenders are as unfriendly as I have ever encountered.  Maybe if you get a table it's different.",

The bathrooms were filthy. There are 2 and one was not usable due to all of the paper towels that had been put into the toilet (there was no toilet paper). The other one was usable but also no toilet paper. Our server, Ashley, was not interested in providing any semblance of customer service...RUDE! We had a simple question about the beers on special and she became quite defensive. My daughter spilled her drink, which I realize is a pain in the ass for the restaurant and server (although we were outside so it wasn't that big a deal). We apologized profusely but she didn't even try to hide her annoyance. Finally, the chicken quesadilla should have been labeled the gristle quesadilla....more fat than actual meat...yuck.

    "text": "I have been to The Blind Tiger on multiple occasions for everything from business meetings to pleasure like this morning. It has a great atmosphere inside and is in a convenient location. And after this mornings experience, along with multiple subpar visits, I had to write a review. The staff's attitude is always hit or miss on whether or not they are having a good day. I walked in this morning about 30 minutes after opening. It was quiet inside because it is an early Sunday morning. I said good morning to the girl who looked like she was mad at the world. Okay, we all have bad days and this wasn't the first time experiencing this there so I blew it off. I stated that I wanted my order to go and order two drinks. I asked about a pastry which was told it was a guava and cheese (one of my favorites) so I ordered one of those too. I sitting outside and walked back in after a few minutes to check on my order. I saw that the pastry was boxed up (which I appreciate the personal touch of their logo on the box) and then was told my first drink was ready. It wasn't in a to go cup so it had to be fixed. Instead of the barista handing it to me at the counter where I grabbed the pastry and was waiting, maybe three feet from the barista, she made me walk down to her to grab the cup instead of her walking to me. I walked back outside to wait on my second order, came back in a few minutes later to my next drink just being finished. I told the barista that the drink looked beautiful from the design she made on top and got zero response. And no have a good day, thank you, nothing. Instead the ladies were talking about what food they wanted to eat. Again, I was the only one who they were waiting on because it was a Sunday morning. I left and began drinking my coffee and it wasn't hot and my boyfriend's wasn't either, but it wasn't worth going back after all of that. And to top it all off, when I got home to eat the pastry, it didn't have any cheese in it and barely any guava and I threw part of it away. What blows my mind even more is that they hold training classes for those who want to learn more about coffee. They should focus more on making sure their staff is performing up to expectations as today they failed in almost every way possible.",

The whole spa smelled like cement powder and the only spa option for is while we waited was the sauna/steam room. When we asked for a refund, the spa manager, Dawn, was aggressively rude to my mother as she said refunds were not an option. She offered us day credits but since we are from out of town, this wasn't a viable option. Only once we asked for the hotel manager and waited for almost 30 minutes at the checkin desk did someone (not Dawn) apologize for the hassle and let us know we wouldn't be charged for the treatments we didn't receive in a mostly facility unprepared to host us anyway. My prior experience with the spa was positive but now that they were so secretive about the true state of the facility and so stubborn about making it right, I can truly say I will never give them another chance...

We were sat and no one ever came to our table, I had to go get them, she got us the wrong appetizer, the food was awful and cold, everything took forever even though the restaurant was empty!!! The waitress was just terrible, I had to go find her several times. We almost got up and left and I wish we had! At the end of it our check was wrong and I never complain but when I did finally talk to the manager she didn't even care and did nothing about it. She didn't apologize or offer any kind of restitution. On our way out I did see that waitress was eating at a table, that would explain why she never came to ours!",

    "text": "My husband and I stopped here for lunch on a Saturday afternoon around 2-ish.  The restaurant was completely empty.  We inquired if they were even open and a nice lady said they were and proceeded to seat us.  \nTheir menu did not offer as many options of meat types or dishes as most Mexican restaurants do here in Indianapolis.  My husband ordered a margarita and the special of the day, Chilaquilles con salsa verde y pollo at $6.99 and I ordered a carne asada burrito at $7.99 and water to drink.\nChips and salsa were brought to the table.  Chips were  fried there, and while I like that style of chip (thin, often bubbles into thin layers) but were cold and very greasy.  Salsa was sweet but had some heat in the finish.  It was easy to eat a lot of those!\nWhen our meals came to the table, frankly, they were underwhelming.  My burrito tortilla looked/felt like it was not heated at all and cutting into my burrito was disappointing.  There was lots of lettuce and tomato, a scoop of a white rice (not spanish rice) and there was supposed to be mozzarella cheese in it but couldn't taste or see it.  The carne asada was thinner than a strip of bacon.  Unfortunately, I would be generous in saying there was maybe 2 ounces of beef.  In all honesty, there was no more meat in it than two strips of bacon, diced.  My husband mentioned it to the person (owner) with a quick \"sorry\" muttered and no offer to do anything.   While the combination of ingredients was not improperly prepared, there are 100 other Mexican restaurants in town I can spend $8.00 on a burrito and it would be generously filled with meat.\nAs for my husband's chilaquilles, I order this all the time from Biscuits in Broad Ripple and this was another disappointment.  This was chips, salsa verde, one fried egg and a very thin boneless piece of grilled chicken.  My husband felt as I did.  Not poorly prepared but completely lacking any substance.  During the time we spent in this restaurant, there was not one other customer coming or going.  With the lack of substance to the food, I suspect most people will feel as I did and would not waste their time coming back here.  There is no way this restaurant can survive when prices are the same as other Mexican restaurants but quality is far less.  Sadly, I was even mad that we spent $25.00 at this place and left just to drive to a fast food restaurant so we could get some quick, cheap protein.  \nI will chalk this up to a learning experience.  Folks, save your money and go to Rosita's or Margaritas U.S. 31, Leonardo's or even El Meson.",

You thought Parmesan cheese usually could be seen or when melted looked like it had been grated rather than an overdone mashed potato.\n\nWhen I asked the waiter, he said that those were not mashed potatoes, it was solid b\u00e9chamel, that they no longer put a liquid sauce on the dish.  I asked him why the menu said sauce and he just shrugged his shoulders.   Several minutes later the manager came by, offered the same lame story and offered to bring me something else.  When asked about the potatoes, just looked at me as if to say, you should have known Pastichio has potatoes.\n\nBy this time, I was and am pissed off that I was told twice I should have guessed about the mashed potatoes, and that b\u00e9chamel was not a sauce.\n\nMy cousin's Pasta Angelo was supposed to have \"grilled\" chicken, it was baked or cooked on a flat top.

The last caused us not to come back for over a year - and we should have stayed away.\n\nOn this Sunday evening, the restaurant was busy, but not jammed. There were five in our party, and we continually had to remind our server about things we were missing before our meals even arrived - butter, silverware sets, refills on beverages... \n\nI ordered a 13oz ribeye, rare, with only squash from the mixed vegetables. When it arrived 20 minutes later, the uneven piece of meat was medium rare on the thick end, and medium to well the rest of the cut - and I had a full serving of mixed vegetables with only one piece of squash. The manager took it to recook the order - and brought back a piece of meat so rare it was cold in the center and tough. I was hungry, so I chomped my way through.\n\nAnother steak was over-cooked, a third plate was missing sour cream and butter for a potato, cold shrimp on a fourth, and almost raw (crunchy) vegetables on the fifth.\n\nThe manager (Cody) apologized when he took my plate, but never checked back to see if my issue was resolved and for us to tell him about the other problems at the table. When the check arrived - full price. No offer of a dessert for the issues, nothing off the bill.\n\nWe will not be back. Jesse's is just a bit up the road, and the quality of both the food and the service are head and shoulders above this Outback.\n\nOne shout-out - Kate was great in helping to resolve issues, but she was tied up training someone else and we didn't see her again.",

These problems manifests as long waits for meals even during slow times, and getting orders wrong.\nThe last time (never again) I went in it was a slow morning, and it took them 45 minutes to get me my eggs, and when they came they were cold. I informed the cashier that my eggs were cold and I asked him if they could make me new eggs.  He said yes, and took my eggs.  He came back out with my same plate, and it was evident that he microwaved the plate with the toast and fruit on it; the toast was soggy, and fruit warm. I returned my food, and have vowed to never return.",

We went during Sunday happy hour and I specifically asked our waitress about specials and she told me brunch was over and there were no other specials. Come to find out there was a whole happy hour menu and 2 of the beers we ordered were on happy hour but we were charged full price. The waitress was not apologetic, just annoyed when I confronted her and said \"I didn't know you wanted happy hour\". I was confused because it is the first thing I asked her whenever she finally decided to greet our table.  She also rarely came to our table to check on us.

    "text": "I've been eating here when I'm in town for about 5 years and this place used to be great. The food has severely gone downhill in not only quality of ingredients but also in ability to prepare a dish. I ate here for lunch today, saying that so hopefully a member of the staff reads this and remembers me, I ordered the dry hot pot and my gf ordered fried dumplings and the cold noodles with chili oil and we shared each other's food. The mushrooms in my dish were impossible to cut even with a knife and the rest of the vegetables had a freeze dried feel to them being the consistency of bark. The pork was a bit rubbery and only had flavor from the oil draped over everything that seemed under seasoned as well and definitely tasted old. This was labeled in the menu as a 10/10 spicy rating, it was at most a 2. I didn't bother saying anything because of how rude the waiter/host was, but I'll get to that. The rice was cold and clumped together in chunks that led me to understand that it was previously microwaved. The dumplings looked ok, but the dough was undercooked and the sauce was just soy sauce that had no care whatsoever put into it. Her noodles were very bland and whoever prepared them obviously doesn't care about their food. The noodles had the same flavor deprived oil from my dish in it, just disappointing really. This type of food is supposed to be robust and I've eaten at a ton of places across the country and internationally that do care about what the put out. This place doesn't care anymore. The man that seated us was incredibly rude the entire time. He huffed and puffed and stomped his feet when I asked for the real Chinese menu instead of the Americanized Chinese menu. And, they used to throw shade if you asked for the Americanized menu, now it's the opposite. After we were done we both had a decent amount of food left and I decided to take it to feed to the raccoons that come around my house. They look cool and I like to feed them. Anyway, the take out container was dirty from previous food in it! I was blown away, especially when I pointed it out and the rude person pretending to be a man grabbed it out of my hand and stormed, literally stormed off before I was even half way through my sentence. I was calm the whole time, not sure what this guys deal is. Then came back with the same container that he washed! He washed the dirty container that should never have been used in the first place and thought that was acceptable. I will never go here again and I hope they go out of business so no one has to be punished by this Handy Nasty food. Disgusting food and disgusting people, except for the one guy who worked there who said goodbye to us. He seemed mortified because he knew what the cuck host just did to everyone in the dining area throughout the day and I assume throughout his life. I hate this place, and I can only hate it because I used to love it.",

I will be going back to the papi stores and getting a much better cheesesteak for half the price. And they should be ashamed for fleecing people for using credit/debit cards.

    "text": "We have loved Schlafly for many years as we lived just blocks away and love their beer and food. So, when we had guests in town, we decided to drive a bit and take them to Bottleworks on a nice fall day to enjoy a few drinks before dinner at our place. What in the heck happened to this place? Saturday afternoon, the patio was about 2/3 full, but we got a 30-45 minute wait for 15 people including a few babes. On top of that, we were told we had to order food if we sat on the patio. Fine, we will order a few appetizers. Nope, it had to be entrees. After promising to make it up to the server and tip well, we were given a pager. Waited 45 minutes to be seated as we watched tables sit empty. Once seated, some of our group ordered entrees because the server made them feel bad, so that made the meal I already had prepared completely worthless. The topper was when we got our checks, the server told us we were not as bad as she expected and to come back again when we got babysitters for the babies. So is there some new trend in hospitality to treat your guests like this that should make them want more? \nI do hold a special place in my heart for this place as we used to walk there with our kids all the time and even hit up their markets and other events, but I was so embarrassed for talking this place up the way I did and actually driving more than a mile to go here. Surely, Schlafly realizes that there is another great brewery right down the street that has a much better vibe and appreciation for their guests. Live and learn.",

    "text": "I have never been so insulted and talked down to in my life. Michelle, I think that's her name it's on my receipt but she never introduced herself, was the rudest person I have ever given my money to in my life. When we sat down she was talking about personal issues with the barback loud enough for us to hear and I thought that was odd in and off itself. When she gave us our menus she said a few times \"these menus are good for the next 30 seconds.\"  Sorry but either give us brunch or give us dinner menus and explain that the kitchen is in the midst of a shift change, don't make us feel pressured because you dropped menus that have an extremely short time limit. Instead of eating we decided to just get drinks. She let us know that the brunch menu libations were, her words, 2 for 1. We ordered a mimosa off the list and hung out. When we got get drinks they set two wooden tokens down but didn't reference the at all, so we didn't know what they were for.  Eventually ordered some food off the dinner menu to go. She was very non existent the whole time we were sitting at the bar, not attentive at all. When we asked for the bill I saw that both our drinks were on there. I asked about them and let her know about the 2 for 1 statement she said. She then proceeded to tell me it was buy one, get one and that's what the tokens are for. I told her that \"buy one get one\" and \"2 for 1\" are different and if we knew it was BOGO we would have ordered another drink (if she would have even paid attention to us).  After a little back and forth she said she would take care of it and that \"they weren't trying to screw us.\"  She talked to us like we were the worst people on earth because she doesn't know how to explain her own restaurants policies. I work in an industry that has me visiting 10-15 bars/restaurants/hotels a day and I have never had a worse hospitality experience in my life. Tavern Management - this employee is losing you revenue left and right.  Not only is she not taking care of customers and grabbing reorders, she is turning people away for good. This treatment was so horrible and off putting that I am going to go out of my way to recommended against going to Tavern due to the disrespect we felt. Hopefully your floor managers recognize how bad she is and theyo do something about it because she is taking money out of your pocket every shift she works.",

    "text": "Disappointing experience. Pastries (had the croissant, eclair, cannoli) are okay but nothing amazing. Dining area is small. Very limited drink options. I agree with previous reviews that it is very reminiscent of break-room coffee with 2 pump pots full of coffee and buy-in-bulk tea bags.  \n\nReally what soured the experience was the counter staff.  After my SO and I purchased several pastries, coffee, tea and went to sit down, the staff informed us that we couldn't stay because they were closing. The sign says 5pm, this was at 4pm.  She assured us that it was just that day they were closing early.   No apology. Just informed us and walked away. After all this, I had to remind her that I was still waiting for a cup of hot water to steep my warehouse earl grey tea in. We came to the cafe to sit and enjoy tea and pastries so it was obviously a disappointment to get kicked out before the advertised closing time.  I would have greatly appreciated being informed of the earlier hours prior to making a purchase or at least in the form of a sign. Would much rather enjoy a pre-made croissant and better drink options at the adjacent Starbucks or PJs. Lesson learned.",

The place was over crowded because they over sold tickets. We were asked to move from where we were standing because it would block the dancers from walking by. However, they brought out chairs from the back for other people to sit in that same exact spot. The second time we were asked to move because a couple wanted to sit behind us and couldn't see. A woman then turned a chair around and told one of my friends that the seat wasn't for her in a very rude tone. Next, two girls came in and stood directly in front of me which was also directly in front of the doorway where the dancers were supposed to enter, a server came to us and asked us to move again but said nothing to the two girls. We stated that we could not move where he wanted because then we would be blocking the view of the customers already standing there so he then asked us to move to the back of the bar where we would not be able to see anything. After that the rude woman (who told my friend the seat wasn't for her) had her husband tap my friend and ask could she switch places with me because she was too tall and blocking everyone's view. There was no room for us to switch spots so I said no and continued to try to watch the \"show.\" \nHe then tapped her again and asked did she want to sit down, she said no she was fine. He proceeded by pushing the chair into the back of her legs and forcing her to sit down. There was no staff around to assist us with these issues and there was hardly any room to try to find someone so we left before things got anymore out of hand. As we stood outside getting ready to leave a couple that lived next door overheard us talking about how disrespected we felt they chimed in and said that many of the people there are impolite and rude. I will never again in my life recommend nor visit this establishment.",

Unfortunately, I forgot that this is the Penn Relay weekend (huge mistake). After driving 1.5 hour and taking 30 minutes to find a $15 parking space, I finally arrived. The place was not too packed but half the patrons were gathered around the ordering counter. It took me a few minutes to realize that this increadibly roudy, vulgar bunch had aready placed their orders but were just hanging out at the counter, thus preventing newly arrived customers from placing their orders. I tried my best to get noticed and to get to the counter but had no luck. Ultimately, I and a few other customers (or should I say \"potential customers\" eventually gave up and left. The cincher for me was that the staff were clearly aware of what was occurring but made no attempt to control the crowd. I may have waited if the staff showed some business savvy and kept the counter area clear but unfortunately, they appeared overwhelmed and confused. i've eaten at the Jerk Hut several times (food is OK-good) but this visit left a bad taste in my mouth so I may have to reconsider future trips across the bridge for authentic JA CUISINE!!\nPS: Memo from prior visits, their wait staff can be a bit rude.",

I called and spoke to a manager on duty about these fees and she refused to refund the fees since I checked the terms and conditions box on the reservations page. I informed the MOD that I had neglected to read all of the terms and conditions, therefore she refused to help.

When they don't have them and you sub extra white rice and they just open box and through them in on top. What a joke!",

    "text": "The only reason for one star is it is the only way the review would post. We had long ago decided not to return to the Avon location after three disappointing visits. We frequented the Lafayette location often and were very disappointed in the service and quality of the Avon location where we now reside.  Tonight we followed our daughter and her family to the Avon location (unaware of where they had decided to go for dinner). This evening topped  the list of terrible restaurant experiences-over an hour wait for food, my daughters steak was cooked well done when ordered medium rare, the steak was remade which had to be boxed and was left at the table because was still cooked incorrectly.  She was charged 9.99 for the remake and that is what was taken off her bill not the price of the original steak&rib dinner.  I ordered the apple pie desert with ice cream which came out before we even received our drinks and without a spoon.  My husband drove back to the location where the manager refused to do anything different about the original charge for the incorrectly cooked steak; needless to say my husband left with the owners phone number.  Mistakes happen - but own them; every bad experience is related to over 20 people, who then in turn, repeat to someone else - so tell me manager of Avon, IN Texas Roadhouse - was it worth it?",

The first time I showed up I was told they were closed for a Spring Spruce up and would be open on the 11th. I left a little annoyed because there was no indication of this on their website, which I had used to look them up and browse the menu. I later discovered they had something up on their Facebook page about being closed, but seeing as those I don't have a Facebook, this was of no benefit to me. Today (March 15th) I drove all the way over only to discover a sign on the door stating they will be closed the remainder of the week! This time I checked their Facebook and there was no information regarding the extended closure. In fact it was a bit confusing because they had posts advertising the re-opening and even pictures posted of people eating there for a brunch event just the other day. Is this some kind of secret society of delicious eatery? I really wish I knew. Poor communication on the businesses side of things has made me feel like I probably won't be giving these guys a try. If I do muster up the fortitude to drive clear across town again I will definitely be calling ahead to make sure they are open. I suggest you do the same.",

    "text": "first off the service is absolutely terrible. the waiter only came over to take our order and bring us our drinks and food. after that when we needed something we practically had to look around to hunt him down during our entire meal. he never bothered to come over to check on us to see if we needed drink refills or how our food was. even when we wanted our check he was no where to be found. \nas for the food; my sister had ordered the clam chowder and she had to send it back and asked them to reheat it because it wasn't even warm, it was room tempature. than between the 5 of us we had ordered other dishes and 20 wings (4/person) well there was definitely 20 piece of chicken on the plate; if you count the one tiny piece that looks like the very tip of the chicken wing that usually gets thrown out. \nwhen we brought it up to the waiters attention; after having to look for him for 15 mins, his response was the chefs usually cooks a big batch at a time so they probably miscounted so he'll bring us another wing. we waited another 15 minutes before finally getting his attention to ask for our check and a couple boxes. so by now we have leftovers all packed up and money in the check sleeve ready for the waiter to take. i wanted to leave a feedback with the manager on duty there about our meal so I asked a waitress to get the manager for me since our waiter wasn't around. now we are pretty much ready to leave and the one piece of wing never came out; that is until our waiter overheard us asking for the manager. because as soon as the manager got to our table so did the one piece of chicken wing soaked in oil. \nwhen we told the manager about the wings he pretty much brushed it off and laughed in our face and said \"I guarantee the chefs didn't count this as a wing\" and that \"they probably just shorted you guys a wing and so someone else here got that extra wing\". it was 20 wings for $20 so his solution was telling us he'll take a dollar off our bill if we wanted. \ni felt like that was a slap to my face and I felt a little discriminated, like if I wasn't asian things would've been different. I wasn't looking for any type of discount or freebie, all i wanted to do was give a feedback to the manager so he knows they should be more careful since this wasn't the first time they \"miscounted\" (in the past I've been shorted on wings and shrimps)\ntonight is the last time I'm ever eating/drinking here and i will no longer be recommending people to come here.",

I'm thinking I'm getting a veggie burger nope it's just onions peppers mushroom on a bun. Super disgusting! It was almost $50 for us to eat at a fast food joint and the food was gross!  I could have went to Mcdonalds and had dessert lunch and breakfast for that price and had a better meal. My husband used to work at a 5 guys in SC and as I remember the fries came with the burger as a meal fresh in a bag and the burgers were huge!

This restaurant is extremely small, and if there aren't any seats, you are welcome to stand in the back by the bar without seating, in the way of all the commotion. We stood by the bar for about ten minutes before we were asked if we needed something. We wanted to eat, but not standing up. We saw multiple tables open up, and had to ask if we could sit there, even though we were the only people waiting. We finally sat, and a young,brunette waitress came and took our order. We wanted two orders of the Short Rib fries appetizer, since we would be having it as our dinner opposed to sharing it, and she looked at us like we asked her to bring the whole cow to our table. She asked us if we were sure that we wanted two, and we confirmed that we did. The first order came out in about 5 minutes which was amazing. 10 minutes went by, then 15, and our server didn't even come over to see how our first dish was, just stood in the corner chatting. We got another servers attention after 20 minutes of waiting and let him know we were still waiting on our order. We also advised him that if it wasn't ready, to forget about it and we would share the first one. He came back and told us that it would be out any second. Another ten minutes went by, still no dish, still nothing from our original server. We let the young man know that we were no longer interested in the dish that was 25 minutes late, and then our original server finally decided to come over! Could you believe the first thing she said was \"so im hearing that you never got the second batch of fries?\". As if it was some kind of rumor. Then had the nerve to ask if we still wanted it. She took it off the bill but I was extremely disappointed with the service, and will certainly not return the next time I am in town. Especially since I got sick in the middle of the night from it.

    "text": "We visited the Ihop on Canal Street after a day of traveling and were seated by a friendly waitress. In our group, there were two adults and four children, ages 14, 13, 5 and 3. The waitress brought our drinks and took our order quite efficiently. When the food arrived, one five-stack of buttermilk pancakes were missing. My daughter had to sit and watch everyone eat for some time, while the waitress made promises each trip past our table. Knowing she was starving, I finally gave her one f my three pancakes so she had something in front of her while she waited.\n\nFinally, her order arrived and she began eating. The waitress left my bill on the table - $54. I had ordered the Colorado Omelette which was quite good but when I finished most of it and started on my pancakes, I got a nasty nasty surprise. With the second bite of my pancakes, something felt wrong in my mouth. I reached in and found a hair. I started pulling it out of my mouth and it kept coming and coming, like a fishing line!!! UGH MY GAWD. The thing took both hands and turned out to be a curly reddish hair. It was not mine nor the waitresses as it had obviously been cooked into the pancake. This made me sick to my stomach, of course.\n\nI called the waitress over and showed her. She quickly told me the hair did not match anyone on duty (WHO CARES ABOUT THAT? THE DAMN THING WAS IN MY FOOD!) She asked me if I wanted to speak to the manager and I said no, please just take this food away from the table. She did not ask me if I wanted a replacement (even though I would have said no, it would have been nice if she had offered). She came back to the table a few minutes later and picked up the $54 check, leaving another in its place. I thought maybe she had took my meal off of the bill but NO - now my total was $63.89. Listed as a service charge was $7.73 - she had included her own gratuity after the hair was found. \n\nIHOP used to be my ultimate favorite restaurant but now it just makes my stomach churn and brings back a memory I cannot erase. I will never, ever return to this restaurant and unless something changes in the future, I will never eat at another IHOP err... IHAIR again!!!  \n\nAnd since when did IHOP start adding gratuity into their checks?????????????????",

Our waiter approached asking if we wanted drinks and ordered water. After waiting nearly 20 minutes our waiter returned requesting our order, as she sat down menus.. We politely informed her that we did not receive menus and would need time to order. She indicated she would return in a moment to place our order. After another 10 minutes she returns and took our order. My salad was right however we were not provided utensils, which I had to go fetch myself. My husband also inquired if a specific game could be showed on the tv. Our waitress stated she would check and returns to tell my husband he would need to ask all 8 folks sitting at the bar if it would be okay to change one of the tvs that's showing the same things as 2 other tvs. The final thing that has disappointed me and caused me to waste my time to make this complaint is that 2 men who arrived nearly 5 minutes after us placing our order were provided their food (nachos) before us who also had ordered one nacho. \n\nContacted management with no response!

The male bartender was super apathetic and seemingly annoyed by our existence...ex: when taking our brunch order he just walked up and said \"Food?\" In general he couldn't be bothered to interact with us, let alone do it with any hospitality. \n\nLousy drinks --  the mimosas are a ripoff. We ordered a carafe, but it was 90% juice, only the neck was topped off w/ sparkling wine. We're not ordering juice here, people, we're ordering drinks! A mimosa should be mostly sparkling and topped w/ juice. I asked if he could add more but his adjustment made no difference. But here's the kicker -- when a friend of the apathetic bartender sat next to us, she was welcomed with smiles and jovial hospitality, and when she ordered a mimosa guess what she got? 90% sparkling wine, topped with juice! You know, the way they're supposed to be made.\n\nClearly there's no front-of-house manager to oversee and ensure good service.\n\nFood-wise, it's meh. The forgettable $13 & $15 entrees didn't come with sides, so you gotta pay extra to have potatoes or grits or bacon w/ those eggs.\n\nSorry guys, but New Orleans is a food and hospitality town....You aren't even trying. I don't imagine Morrow's will be around unless you step up your game in a major way. (and writing yourself fake reviews wasn't the solution -- glad Yelp removed them!)",

I called last night to see how long the wait was, and was told that there was no wait. So my friends and I drove all the way across town for dinner at 8 pm. As soon as we asked for a table, we were told that they were out of deep dish. What?! How does a restaurant run out of their signature menu item?! And how did the person who answered the phone fail to tell me that when I called to ask about the wait? I would have appreciated the warning and would probably have delayed my 312 dinner for one more day. \n\nWe love the deep dish pizza so much that we decided to stay and try the thin crust. It wasn't until after we ordered, though, that our waitress told us it would be an hour wait! We know that's the deal for the deep dish, but it was doubly disappointing to get to the restaurant, find out they don't have deep dish, and then have to wait an hour for the thin crust (which was okay, but would never have made it on my short list to hit before leaving town).\n\nAll in all, it was a disappointing night for what has been one of my favorite Nashville spots. Big bummer.\n\nTL; DR:  call before you go and ask whether the restaurant is still serving deep dish because apparently 312 sometimes runs out of the crust.",

We asked for sweet and low with one of our unsweet teas and didn't receive it. Had to ask for it again to then receive the sweet and low. We ordered the bloomin onion and the chesse fries. The bloomin onion was not the onion the restaurant usually uses because it was on the spicy side. The chesse fires when on the ok side since they did not put much chesse or bacon on the appetizer. So in all reality we ordered a plate of fires with a little chesse and bacon. My grandmother ordered the 6oz steak and it was also on the spicy side. I however ordered the same thing but I ordered mine medium rare but when I got my steak it was rare instead of medium rare and also was really spicy.  We then had to ask for a bottle of steak sauce because if you ask for steak sauce for a party of three you will only get one tiny cup full of steak sauce for the whole table. Had to order a to go order for my father couldn't make it to lunch and our waiter said he would put it in after we had finished our meal. When we finished our food and the waiter gave us our check we still haven't received our to go order. Had to sit and extra five to ten minutes to get that said order. Lets just say we gave a bad tip.

The actual huevos rancheros base is flavorless. My over easy eggs were, in my most generous interpretation, over medium. The conservative helping of goat cheese (allegedly a main ingredient in the deluxe) was extremely low quality, smelling and tasting of goat the way very low quality goat cheese is wont to do. The lox had (surprise!) apparently been marinated in some kind of lime mixture, plus had been heated, possibly sauteed. The whole thing was *covered* in capers. Take a moment to imagine these flavor combinations. And it cost $13. \n\nThe emperor has no clothes.",

Nope he just came to the table and said oh sorry and walked away!!!!  \n\nHis name is Amonte or something like that!!! \nI don't mind paying whatever for a good meal but this is ridiculous!!!!

Yep. Food. \n\nShe continued on with what she was doing: the grueling task of flipping tortillas on a grill. I full expected the woman's head to twist a complete 360 degrees, a trick I once saw in the movie \"The Exorcist\".

    "text": "I'll start this off by saying I've worked in the food industry as a server, bartender, expo, busser, dishwasher, etc for 10 plus years. I now work with disabled persons trying to help them find employment. We're not supposed to meet them in their home as per company policy. My client, who is disabled, and I have visited this pizzeria a few times per her request because it's close to her house and she feels comfortable meeting there. Today we went in at 1:45pm and I noticed it was busier than usual (typically we go at a time where it is not busy restaurant hours.) Before going to sit down like we normally do, and again this was only our third time here, We were greeted aggressively and immediately by who I assume is the owner. I started to ask \"do you mind if we sit here..\" and was cut off. He said, \"I have a real problem with you coming in here not buying anything and sitting taking up a table for 2-3 hours.\" (Mind you, we have never been there the previous 2 times over an hour and 15 minutes - as I have a limited amount of time I am able to work with each client.  There also has been about 15 other open tables in the restaurant each time we were there, including today.) This person responded very hostile and aggressive. Had the gentleman asked politely if I purchased a drink or a slice of pizza we could sit and go about our business, however he met me with an extremely volatile attitude and aggressive choice of words. Again, as someone who's worked in the food industry, I understand how it can be frustrating for someone to come in and sit without purchasing anything. With that said, how this employee decided to treat me in this moment made me and my disabled client extremely uncomfortable. The rudeness was completely unnecessary and being familiar with the industry I wouldn't have minded at all purchasing something from this place in order to sit there for an hour, had I been spoken to appropriately. The part I feel the worst about is how my client was treated. I had to explain to her why \"that man was so rude\". It's unacceptable how me and my client were made to feel today. She's already treated differently in the world and she felt terrible after this interaction. I'm mortified that this had to happen in this way, and this whole situation could have been completely avoided had we been treated like human beings. What the employee was trying to say was completely justified, however we were yelled at and made to feel like we were unwelcome for no reason whatsoever. I will not be entering this restaurant again for obvious reasons, and I encourage anyone who has any empathy for disabled persons to do the same. Again, the way we were treated was completely reprehensible and could have been avoided completely.",

    "text": "Super excited to try this place while in town for 24 hours. We sat at the small 12 person bar and it took awhile for someone to take our drink order as there was only one bartender on a Saturday night. About 5-6 servers did say hi to us though. Drinks were fine. Apps came out which was the shrimp cocktail and meatballs. Meatballs were under cooked shrimp cocktail was fine. I ordered the chefs cut 20oz bone in ribeye with a chili rub and the wife ordered the filet with one of their toppings of cheese and peppers. The ribeye came out on a cold plate so I sent it back and the manager came over and apologized profusely. The best thing about the wife's filet was the cheese on top. She ordered it med rare and it came out slightly above rare. My steak came back out. I always order mine rare at steak houses and this was like a soggy sponge. Literally couldn't swallow more then 3 bites. The actual cut of steak was one of the worst cuts I've ever seen. The steak was bland. I had to ask multiple times what the rub was because I couldn't taste anything not even salt or pepper.  The beans that came out with the steaks were under cooked and hard. Needless to say I actually didn't eat dinner. The server came and picked up my full plate of steak and threw it away. The chefs cut was 50 bucks. And the total bill was 150 I literally spend that much at least once a week on food so that's not a big deal.  But I would rather spend 150 bucks on double quarter pounders with cheese and have to eat them all in one sitting then eat anything at this place again.  From start to finish it was horrible.",

After ordering, my friend and I were told that \"nothing was prepped\" and it would be 25 more minutes. We said we did not mind waiting. We waited an hour but nothing was ever \"prepped\", except Mac and cheese or charcuterie. We had the charcuterie and left. There was no attempt to make things right or explain. Very strange experience and poor/ no customer service. The waiter was nice though, and I felt sorry for him.",

    "text": "Ruined our Friday happiness. \n\nThought it would be nice to go to Friendly's for a family meal to start the weekend...but the moment we arrived, I knew we should have left. \n\nTwo employees at the front were talking to themselves, ignoring to greet us. When a 3rd employee asked his colleague where to seat us, she clearly wasn't eager to have us in her section, then she caught my eye as she then knew I heard her. \n\nWe were guided to our table -- right next to the kitchen entry...meanwhile 1/2 the place was empty, as we passed by booths with \"broken\" signs on them and other dirty, uncleared tables. I asked to be seated at another booth--so we then were seated 1 row over from the kitchen entry... \n\nThe initial \"Hi, I'm so-and-so\" was fine and we ordered our 3 meals and waited. Drinks arrived -- my glass of Coke was chipped and the other glass of Sprite tasted terrible, like seltzer. Asked for another Sprite and got the same terrible drink. \n\nLater, I spotted our 3 meals on the warmer (remember, we are sitting 1 row away from the kitchen...) and ironically the warmer shelf is next to a clock. 6:02pm. Waited and waited...server finally walked by and I had to let her know that our meals were ready -- \"Let me check,\" she says.  6:04pm. She goes missing...then she brings 2 of the 3 plates to our table and disappears again. I had to waved down another server and asked for my plate, still sitting on the warmer. 6:06pm. That server goes missing. Our original server finally brings my plate. Burger with the wrong cheese...over-cooked waffle fries. (Or maybe fries were over-cooked and dry from sitting under the warmer for 5 minutes as I stared at it.) Turkey BLT was subpar and the kids chicken fingers were over-cooked too. \n\nI'm surprised the server came by later and asked how our meals were (albeit robotic) but not surprised that when we said I got the wrong cheese, she said \"sorry\" without any suggestions or offers to make good on her mistake. \n\nWe were ready to pay and eager to leave...we waved down another server who said she couldn't take our payment as our assigned server had to do it. We said \"Can you let her know?\" and she said \"I can't, she's with another table\" and walked away. We were in disbelief that this experience just got worse. \n\nThe only good memorable moment was when I said under my breath \"This place is terrible,\" and my young son repeated me. \n\nAdvice: Hire people who are actually Friendly or shut it down. This is an embarrassment. Will never go there again and probably never go to another Friendly's ever.",

Long long times, tight crowds, lots of dogs and babies. We circled the event trying to pick out which line we were going to devote our entire night to standing in, and decided on the Jamaican truck. After an hour of standing in line, and having other line go-ers friends casually jip us, we finally made it to the front to order only to have the vendor announce they were out of all of my meal options.\n\nSo you know what I had for dinner the evening of Night Market? A bag of chips from CVS.\n\nThis event had it's potential. But I guess they were not counting on the ridiculous horde of hungry people. Most trucks were placing \"SOLD OUT\" signs just as we were arriving. There were very few vegetarian/vegan options... (actually, don't believe any food vendors had vegan options).

Had no problem getting in & now I know why.\nWe had one of the worst meals & I spent almost $180.00.\nWe sat outside, which was charming, except  we felt  lucky when the waiter showed up at our table. He was rushed & apologized for the lack of wine choices.\nThe bread was wonderful...\nThe Osso buco was hard, dry & so salty it was inedible.\nSent that back, the waiter was nice about it, brought back the Scallop dish which was still oversalted &  really bad. \nThe side of grilled, Burnt, slimy asparagus was also salty & over cooked. And I truly wanted to send it back because it was horrible....did I mention cold?\nBut we were starting to get in a hurry to leave so we could wash out the bad taste in our mouth.\n\nMy chicken dish was better than a microwave one from Big Lots, but the chicken was chewy, rubbery, 4 sure Not Organic, Farm Raised... Must be steroid chicken , no taste, and I cannot remember the name of the dish, I believe it had a few morsels of pasta with it.  Ughh...\n\nThe 1 star is for our waiter , he was OK, but I am SO OVER egoist, affected, waiters telling me about their view on wine, when they obviously have NO clue.\nI mention a Gaja Barberesco & he suggests the Amarone. And he continued with a Soliloquy on all the names of Top Italian Wines he knew & 10 minutes go by &  Guess what, they did not offer 1 of the them on their wine list!  So he wastes time trying to show me He Knows wine's names, but Timpanodoes not carry them.\n The Beat thing I orderes was the cocktail I had in the beginning with Elderflower liquor, a splash of soda muddled mint &  cucumber. That was so refreshing.\n My associate polished most of the Wine choice off her self. Which was good and was priced ok, I think the bottle was around $40.00. \nTheir wine list is minimal.\n We expected an Italian Restaurant but it was more a New York Steak House.The food was ordinary, over salty, waaay over priced. And don't get me started on the Duo they booked 4 entertainment...\nBottom line, That area of Hyde Parkis in construction & renovation so STAY AWAY. Wait 4 Goody Goody 2 open!

Needless to say, I ignored the signs and ate here.  This was literally the worst Thai food I have had in my entire life.  \n\nFirst, I ordered the tom yum soup.  They asked me how spicy I wanted it and I responded that I wanted it spicy.  I did not expect that the entire bowl of soup would be covered in red pepper flakes.  Disgusting. I spent ten minutes picking red pepper flakes out of the soup and my mouth.  \n\n  I also tried the chicken satay.  The chicken was ice cold and as dry as beef jerky. The dipping sauce was a mix between curry and Planter's honey roasted peanuts.  It was a bizarre combination like nothing I've ever had before.  Once again...Disgusting. \n\n  Finally, I ordered curry.  I had high hopes that they could not screw up everything in my order.  Boy was I wrong.  The curry was bland and just plain gross. \n\nOverall, all 8 of the people in my group left the restaurant dissatisfied.

    "text": "My fault for falling for the $6.99/lb filet (or maybe another cut, it was a month ago and I can't remember that specifically) and buying 2 (one for me, one for fiance).  Shame on me for not cooking it on the day I bought it, apparently.  Because when I DID go to cook it the next day (yes, that's right) it had turned brown and smelled awful.  Note that the other items in my fridge were fine (including other raw meat), so I suspect this was on its last legs when I purchased it.  Did I worry about being able to return it?  No...I go in there all the time (laziness and convenience) and in fact had been there 4 times that weekend because I was baking something and kept forgetting key ingredients.  \nSo I went in, without my receipt, to ask if I could exchange it for a fresher piece of meat (I really had my heart set on steak).  Tito, the manager, gave me a super hard time about not having the receipt...I explained that I'm not used to having to keep the receipt in case the food I bought was SPOILED, but he didn't care.  He then proceeded to tell me that maybe it was my fridge, that I really needed to receipt, and to generally balk at my attempt to politely receive a refund or new steak.  Finally, he gave in and I got 2 new steaks, but that wasn't the end.  He stopped me to inspect them on my way out and started saying again how he thought I had either left them in my fridge, or my fridge was broken.  I commented that if I had the same issue at DiBruno Brothers, I wouldn't be put through this grief, to which he responded, \"Well, we aren't DiBruno Brothers\".  No shit.  I emailed them and commented and of course heard no response.  I really wish that the little grocery at 20th and Spruce was better stocked, because I this place blows and I don't enjoy going there.

    "text": "This was possibly the worst experience I've ever had at any restaurant. \n\nGeneral disappointments: They were out of orange juice, diet coke, and to go boxes. Someone waited twenty minutes to order food to go and then overheard the staff tell someone else they were out of to go boxes and couldn't accommodate any take out orders. (I think all customers would have appreciated knowing upfront that these items and services were unavailable.)\n\nService disappointments: While our initial interaction with our waitress was seemingly standard and friendly, I can't provide any additional positive feedback about her because we barely saw her again.The waiter who brought us our beverages informed us of their lack of diet coke and forgot 2/3 waters. We spent over 35 minutes trying to make eye contact with our waitress to get her attention - and although we made eye contact, she never came over.\n\nWe spent 45 minutes waiting for refills on water and coffee (and of course our food), while other customers who had been seated after us and were simply sitting closer to the kitchen enjoyed their food. At this point I stood up and walked over towards the kitchen to request refills, and a different waitress said she would be right with us. Ten minutes later our waitress came over with refills and said our food shouldn't be much longer. \n\nThis is now 55 minutes into our breakfast. (Just to be clear we all ordered eggs and the restaurant was not full.) While she was at our table we requested a set of utensils (since only 2/3 of our party was given a set of utensils when we were seated). In addition we requested salt and ketchup - because at this point we had high hopes our food would be arriving soon and our table was not prepared with these items unlike the other tables near us.\n\nFinally over an hour after being seated our food arrived with unmelted cheese on the eggs and 2 packets of ketchup for our table of 3. When the waitress walked away we took the bottle of ketchup from an empty table nearby and ate our breakfast. \n\nThis was a disappointing visit to say the least. I recommend you do not visit this establishment under any circumstances.",

I walked into the restaurant and not only was my order not ready, but everyone who ordered at the counter getting their meal before mine, and they were getting it for half price. \n\nI watched 9 people come in, order, and get their food before me, but pay half what I did because I ordered online. I sat there for 45 minutes despite the fact that I ordered ahead of everyone else there, paid double what they did for their food, and was confirmed that the order was ready.\n\nI was apologized to frequently for the wait, but at no point was I offered any explanation as to why I waited 9 times longer than those ordering at the counter, or why they told grubhub it was ready, or why it was charged at twice the price as at the counter (delivered I would understand, but I picked it up). \n\nI live a block and a half away (315 N Senate). I had hoped it would be a place that I could carry out from often, but I was thoroughly disappointed. All said, the food was OK, but the experience was absolutely horrible. Due to that experience I would recommend either Bento Asian (mostly Japanese, $2.50 delivery) or the China King at 148 N Deleware (free delivery) for Asian delivery or carry-out. DO NOT ORDER HERE FROM GRUBHUB OR ANY OTHER CARYOUT/DELIVERY APP/SITE.",

The roast pork sandwich is listed as $7.00, fine, but any sandwich-eater worth their salt (or pepper) knows that a sandwich isn't complete without some toppings, and George's sticks it to you ever-so-casually: \"Anything on that?\" Unsuspecting customers will be charged on top of the $7 for what should be basic, included toppings. This would be acceptable if the sandwich had any semblance of decency, yet it is completely revolting from first glance to last choked bite.The bread was completely soggy and drenched in oil that was hot enough to burn my hand. The pork was entirely flavorless, the provolone and broccoli rabe couldn't even save it. I regret wasting my appetite on this disgrace of a sandwich. Do yourself a favor and go down the street to Paesano's instead.",

    "text": "This is the worst delivery experience I've ever had. I was a delivery driver for another Domino's for 5 years during college, so I know that things can get hectic, but this was ridiculous. Ordered online at 11:00pm, tracker said it would be delivered in 25-35 minutes. At 12:00am, the pizza had still not arrived so I called the store. They said mine was the next one out the door and should be there in a few minutes, because I live about 1 mile away from the store. At 1:00am, still no pizza. I call again and they said the driver left with my order and another order 30 minutes ago, and instead of driving to my house first, which was 1 MILE AWAY, he went to the other house first which was further away, and gave them their pizza AND MY PIZZA. They offered to make a new one and send it out, but I didn't want to wait up until 3 in the morning, so I said no thanks. They offered a free pizza on my next order, but that doesn't do anything to help me right now because it too late to order from anywhere else. This is why Uber Eats and other forms of food delivery will end up crushing stores like this. So to whoever runs this store, seriously, congratulations. You've just won the award for worst store in the franchise.",

I had to get the manager to get served. \nThe hibachi chef was one of the least skilled that I have ever seen.  One in our party ordered filet mignon.  He cooked all the dinners at our table, then after he served everyone realized that he hadn't cooked the filet, cooked it and gave it to the wrong person.  My friend didn't realize the mistake.  However, my wife pointed it out to me after we left.  Let me also mention that the place looks very worn and unkempt.  needless to say we will not be back.

Salad on one plate had more dressing then salad, really inedible. What I did notice was the complete lack of bacon or sausage or anything pork related. Odd for a brunch, but maybe gypsies don't eat meat?\nThe other thing I found was 1. It was 40 degrees in the bathroom, really really cold. 2. The wall next to our table really needed painting, or at least washing, food splatters and grease stains on the paint were really unappealing. The cute puffy wall coverings looked like someone used them as napkins over and over.  A tremendous disappointment after many really great experiences at Southern Cross. \nIt seems to me they can do a lot better, or close the place for a rehab. \nWe felt pretty ripped off with brunch, though the live music was awesome. Maybe dinner is better, breakfast is really hard to do well after all but I doubt we will ever find out as we have no intention of returning.

There were 4 of us: 1 only ate the meatballs, as the pasta had pizza sauce on them and were cold, 2nd ate 5 bites of his clam (canned) linguini because there was 3/4 cup of olive oil at the bottom of the bowl and no garlic or seasoning, 3rd, mine was over cooked chicken parm, eggplant parm was dry and over cooked and the ravioli were over salted...pizza sauce and melted cheese over the top. The service was bad and no compensation for any of it. AND it took 1 Hour to get served.",

    "text": "I came here with my family today with total of 5 people.  Service was decent and food was okay. When the bill came I noticed there was 18% gratuity already added to the bill. I questioned the server where this automatic gratuity info was posted since it was no where to be found inside the restaurant or on the menu. \n She told me the gratuity info was posted on their website.  I told her people don't go on to the website to look for this info and I felt cheated.  After I left I went to their website and looked for the info, well it was no where to be found!  I called back and asked her to direct me to this info on their website and she then says it's posted on Yelp!  I told her  Yelp is not your website and I am going to call my credit card company for dishonest business practice.\nShe said if you come back now I will refund your tip, I told her I already left and can't and will not turn around.  She said well then we can't do any refund.  After going back and forth, another lady came to the phone and I told her I will give my cc number and she will run the refund.  \nLook on Yelp and there is no info on the gratuity!  What a dishonest restaurant!\nI normally tip at least 15% and I just do not appreciate this kind no of practice!  When did it become automatically adding 18% for 5 or more?  Isn't the norm for party of 8?",

IT TOOK 15 minutes to make TWO DRINKS IN AN EMPTY SHOP.   The guy who sat there and stared at me as we waited never made one attempt to make my drink after I tipped 20% on the order.  Two coffees, $12.50 , 15 minute wait, empty shop.  Do the math.  This isn't the first time it has happened, staff is usually unfriendly.  I was coming in everyday and buying coffee but I got sick of spending my money with people who act like jerks.  I wrote an email to the shop and they never responded which is 100% proof they don't give a damn about bad service.  AS MUCH AS I LOVE COFFEE SHOPS I WILL NEVER RETURN TO THIS PLACE.",

He kept the soda refills coming, and did a good job overall. However, this is where the praise ends.\n\nI went to this restaurant because I was in the area and wanted some Italian food. I saw the four star average reviews and figured it would be tasty. Be warned. It is WAY overpriced, and the food wasn't even good. The mozzarella sticks looked and tasted like the frozen ones you buy at the grocery store. They were $7.99 for five small sticks. Not worth it. Then came the entrees. Everything on the menu had cute names and sounded delicious. My husband ordered Chicken Parm, and I had the Baked Ziti. It was awful. I mean... not good at all. His chicken was \"ok,\" but not crispy on the outside like parm should be. Mine didn't have the brown, bubbly, cheesy top you'd normally see on baked ziti. The mozzarella cheese was barely even melted. The sauce tasted like it came from a jar. It was weak and not very flavorful. I had about five bites and didn't even take my leftovers home for the kids. \n\nSave your money and go to Olive Garden instead. I like to support local businesses, but this was an unpleasant dining experience. Let me say again, it was ridiculously expensive and the food was just BAD. I seriously left there wishing I'd gone to McDonald's instead.",

    "text": "Stay away. My husband and I stopped here this afternoon to use a gift card given to us a long time ago. We do not normally buy cold stone ice cream, and we're pretty easy to please. All we were looking for was a nice cold treat on a hot day- what we got was a small ice cream that was way too sweet (yes, even for ice cream!), and a chocolate shake that was not good, for about $11. My husband took one sip of his shake and pushed it away. I took a taste and agreed that something was not right. It had a distinctly sour, bitter aftertaste. While I finished my ice cream, he debated about whether he wanted something else instead. Since the ingredients seemed to be the problem, he decided did not want something else, even though my ice cream seemed fine. When I took the shake back to the register and explained the problem, we were told we could not receive a refund, only a replacement. Both of us had an upset stomach for about two hours afterwards, and neither of us had more than a sip or two. Poor customer service, bad ingredients. Food poisoning is not worth $11, so we simply left.\n\nPoor customer service is my biggest pet peeve- as someone who has worked in customer service and international sales for four years, I promise you- it's really not THAT difficult of a task to make sure your customer is happy, even if there is a language/geographical barrier (today, there was neither). While I realize that the employee I spoke to is probably a minimum wage high school student, store policies that young woman has to follow are set by real adults. Whoever set the policies for this store clearly is not doing their job!\n\nShame on you, coldstone, for trying to give my (active-duty & a veteran) husband food poisoning on Memorial Day, and refusing to make any real attempt to make amends. Don't worry, you sure as hell won't see us again, ever. Fool me once....",

When I called to complain the manager was unapologetic and only offered a refund if I was willing to \"take the food back\" when I was already across town.

It took me three phone calls and two messages which were never returned to even get a reservation. I did inform them that I had a groupon in all messages and conversations. We arrived a few minutes prior to our reservation time and I gave them the groupon as instructed per groupon policy. We were promptly seated but no on came to greet us, take our orders for tea or even just a nod and \"I'll be with you soon\" for over ten minutes. Eventually someone did take our orders and bring out our rasberry sage tea which was \"okay\" but nothing spectacular. My mother's salad and my soup arrived....only my soup had been sloshed all over the small bowl and was running down the side into the paper doily and all over the serving plate. At a tea house, you expect the best service, atmosphere, presentation, etc. and this place and/or staff didn't deliver. Furthermore, my she-crab soup was very watery and really lacked any flavor. The rest of our \"tea\" was \"okay\" but again, nothing special or fabulous in taste or presentation. I do a better job when I entertain in my home with taste and attention to detail. I was trying not to make negative comments as it was my mother's birthday but the real insult came when the bill was presented and I noticed they added an automatic %18 gratuity.......for two people????? I would have tipped well anyway, even though it was not earned, as my son works in the service industry and I typically tip 20%. I wanted to say something but again, I was trying to keep the mood happy for my mom and it wasn't about the money but rather their attitude and greediness. Not sure if they had an issue with groupons or are they just this mediocre and entitled in general with their customers??? Overall, not a great experience and don't think I will ever return.",

The spring roll was doughy with limp(not crisp) veggies and bland.  The duck abalone soup was the only part of the meal that had some slight flavor. My companions had the duck with vegetables over rice which looked very dry, and the vegetables had a burned oily flavor.  Another had the pork over  rice which was salty but otherwise underseasoned as well.   We waited about 15-20 minutes before our order was taken,  and the wait for the check was long as well.

Not a single smile to be had.  I don't expect my behind kissed, or even small talk, but I don't expect to give business to an establishment that hires people who seem bothered to be there.  There are three tables inside with ample room for a few more---not very family friendly.  Me, hubs and three children under 3 waited patiently for a table.  The icing on the cake was other customers---a lady practically climbed over my daughter to grab my hubs' seat when he got up to use the bathroom.  Seriously.  Not the establishment's fault, but all around poor attitude and rudeness abounded.  We won't be returning.  If you have children, pass on this place and enjoy ice cream at home.",

    "text": "Seriously the worst food I've had in a long time. I stopped coming to red lobster... due to the fact you can go to ANY steak & seafood restaurant... and they will charge you the same price for FRESH DELICIOUS FOOD!   This was just sad!!!! Our bill was 110$ for 2 people and it was horrible.    I didn't order broccoli... but the servers had a large birthday party... so I really felt like they just rushed when with us.  I hate broccoli. When she brought out the food which was steak Nd a lobster tail.. she brought out my medium well steak that was cooked all the way thru. It was dry and flavorless.  And the lobster tail was tough, dry and just gross.   I asked her for some ranch , butter; and lemon. So I could drown my food. Considering it was near closing I didn't want to ask for anything to be remade... however they could have offered us something off the bill.    By the time she came back with the sauce I asked for at least 10 mins had passed. My lobster was cold to the touch.  Oh on top of they didn't serve my mash potatoes until 10 mins after my entree. For 10 mins my dry food sat on the table and got cold because it was disgusting and dry!       It was still nasty after I drown it in sauce. All I ate was the rice(that I had to ask for after she brought out the dry old looking broccoli) and the mash potatoes. Which we paid more for lobster Mac but was brought out the smallest portion I've ever seen.    I've ordered it before and never gotten a portion this Small.     I'm also PRETTY POSITIVE Our meal came with a salad. Matter fact I KNOW. Because we've ordered the same thing before. They never even brought us OUR SALAD!      Seriously i will never step foot in this place AGAIN! Ohh and Everytime I come in here either the manager is arguing with employees. Or a customer is arguing with the wait staff for their bad service.",

The polenta wasn't the best I've had, the cheese empanadas were not empanadas but rather fried little puff balls (and if they're going to be vegetarian, there should more more, not less of the meat ones), the cauliflower was pretty good but again, not worth the price. \n\nBut let me tell you about our service! First the server brought out the wrong wine for my sisters (they got a red cab Mendoza, a white Chardonnay was delivered). Nobody really checked on us except to ask if we wanted to order more food. Then! One of my sisters PULLED A REALLY LONG HAIR OUT OF HER MOUTH AFTER TAKING A BITE OF FOOD!!!!!!!! When we alerted our server, his response was, \"ew, I'll be sure to tell the chef.\"\n\nNEVER did we get an apology, nor was the item replaced nor taken off the check!!!!! And on top of that, he charged us for the red AND the white wine!!!!! The sister who had the hair is super polite and it was impressive that she even alerted him of the hair, so unfortunately she did not fight to have the item taken off, regardless of my urging her to do so. Alas, I decided to share this review. That hair was LONG AND NASTY! \n\nNo way will I return. What a shame.",

    "text": "First off if there was a lesser rating I could give it I would. Never in my whole entire life have I ever been to a place that handled a situation so horribly. So a group of us went in for Valentine's Day, we had a reservation for 8 and were sat by 845, no big deal we were just a bit cranky and hungry. The host was very nice and was trying her best. \n We finally get sat and get drinks ordered and Our appetizers. It's going well, our server was nice and we were happy. Now this is where it goes down hill. Our appetizers come out about 5-10 mins apart. We brushed it off. A party that got sat after us were now getting their entrees? We start getting irritable at this time we've been in the restaurant for 2 hours. We finally start getting out entrees. 5 people are missing theirs. Sever comes over tells our friend their out of what she wanted. Would've been nice to know before everyone stared receiving their food. But she got to pick whatever she wanted for free, not bad. Everyone is now done with their meals and My friend beside me never got her food. By this time the restaurant is basically empty. The manager comes over and just goes \" what did you have\" my friend told her then she just walked away. No apology. Nothing. Her food finally comes out and she asks our sever why was she just now receiving her food? He replies with \"oh you know the kitchen gets slammed, things happen\" our jaws nearly hit the floor. Granted they comped her meal. But everything was poorly executed and the manager never stopped by to apologize, our server never apologized. \n  I guessed they assumed that they were gonna go down in flames cause they thought passing out a $5 off coupon for next time would do anything. Safe to say we spent 3 hours in a restaurant for a lousy experience. The food was decent but not worth it. Like the saying goes \" you can fix lousy food with great service but you can't fix lousy service with great food\" and we don't ever, ever plan on coming back here. I get that it was Valentine's Day and it was busy, completely understood but it's the mangers job to smooth over the situation. Comping the food is great but that doesn't fix anything. Get it together macaroni grill.",

    "text": "Gaetano's used to be one of the better spots in the area (not saying much) to grab a good quick lunch. I'd stop in here roughly once a week to grab a sandwich off of their lunch special menu that rotated daily.\n\nWell they completely ruined that. Gone is the rotating, reasonably priced lunch menu. They've since replaced it with a menu that isn't even worth ordering off of. They regularly had specials of sandwiches, wraps, and salads on the lunch menu for under $7 that came with chips/fries and a drink. All but one item on the menu includes a drink now and I just paid $9.01 for a buffalo chicken wrap, tiny bag of chips, and soda I had to buy separately. Whoever made it must have missed the memo on how to assemble it because it didn't have the crisp lettuce and tomato inside of mine that was stated on the menu. I got a $9 wheat wrap stuffed with a pathetic amount of chicken and nothing else. It was smaller than the premade Wawa wraps. Huge change in what Gaetano's used to be, their portion sizes were always their strong point.\n\nI posted a picture a while ago of a meatball sandwich lunch special I got before they started cheaping out on their offerings. I wish I took a picture of my pathetic wrap today, they couldn't look more different. I didn't have time however because it took about 12 minutes to come out and some of us don't have all day.\n\nI'll be looking elsewhere during my lunch break.",

I had eaten a perfectly acceptible brunch at the original location in Baton Rouge and still had very low expectations...they were not met.\n     The good first: the service was friendfly and efficient.\n     The bad: poor quality chips, including some tasting of rancid oil, were accompanied with pretty good salsa and truly tasteless queso. Seriously, the jar of queso in the grocey is eons better.\n     My lenten crawfish quesedillas were okay, but nothing to write home about and they were probably the tastiest thing to hit our table.\n     My lovely wife had the not at all lovely (to look at...an amalgam of beiges & light browns in amoebic puddles) Rio Grande plate. Bear in mind, Paige is pretty down with standard American-style mexican if it is fresh, but she was pretty underwhelmed.\n     The crowd was mostly tourists (from out of town or Metairie/Slidell, etc from the looks of it) so perhaps the lovely setting helped them ignore the pallid dreck proffered here, but its walking distance location will in no way seduce into another visit.",

    "text": "So incredibly disappointed in this restaurant.  We were so excited to try this new location of Herbie's and it did not live up to expectations.  The food was not to the quality of the prices that they charged on the menu.  The hostess sat us and the older manager was visibly not happy with where we were seated in the restaurant.  The french onion soup lacked flavor and could have used salt and pepper.  It lacked the beefy/wine flavoring that a good french onion soup should have in it.  The Beef Wellington, although beautifully presented was disappointing.  It lacked flavor and had no seasoning in it.  The Mushrooms/spinach/red pepper medley that it was paired with had CANNED red peppers in it. Seriously, a $25.00+plus dish with canned/jarred red peppers? It was like baby food.  The Flank steak had no seasoning to it and the sauce that it was served with it also lacked flavor and tasted like Mayo.  The chicken with shaved brussels sprouts salad was underwhelming.  The \"1/2 chicken\" was the size of a cornish hen. The server sold us on their \"amazing\" red velvet donuts for dessert.  That was a mistake. The donuts were hard and not warm, the \"white chocolate\" icing was hard as well and there was stale broken up donuts sprinkled around the plate with the chocolate.  The coffee was also luke warm.  We will not be back.\n\nHerbie's needs to revisit their seasoning in the kitchen STAT and rework their menu.",

We started wondering if Ted Peter's is associated with that place Dicks Last Resort where the staff is intentionally miserable.  While there was one server who was friendly (taller blond with a braided ponytail), the rest of the staff were simply unhappy people.  The majority of the time we were there they moped around behind the counter like zombies where a TV was on with the news.  Smiles were met with grumpy faces, waves from a smiling 17 month old were met with a obvious turn the other way, questions were met with short and unpleasant answers - it was depressing to say the least.  To say it nicely, the staff all need some hugs- as someone previously mentioned about Carl (again except for the blond with braided ponytail, she was pleasant). If you are looking to bring out of town guests to Ted Peter's, I don't recommend it. If the experience was like ours tonight, your guests will certainly leave with the wrong impression of the people of St. Pete.",

Their walk-in hut offers beer only, no place inside to sit and relax. The outdoor BBQ sandwiches feed the crowd as they stare at the road to see who arrives next. The band was good, but were crammed into a corner of the dirt, near the beer hut with no dance floor.The only place of solace is the Tavern itself, and a charming respite from the outside.
