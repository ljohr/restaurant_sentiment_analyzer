We have done this on several occasions, and the kids love that they each get their own personal pizza, made the way they like.   They both ordered their pizza with 2 items and wanted BBQ sauce as the base instead of tomato sauce.  (this is the only way they enjoy pizza).   I was told that they could only get tomato sauce, not BBQ sauce.   I explained that we have gotten it this way several times before.   We were told that they don't offer it this way any more.   I see that some of the pizzas offer BBQ sauce and pointed it out, but again was told that it couldn't be made this way for them.   I asked if I could pay additional to have it made with BBQ sauce, but once again told it was not possible.   Sadly, we left the restaurant and chose a different nearby restaurant for lunch.  I'm sorry to say I won't be able to take the kids here anymore.",

I have been to this IHOP on 4 separate occasions and every single time there has been something wrong with my order. IT WAS ALWAYS WRONG, EVERY TIME. The international house of pancakes shouldn't be screwing up pancakes. When I order sausage they give me bacon. When I order chocolate chip pancakes they give me blueberry. Missing eggs and hash browns, I could go on....I can't tell if its a language barrier or laziness but this location has screwed up both my dine-in and take-out orders literally every time I have given them a try. How many times can one apologize for incompetence? That location is mostly for the guest at the adjoining hotel, locals know better. I won't be going back. The location a few miles down on veterans is much much better.",

Our lunch order took nearly an hour and 20 minutes to deliver and we are only 1.5 miles away, also there was no soy sauce, ginger, utensils or anything with the order which is weird for Sushi place.  While they were apologetic about the long deliver time but decent food with bad service doesn't make me want to go back there again. If they offer delivery it should be reliable fast and include the sides that you would expect from a sushi place. \n\nNot a place I would recommend ordering from if you have a busy schedule.",

I saw Baklava, and was told not to purchase them by the sales associate (and I appreciate her honesty) because they were hard as a rock..

The chocolate was ok, but the mousse has a horrible RANK taste, and SMELL as well.  It tasted and smelled  like spoiled cream cheese.  It wasn't one of those things that taste like something, IT WAS SPOILED.  Even the partial peanut butter cups on the top tasted stale!!!\n\nThe pound cake was ok, nothing special..

    "text": "Well, to start the dining area is very very dark. We sat at the sushi bar and our table was dirty and sticky. Next we ordered. I got a spicy tuna hand roll and as I look over to the chef who is making our sushi, I see him scooping the spicy tuna with his bare hands and packing it into the seaweed wrap. Then I see him walk over to the microwave oven, touch that with his bare hands, touch dirty menus with his bare hands, and then go back to my spicy tuna roll and continue to scoop it and pack it with his bare hands ! I couldn't eat it after it was served to me. Since I was starving ordered another roll and ate that, but BAD IDEA. I immediately became dizzy and nauseous. I drank lots of water and decided that maybe I could walk it off. We left and continued to walk around downtown santa barbara and no longer than 20 minutes after we left my stomach started to grumble and I felt faint. After running around frantically looking for a restroom I finally found one and puked up all the sushi that I ate. I would not reccomend eating here until it is inspected..",

    "text": "The beer selection really is fabulous, but with Drafting Room up the road and Victory a few miles away, you have to have good food and equally good service to win over those competitors. \nAfter several visits, today was easily the most appalling service out family has ever received from any establishment, ever! From the level of irritation of us walking in as the staff was just setting up (we walked in at 10:45am, the restaurant opens at 10:30am as posted on the website), for brunch, to the series of unreal circumstances that took place over the next hour, I am still in a state of shock. We were ignored for the first ten minutes, despite my asking if we had somehow arrived \"too early\" and getting a simple \"you're fine\" in response, no eye contact, and no attempt to counter the whispering in each other's ears and rolling their eyes at us. \nFast forward to the meal, we received our appetizers of tater tots and then our waitress, Katie, went back to drinking beer at the bar with the other servers while we sat in search of ketchup. I finally got up and went to the bar to ask the gentleman bartender for ketchup. Katie then retrieved two sides of ketchup for us. When I said thank you, her response was \"sure\". (Also, I can look past the blond hair that was inside our tots but it was adding insult to injury at this point.)\nOur breakfast came, the food was indeed good but the service was soooo bad. My two boys eventually went to sit on the leather couch and play together, clearly disturbing the on-shift wait staff eating at the bar and chatting. When my boys walked back to the table they were saturated with the smell of body odor from the couch. I mentioned to one of the male members of the wait staff, that the leather sofa smelled and that they might want to wipe them down when the day was through. He said \"oh, really, I can't tell, my sense of smell isn't all that good\" and then \"we'll make Katie take care of it\" as he walked over to Katie and another female to openly mock me for making a comment on the couch. All of this in front of my children, the oldest of which was completely confused by why his mom was being made fun of. Not the example we set for our children. \nWe will never, ever, ever be back to WOB Exton and I will recommend skipping this establishment to every person who will listen.",

No one smiled at us, and we were completely ignored throughout our stay.  We had 3 different people serving us, so we had no idea who our waitress was.  No one explained to us that the only option at ZEN was all you can eat, so when we ordered only 4 small items and received a bill for $56.00, we were astonished.  The waitresses simply \"dumped\" the food to our table....No smiles, no asking who the food was for.  I had to get up from our table to ask for our bill, as we were completely ignored and sat there forever waiting for someone to serve us.  I ended up complaining to one of the waitresses who laughed throughout the few minutes I complained.  DO NOT go to this restaurant....Overall a HORRIBLE experience!!!",

    "text": "I dont leave reviews but had to as my experience tonight left a really sour taste in my mouth.\n\nWalked in the restaurant to place a take out order for two pho dishes. Paid by card & left a 4$ tip on a 22$ takeout order. \n\nAs they gave me the food i asked if i could have hot sauce as well and was told by the young man that thats 1$ extra... i had no cash only card but i was surprised because i was just there yesterday cus my bf is sick and picked up an order with the hot sauce without having to pay anything for it. The older man yesterday was super friendly to me and said if i ever need sauce to just ask so i was baffled that now i had to pay for it. Additionally this is the same sauce that is sitting on the table. I didn't ask for extra sauce! I let the young man know that if he wanted to charge me a $1 to go ahead but i had gotten it for free before to which he replied the rules have changed. And when i said that was yesterday he mumbled and walked away and begrudgingly filled a container for me and as he handed it said next time its a 1$... \n\nWhy do i have to pay extra to get the same sauce sitting on the table which i got for free the other day. Secondly i tipped u $4 on takeout. Ive worked in the business. People rarely tip for pickup so you still have the nerve to be a dick... I walked away with the food pissed off that this really just happened. and he had the nerve to yell nothing is free as i was walking away. All this commotion occurred with customers in the store.  Great customer service! \n\nOh and when i get home only one bag of toppings was provided for two orders, with only 1 lime wedge to be shared by two people... \n\nSucks as this is the only pho place around and i finally grew to like their pho. Refuse to go back and give my money to that little twerp.",

I loved the tempura style batter, but the calamari was VERY tough and chewy.  We paid for it anyway since we had eaten more than just a bite.  The sizzling rice soup and the house (combo) fried rice were both too salty to eat - it tasted like they dumped the whole shaker in.  My entree was the Mongolian beef, and the beef was so soft and without texture I could barely chew it.  Disgusting.

    "text": "Just the facts: the front desk was kind and friendly. We wrote our party's shoe sizes on the appropriate slip and received our footware. A few pairs were the wrong size (3 of 8), but it was easy enough to resolve. After getting settled at our lane, we ordered a few drinks. After receiving our drinks, the waitress (named Leah E., according to our receipt) never came back to us. We waited for roughly 30 minutes for her to come to us but never did. For approximately 20 minutes after that, we waited for her to come into our vicinity and tried to flag her down, but it took a few tries before she saw us. Please know that while the lanes on either side of us also had parties, half of the lanes were unused, the bar was not full, and the tables were empty. It was a Sunday evening at about 8:30 or 9. Once the food was delivered, we never saw our server again. Please don't misconstrue my statement as hyperbole...I didn't just not see the server at our table, I didn't see her at any table. She didn't check on the two neighboring parties, but we did see her behind the bar a few times. She was not the only server on staff, as others were seen serving other lanes and, as established previously, the place was not busting at the seams. The food order was wrong, the drink order was improperly charged, we had to go to the bar for silverware. We did go to the bar for drinks due to her absence, and the bar service was pleasant but slow. When the check came and we attempted to fix a mistake on the check (we ordered a single slider burger but were charged for a plate. When we brought it to her attention, she said not to worry about it. We asked if we would be charged for just a slider (aka the thing we ordered) or if we'd be charged the plate meal (what we got). She replied that we would be charged the single slider. When the check came, we were charged the meal. She changed it without complaint. However, someone in our group ordered two wells vodkas and she charged Ketel One to the ticket both times due to a misunderstanding. She was less happy and less willing to understand or resolve this issue, resorting to having another server bring the final ticket, run our card, and bid us farewell. She did not make eye contact after his point (even after a member from our group returned to the table to retrieve a jacket). She did not apologize for mix ups, misunderstandings, or wait times, and she did not thank us for our business or wish us good night.To top it all off: while I think waitstaff have the right to whatever emotions and experiences they will on a given shift, our server was not the most cheerful person. It could be that she had a bad night (God knows we all have em). But after seeing all of the other bad reviews, I felt it might benefit the community to add to the menagerie of disenchanted customers' reviews. As an organizational psychologist, a patron, and Louisiana resident, I wish the alley would work on resolving the issues in their customer service.",

They put us by the open door even though we asked to be inside because it was chilly out.  Waited 15 minutes before our waitress even came around. We should have walked out then, but we thought the food would make up for it. Wrong!  This waitress kept having her table's food and drinks being returned for being wrong.  She couldn't get anything right.  My friend and I ordered the try 3, which comes out of pots and placed in bowls, so we should have been served quickly. No, we waited an hour.  Every time I saw the waitress, which wasn't often, she said it was on it's way out. When it did come out, the jambalaya was cold and the crawfish etoffee was lukewarm and the gumbo had no meat in it. What a waste of our time. Tourist trap I'm sure because it's on Canal, so stay away.",

First problem was we found hair in our food and it turns out to be one of the rude supervisors and refused to even help us out and denied us our money back so the general manager who was awesome helped us out and refunded us. Then all of a sudden tonight after months of not going back to this we decided to and we specifically asked for our nacho cheese that's comes on the burrito to just put it on the side like all the other t bells do we never got charged for it and my boyfriend is deathly allergic to it and for a soft taco instead of hard shell. Of course it was all wrong cheese everywhere charged for the nacho cheese no soft taco and the young lady who took our order tried to argue with us saying \"you didn't say that\" last time I checked the customer is always right. Working in the food industry i know good service when i see it and she didnt have any of it. Her voice, attitude, body language all wrong. The manager at the time accommodated us. He was polite and so nice. But the young employee however was horrible and shouldn't be even interacting with people. Pathetic attitude, laughing as she got our order wrong and horrible service all around and nothing done about it no apology...nothing. This taco bell just needs new employees and people who actually pay attention to what's going on instead of goofing off.",

    "text": "Gaetano's used to be one of the better spots in the area (not saying much) to grab a good quick lunch. I'd stop in here roughly once a week to grab a sandwich off of their lunch special menu that rotated daily.\n\nWell they completely ruined that. Gone is the rotating, reasonably priced lunch menu. They've since replaced it with a menu that isn't even worth ordering off of. They regularly had specials of sandwiches, wraps, and salads on the lunch menu for under $7 that came with chips/fries and a drink. All but one item on the menu includes a drink now and I just paid $9.01 for a buffalo chicken wrap, tiny bag of chips, and soda I had to buy separately. Whoever made it must have missed the memo on how to assemble it because it didn't have the crisp lettuce and tomato inside of mine that was stated on the menu. I got a $9 wheat wrap stuffed with a pathetic amount of chicken and nothing else. It was smaller than the premade Wawa wraps. Huge change in what Gaetano's used to be, their portion sizes were always their strong point.\n\nI posted a picture a while ago of a meatball sandwich lunch special I got before they started cheaping out on their offerings. I wish I took a picture of my pathetic wrap today, they couldn't look more different. I didn't have time however because it took about 12 minutes to come out and some of us don't have all day.\n\nI'll be looking elsewhere during my lunch break.",

The string beans were fried in stale tasting oil and the boss won't admit it had a bad taste to it. The walnut sprimp that we ordered were fried in extra thick batter. the small sprimp turned into a fat corn dog looking thing. Our last dish, orange beef was also covered in thick breading, beef was not tender, hard to chew and it had crazy amount of glaze glob on it. Horrible Horrible...I was super disappointed after wanting to visit there for a while. Dont waste your money. This is not how Chinese food should taste like!",

    "text": "Stopped by the drive thru which moved much slower than what's reasonable, then picked up my 7 piece meal. Was in a bit of a hurry so trusted them to fulfill the order for what I paid for, should have know better. How in the world can they sack up and order that has items that are standard with every order I have no idea. To make matters worse, I called since the distance we live it's not practical just to jump in the car and go back for the items they screwed up on. No one would answer the phone for several minutes. After multiple attempts, a girl finally answered. When I asked to speak with a Manager, she just hesitated and said ok. Then she literally put the phone down, and I could hear their conversation, none of which involved needing a Mgr on the phone. Hung up after a few mins, only to call and call to listen to a busy signal. The food itself was ok, chicken seemed like it had been cooked for awhile and the amount of wasted extra skin made small pieces look huge. Clearly this location has lost it's way but I even filled out a customer survey on the receipt asking to speak with a Mgr or GM, even the owner. Never even heard from a line cook so Churchs as a whole must have no regard for customer service. Why even have a survey on the receipt? If they had just answered the dang phone that day and addressed the situation I would have possibly returned to get my items they shorted me and it would have been over. Why would I, or anyone, want to give them another chance after such abysmal service.",

We asked to sit a table over just for a little privacy and he said no he's sitting at that table .. Well okay then . When he asked us what we want to drink I order a coke and without another word he brings us Pepsi . I don't know if it's just me but there is a difference and if I knew they had Pepsi products I would have simply ordered something else . The food wasn't very good for the price . I can get a frozen burger at mcdonalds if that's what I was in the mood for. After the obvious mood change the owner walked us to out table and TOSSES a coupon for 15% off and walks away without a word . We were not checked up on throughout and I had an empty cup through most of my meal . Won't be returning .",

Onion rings extra crispy were good dipped in the fry sauce.  Half our order was messed up somehow which the manager attributed to the computer screens messing up. ??  What was most disturbing though was how filthy the place was. The tables were all greasy and had clearly been \"cleaned\" with greasy rags. The floor was dirty and very sticky. It was disturbing to see that the floor was being \"mopped\" with a Swiffer, and food on the floor was just pushed to the side.  I really wanted some custard because the taste we had been given was really good, but after watching the water on the dripping rag being slopped all over the machine we decided not to.",

When we were done, we had separate checks. One friend tipped 10% for it and had a female server chased us down outside and COMMANDED (exact words: \"COME HERE!\" with a frown on her face) my friend to come back inside and QUESTIONED her with rudeness why she didn't tip 15%. My friend who used to work at a country club didn't even bother to explain to her what is actual serving. By this time, I was truly regretful for tipping at all. Don't get me wrong, the food is not bad, but not worth the service that we had. We would never visit this place again.",

The problem was the kitchen, obviously, when the food came it was dry and overdone, the sides came later, the desert was not cooked(rice pudding).  The waitress did offer another choice and we will see how that is later as after being there over 1 hr we brought home.  The owners or managers only seem to care if a substitute was made and who was your server but not that the kitchen staff is being overworked with this crowd and cannot be attentive to their cooking when being pushed like this.  The first manager pushed me to second manager and they really don't seem to care as long as they can push the crowd to fill the tables.  A few waitresses heard my complaints and thanked me as they said they have been trying to tell them this too.

    "text": "I came here with my family today with total of 5 people.  Service was decent and food was okay. When the bill came I noticed there was 18% gratuity already added to the bill. I questioned the server where this automatic gratuity info was posted since it was no where to be found inside the restaurant or on the menu. \n She told me the gratuity info was posted on their website.  I told her people don't go on to the website to look for this info and I felt cheated.  After I left I went to their website and looked for the info, well it was no where to be found!  I called back and asked her to direct me to this info on their website and she then says it's posted on Yelp!  I told her  Yelp is not your website and I am going to call my credit card company for dishonest business practice.\nShe said if you come back now I will refund your tip, I told her I already left and can't and will not turn around.  She said well then we can't do any refund.  After going back and forth, another lady came to the phone and I told her I will give my cc number and she will run the refund.  \nLook on Yelp and there is no info on the gratuity!  What a dishonest restaurant!\nI normally tip at least 15% and I just do not appreciate this kind no of practice!  When did it become automatically adding 18% for 5 or more?  Isn't the norm for party of 8?",

For example, There is nothing like salad chat or a tandoori tikka chat in india. So if you are looking to eat real Indian chat, than I would not go there. I don't know how the place got all the positive reviews, maybe some free food for reviews, who knows. But this review is coming from an Indian who loves Indian food and has explored many Indian restaurant serving Chat across the country. I know it's a bit harsh, but the goal is to give  honest review of the food, without being rude. I hope it helps!!",

We were forgotten and then after finding a manager we were left again to wait for another hour before receiving our food. At this point we were late for the baseball game and wanted to leave. After receiving our food we found the meats overcooked and hardly saw our waitress. If you are looking for a slow place to wait for your food and you have no where to go this would be it.

Although it was 10 pm on a Wednesday night, she was hesitant about sitting a party of two at a large table. Perhaps she was expecting a sudden stream of late night diners. The waitress was as sloppy and disheveled as the hostess. No makeup, no hairstyle and clothes that looked as though she found them on the street. I ordered something from the menu that did not have goat cheese listed as one of its ingredients, but she argued with me that the menu did have it listed. I showed her the menu and corrected her. She was rude and had a nasty attitude. I guess I would too if I looked like her. It was $30 for a burger, a salad and two Diet Cokes.The staff is arrogant, the place is filthy and the food is perfect for those who don't care about their health or appearance and like to stuff their faces with a bunch of high fat, high cholesterol, high calorie greasy food.

The current kitchen staff executes the current menu rather badly. Chipotle shrimp tacos were bland and missing ingredients promised on the menu. At breakfast at least the waiter (one he showed up at breakfast) was honest in admitting that the salmon was no longer house-smoked as the menu says. Respect your customers enough not to lie to them on an easily corrected paper menu. Corned beef hash was more like chili, swimming in a sea of greasy broth in a bowl.

I asked to keep the seat I was already at. He said we couldn't, so I told him to speak to whomever to get the approval. The guy came out and ask what's the problem. I said hey boss, your place is dead and we'd like to sit at the large couch area. He said they can't because that's for parties of 8. I said I understand, but there was no one in your store and if that big party ever came, we would move. Their answer: no we can't. \n\nI said no problem, packed my things and was ready to walk out. The guy asked are you really leaving? I said bro, no one is here. The place is dead. What do I have to do? Order a bottle? He said no again.. so.. went to a better spot! Saqqara Hookah bear broad across from City Diner! So much better staff! No young deutche bags trying to show how much more testosterone they have.\n\nSaqqara had great fast hookah service, really really great food and best part, was their service.

We reminded him that we still had not gotten part of one of our dishes - he assured us that would be taken care of immediately. During this time our original server could be seen openly having a confrontation with multiple people and was subsequently removed from our service. A new server was appointed at which time we had to start over explaining the issues with the meal and still missing items.\nNeedless to say after nearly 2 hours we we just wanted to go! Part of meal was comped but will not go back!",

    "text": "We made reservations for New Years Eve and I have to say that we were both very disappointed. The food was mediocre at best and the service was subpar. For a $160 meal for two we should not have felt rushed.\nWe ordered antipasto which was pretty good however they didn't wait until we were done or close to being done before bringing out the clams casino which I have made better at home. \nFor my entree I ordered a veal dish with crab and scallops. This dish was $32 and the veal was tough and got a sprinkling of crab and 3 scallops. The sauce was awful so my boyfriend switched his meal for mine. He had orange roughy which was $20 something. It was just ok. For dessert we had tiramisu and coffee which would have been enjoyable if our waiter didn't decide to fill all the cheese containers right behind us and another kid spraying all the tables down with cleaning fluid. \nThis will be our last visit to Ralph's. I would advise the same to others unless you have extra cash just simply to burn.",

    "text": "I have been to The Blind Tiger on multiple occasions for everything from business meetings to pleasure like this morning. It has a great atmosphere inside and is in a convenient location. And after this mornings experience, along with multiple subpar visits, I had to write a review. The staff's attitude is always hit or miss on whether or not they are having a good day. I walked in this morning about 30 minutes after opening. It was quiet inside because it is an early Sunday morning. I said good morning to the girl who looked like she was mad at the world. Okay, we all have bad days and this wasn't the first time experiencing this there so I blew it off. I stated that I wanted my order to go and order two drinks. I asked about a pastry which was told it was a guava and cheese (one of my favorites) so I ordered one of those too. I sitting outside and walked back in after a few minutes to check on my order. I saw that the pastry was boxed up (which I appreciate the personal touch of their logo on the box) and then was told my first drink was ready. It wasn't in a to go cup so it had to be fixed. Instead of the barista handing it to me at the counter where I grabbed the pastry and was waiting, maybe three feet from the barista, she made me walk down to her to grab the cup instead of her walking to me. I walked back outside to wait on my second order, came back in a few minutes later to my next drink just being finished. I told the barista that the drink looked beautiful from the design she made on top and got zero response. And no have a good day, thank you, nothing. Instead the ladies were talking about what food they wanted to eat. Again, I was the only one who they were waiting on because it was a Sunday morning. I left and began drinking my coffee and it wasn't hot and my boyfriend's wasn't either, but it wasn't worth going back after all of that. And to top it all off, when I got home to eat the pastry, it didn't have any cheese in it and barely any guava and I threw part of it away. What blows my mind even more is that they hold training classes for those who want to learn more about coffee. They should focus more on making sure their staff is performing up to expectations as today they failed in almost every way possible.",

He insisted that meatball subs only get three meatballs and when I challenged him and inquired as to why that was he got very rude very quickly. As my sub was in the oven I decided to look up subway's website and, lo and behold, meatball subs DO get four meatballs, just like every other time I have gotten a sub from that store. When I informed him of this and asked for another meatball he stomped over, smashed two more meatballs into my sandwich, and snippily finished the order even after I informed him I didn't want to cause any trouble.\n\nThere are some wonderful people who work at this Subway. That guy was not one of them and the experience was enough to put me off that store completely. I'm not expecting five star service from a Subway but when you try to take advantage of your customers and then get angry when they call you out on it, maybe you aren't meant for a job that involves customer interaction.

Everything was still horrible and the microphones failed again! The bill they gave us had no prices next to the dishes. The only price we saw on the bill was a $180 smack in the middle. They said it was $150 minimum charge and they tacked on 20% tips to it when they did not deserve one penny. They could have told us the minimum charge at the beginning and tell us we should order more to reach $150, but they decided not to. They didn't say anything, they didn't allow us to get anything else too. They made us pay TWICE the amount we should have paid. They were so rude after we paid the bill. They literally rushed us right out of the room by shutting off the karaoke machine and pushing the chairs in. They promised us the room from 4:30 til 7:30, but kicked us out at 7:00 after we paid. The waitress who said 7:30 at the beginning was arguing with us when we asked her about it. She kept saying she knows what she said and that she said 7:00, but every single one of us knew she said 7:30 at the beginning. That was the end of the night.... Getting kicked out of a restaurant after getting charge twice the amount we ordered and arguing with the waitress for a half an hour of karaoke.",

I called to report the issue and Adam (who claimed that he was a manager) said that he would \"take care\" of my order next time.  He also asked me to take pictures of my pizzas (which I did).  The following week I called Pizza Guys to place my order.  Prior to placing my order, I informed the girl of my arrangement with Adam.  She responded with \"Hmmm... hold on and let me figure that out\".  Adam came to the phone and when I reminded him of our arrangement, he took my order (which was the exact same order as the one they messed up on), he told me that the total was $88!  When I reminded him again of our agreement, he then stated that he can \"discount my order significantly\" bringing it down to $60.  I told him that I was not satisfied with that.  If I had them correct the order the first time, I would not have paid for their error then, so why should I pay for it this time?  Adam told me that was the best he can do... even as a manager!  I asked who his boss was and he stated that she was standing right next to him.  I asked to speak with her. He placed me on hold for about five minutes only to return and say that she sent him back to the phone and tell me that the best she can do was to bring the cost down to $55. Come to find out that this was the OWNER! She did not even have the decency nor respect to come to the phone and talk to me.  Instead of trying to correct their error, they acted as if I was just trying to get some free food! I have NEVER been so insulted nor experienced such poor customer service!  I will NEVER order from this location EVER again!  I even spoke with Director of Operations regarding the issue and although he apologized and asked for another chance, I told him that I would not feel comfortable nor would I put it past that staff to put something in my food!  In my opinion, customer service is just as important as the quality of food I am purchasing.  Again - I will NEVER order from this location again, and if you think that customer service is just as important as I do, then you won't order from them either!",

The topic of Mardi Gras came up, and I was like oh I was just down in New Orleans for my birthday. I mentioned a few restaurants that I went to and L\u00fcke was one that I brought up. The guy asked me how did you like it because when I went  customer service was horrible. \n\nI was like wow, I thought it was just me! Which brings me to this review. My fiance and I went there for a late lunch. Once we were inside we were standing at the counter for about 5 minutes before three of the hostess even acknowledge that we were standing there. All three of the hostess were standing  talking and laughing as if they weren't at work.\n\nOnce we were finally seated and given the menu. We quickly realized the choices were very limited. I ordered the Shrimp and Grits and my fiance had the Gumbo. My food was adequate, it wasn't gross tasting but it wasn't all that either. Now the gumbo my fiance had. Was not appealing at all. It was a dark thick gravy and it had very little Seafood. I'm from Baton Rouge Louisiana so I know traditionally how Gumbo should look and taste, bottom line it was not good at all. \n\nThe issue that I had was definitely the customer service, it sucked. For establishment to be that upscale and high-maintenance the hostesses were very unprofessional. \n\nThe two waiters we had made the experience a little better because they were very attentive and concerned about how our experience was but I probably won't be back.",

We walked in and were ignored by both people behind the counter. The girl (who seemed drunk) was throwing screwed up napkins around and one of them flew over the counter and hit me. No big deal, but no apology, just more hysterically loud laughter and napkin throwing. The guy noticed my son eyeing the candy and yelled at him not to touch anything. I get it, no one wants sandy little hands in the candy. But he wasn't touching anything, so this was just rude. We stood at the counter and the girl begrudgingly served us, no smile, no greeting, she didn't even look at us. Perhaps she was annoyed we had interrupted her flirting. She ran my card and then turned her back to do some weird dance for her work mate while we stood and waited, more loud shouty laughter. I'm all about a great fun atmosphere and I know I sound like a bore. But when it comes hand-in-hand with a rude attitude towards paying customers, it crosses a line.",

First, they flat out lied to me that they could not validate my restaurant.com certificate. My bad, I guess I should've listened to the one yelper that shared the same experience. Don't bother ordering $10 shrimp tacos, the shrimp are flavorless and the \"soft corn tacos\" were an abomination that I really don't know how to describe properly. I had heard such great things about their ceviche, so i decided to order the campechana. It is now sitting in my refrigerator until I figure out a way to salvage the shrimp from that disaster. The octopus is a total loss though. If you don't know how to prepare octopus without turning it into shoe leather,  do not serve it at your establishment. I honestly feel embarrassed for these people. I'm pretty certain it's generally a bad idea to throw some seafood in a cup with a bunch of ketchup and sugar, and have the balls to think that it's ok. If I could give negative stars, I would. I hope this place shuts down. The only positive is that my senior citizen relative enjoyed the asada burrito. If she had been disappointed I probably would have written a much longer review of this nightmare. It is a disgrace to food trucks across this great nation. Save your money and ffs don't support this madness.",

Each time we've gone, we've waited to be seated with barely anyone in the restaurant and not acknowledged by the staff. When the hostess finally came up she was like a zombie and was half awake. \nOur waitresses each time were different girls but both acted like they were irritated they had another table to serve. Very unfriendly and tried to rush us through the process. When we ordered we asked our waitress what the choices of sides were and she rolled her eyes and put a menu in front of us and said, \"they're listed in here\". So sorry to put you out! The chicken in my tacos was hard as a rock. When we were leaving, the hostess was at the door talking with a waitress about what they did on New Years and completely ignored us when we left. If your only job is to greet, seat, and open the door for customers, you should be fired because you couldn't handle one aspect of your job. Sorry, but if you're making your living off customers and tips, learn some customer service and get your attitude straight.",

We arrived at 10:50 am for brunch. Apparently the kitchen closes at 11:00am. We were unaware. We stood in line behind about 10 people for close to 5 minutes. At 10:56 the cashier angrily came over and announced the kitchens closes at 11:00 and they are cutting us off. No apology, not even any eye contact. She pointed to the person standing directly in front of me and said you are the last to be served. There was only 2 of us left. She wouldn't even accommodate 2 more people 5 minutes before the kitchen was closing. She, Rae as we later asked for her name, does not understand customer service. We had been patiently waiting and had arrived before the closing of the kitchen and she didn't even have the decency to apologize. She stomped away and was abrupt to ever person that came to her register next. We left without even ordering coffee. We were not going to stand for horrible service and give these people our money.",

If 0 stars was an option I would have selected that considering that the waitress attempted to murder my friend. The orders began as normal with myself and my friends informing the waitress that someone in our group is severely allergic to cucumber and that none of our dishes can contain cucumber. She said \"okay, the beef dish contains cucumber so do you want it taken out?\" We said \"yes\". The first order of dishes came out without cucumber and all was fine. The second order of dishes did not go well as cucumber was included on the dish. We asked the bus boy to take the dish back and he said he would have to get the waitress who came back and yelled at us that we did not inform her of a food allergy. She continuously yelled stating \"you ordered it like this\", \"I only brought what you ordered\", \"you get what you asked for\" and proceeded to get closer to my friend and yell in her face while my friend calmly tried to explain that we said we cannot have any cucumber on the table. She took the plate and then had the bus boy bring it back without cucumber. Given the severity of the allergy, we moved the plate to the opposite of our friend. We were unsure if the plate was taken back and just replated without cucumbers and felt that anaphylaxis wasn't worth it. After yelling, she refused to come back to our table the rest of the night and sent bus boys to take our requests. If you or anyone here has any food allergy, it's not worth the risk because even normal forewarning is useless here and if you try to clear up any misunderstanding the waitress may yell at you like they are from WWE. The busboys deserve all the credit for making the night salvageable as they were attentive, courteous, and on top of it.",

    "text": "We scheduled massages and lunch for a special Christmas girls-day-out with my mother and sister-in-law, but we're not told that their spa facilities were most unusable and under construction. Only once we checked in and changed into our robes and inquired about the hot tubs and pools, were we told they were closed. The other women in the locker room were equally surprised at the closures. The whole spa smelled like cement powder and the only spa option for is while we waited was the sauna/steam room. When we asked for a refund, the spa manager, Dawn, was aggressively rude to my mother as she said refunds were not an option. She offered us day credits but since we are from out of town, this wasn't a viable option. Only once we asked for the hotel manager and waited for almost 30 minutes at the checkin desk did someone (not Dawn) apologize for the hassle and let us know we wouldn't be charged for the treatments we didn't receive in a mostly facility unprepared to host us anyway. My prior experience with the spa was positive but now that they were so secretive about the true state of the facility and so stubborn about making it right, I can truly say I will never give them another chance... And what a bummer because it was our Christmas present. :(",

Friends would get a beer there, tell me about, then I would go and they would say they never got it in.  When I call them out on it then its unsurprisingly sold out.

    "text": "Vegetarians beware! I went to Fez last night with my husband and two of our friends. Our friends ordered the 8-course meat feast, and my husband and I got the vegetarian feast (we're strict vegetarians, and for me, it's a serious ethical/moral issue). They brought us the bastilla (a pastry filled with egg and cinnamon - one with chicken, one without), and halfway through our course, I realized that the bastilla the waiter labeled as vegetarian actually had little bits of chicken in it. Not okay. Then, they took away my husband's drink before he was finished with it (he wasn't looking and didn't notice - but it still was about 1/3 full). The service was terrible - we had to ask for bread three times before anyone brought us any, and the waiter was very inattentive. My friend decided we'd had enough and asked to just pay for the portion of the feast that we'd already eaten. They gave him a hard time but finally complied. SO not worth what we'd paid. It's a shame- I used to love this place, but I won't be going back. The last time we were there with friends, we each had maybe 1 drink each (6 people), and they put SIXTEEN drinks on our bill - yes, 10 drinks more than what we'd consumed - and tried to tell us we were too drunk to remember what we'd had. It seems like a lot of other Yelp reviewers have had similar experiences with fishy charges being added to the bill, so if you do go (I don't recommend it!), make sure you check your bill very carefully.",

Went for a long needed date night with my fianc\u00e9 and felt like we were pushed out the door even tho the place was basically empty. Arrived at 6pm and was out by 6:30. Very good for a quick lunch but not for a nice date night. Bill was brought to us even before we asked. The worst of it all was 30 mins after I got home a was feeling very ill and was running back and forth from the washroom all night. Literally water coming out of my butt. Not cool! I called to let them know and asked to talk to the manager. The employee told me there was no manager available but he insisted I can't handle spicy foods and that's why I was so sick. I told him I eat Sombal and sriracha like ppl eat ketchup and can handle spicy, I eat very spicy foods on a regular basis. He was very rude and made me feel bad about what happened. I just wanted to let him know what happened. Not cool Numchok Wilai. U just lost a 10 year long customer. I'm a hairstylist and recommend ur restaurant to all my clients today as I talked about my date night. I'll make sure to reject that.",

When we sat down the woman immediately took the chop sticks off the table and brought back forks. Then we ordered hot tea and when we got that we weren't quite ready to order so we said we needed a few minutes. Once we were ready I couldn't get anyone to come over for at least 15 minutes. I finally flagged down someone who was running by. \n\nThe BBQ pork wonton soup was ok. The Mongolian beef was supposed to be spicy, but came out really bland.\n\nA quick 30-40 minute lunch took over 1 hour and 15 minutes. Kind of ridiculous. \n\nWe skipped the bakery but will eventually try to just walk in and pick up something next time, not sitting down to eat.",

The rest, just the worst experience I have ever had at a brunch, the absolute worst! There were seven of us who waited and waited and waited for our food while others who came in after us ordered, ate and left. After an hour and 15 minutes, one of the people in our party had to leave and cancelled her order. The waitress told us they hadn't started on any of our orders at that point. Unbelievable!!!! I told the waitress I was extremely dissatisfied with the situation snd told her to share that with the manager. Truly THE WORST RESTAURANT EXPERIENCE.

    "text": "We used to go to Landry's in the French Quarters. It was one of our go to places during Jazz Fest. We noticed that it has re-opened on the north east side of the Jax Brewery Building. It looked good because it had an upstairs and an outside seating that overlooked the Mississippi River. That was the pros. Now the cons. When the hostess seated us she cleared the table but never came back to wipe it. There were no place settings and no dishes. Even though they were not busy everything took forever. When the crab bisque came out it was lukewarm as was the char broiled oysters. The oysters were seasoned with  way to much salt. We ordered bruschetta six oysters 2 cups of bisque and a beer. The bill was $77. Ouch. Too many great restaurants with great service and great food for far less money. Will not be back.",

    "text": "Usually have great things to say about this place. The food is usually great and followed by great service. \n\nMy last visit though was terrible! My gf and I went in and were seated quickly.  Our server Sheila was polite, friendly, and helpful.  Things did not stay this good for long.\n\nAttempt 1. I ordered a steak medium with grilled shrimp,  it came out well done. I was not mad, I alerted Sheila to the issue and she immediately placed a reorder for me. So far so good. \n\nAttempt 2. Sheila told us the manager was going to bring out the new one. This is where things start to get bad. He brings it out and does not say anything except \" Steak? \". Followed by, \" Can you cut into it to make sure it's right?\". It's rare. Still not mad. He said he will have them throw it back on .\n\nAttempt 3. Sheila comes by a moment later and asks where the steak is, I again alert her to the issue and she goes to check on it. Again not mad. Sheila has been dealing with this as best she can . The manager's behavior makes it clear why she is with the customers and he's in the back . Sheila comes back out and informs us that my steak will be on them because of the issue with the reorder . \n\n  Well now the manager brings out my steak again. It's the same steak I cut into before . He asks me to cut into it, and it's not evenly cooked . The half I previously cut is medium and the middle/rest is still bleeding and rare. At this point it's late. My gf is finished with her meal and I'm tired of trying.  While I still do not feel mad I inform the manager that it will suffice.  Then out of no where this guy says,\" I guess it doesn't matter I'm paying for it anyway.\".\n\n What hell? You have had 3 tries to cook a steak medium and failed!  Now you are going to give me attitude?  My gf and I looked at each other, I smiled and told her we're  never going back .",

    "text": "Well, my bf and I were going to eat here for his birthday (a Sunday night) and off we went. The place is the size of a shoebox. Seriously. It is one of the smallest restaurants I have ever seen. Considering Jose Garces opened this post Iron Chef, what's his excuse? Anyway, we were informed it would be a half hour wait and had to give them our name (OK) and cell phone (odd). We were, of course, asked if we would like to sit at the bar. We went back, sidled passed a waiter or two and quickly realized there was absolutely no seating at the bar. I told the hostess we would be having a drink elsewhere, and to please keep our name on the list. So, we went and had a beer elsewhere, and about a half hour later, I asked my BF if his phone had rang at all. It had not. He called VW and was informed that they had called. We went back to VW and the hostess chirped that it was their policy to call twice. I said I had a hard time believing that as my bf's phone showed no missed calls, no messages, nothing. She said we could wait another half hour, if we liked. I almost told her to go eff herself. My bf used their bathroom and we went to Standard Tap instead. \n\nSo the 1 star is for their total lack of space and lame waiting list procedure. \n\nThe food I saw looked good though. \n\nMaybe I will go on a Monday at 4:00 or something.",

The honey bar is amazing. \n\nThat being said, last time I went here, *I don't remember what I ordered, honestly* I took it home for my husband and I, and when I opened my container, a beetle crawled out.... I was so horrified and disgusted, I didn't know what to do. When I dumped out the container, there was another one in the bottom. I had not touched the containers or opened the bag prior to getting home and there is no way they came from anywhere but inside the restaurant.\n\nI don't know what happened or how they got there, but despite liking the restaurant as an option, I cannot bring myself to go back. \n\nHoping this was an isolated experience, but it was horrifying.",

All of the prices have been raised and most breakfast specials are no longer available on the weekend when most people go there for breakfast. $8.99 for an order of pancakes with meat? Crazy. Waitress Ashley apologized for the new menu but then walked away when I said we were going to leave. Never offered to get a manager to see if he/she could offer another option, which is what a good waitress should have done. Instead of spending money on new menus leave well enough alone. I'll never go back. \nP.s. Do they realize that Philly has 2 L's?",

    "text": "I could just copy and paste the majority of the reviews into this box, but I guess I will share my experience first hand.\n\nAt first, I thought it was a farmers market. I texted my friend asking her what time we should go so I knew when to cook dinner and she told me to hold off dinner - I was going to get stuffed at this event.\n\nShe was dead wrong.\n\nWhen we arrived around 7:30 we found it super packed. Long long times, tight crowds, lots of dogs and babies. We circled the event trying to pick out which line we were going to devote our entire night to standing in, and decided on the Jamaican truck. After an hour of standing in line, and having other line go-ers friends casually jip us, we finally made it to the front to order only to have the vendor announce they were out of all of my meal options.\n\nSo you know what I had for dinner the evening of Night Market? A bag of chips from CVS.\n\nThis event had it's potential. But I guess they were not counting on the ridiculous horde of hungry people. Most trucks were placing \"SOLD OUT\" signs just as we were arriving. There were very few vegetarian/vegan options... (actually, don't believe any food vendors had vegan options). Hopefully next time they will be able to work out their kinks.",

It took well over an hour to get our food so we didn't eat until noon and our server never came by the table to check on us during that time. I can only write about my food but the hollandaise sauce was not hollandaise but some loose, broken sauce - It was more like melted butter than anything. Half the table hated their food and the other half liked it. I will NEVER come here again, instead I will head to Tampa or go to Kikis for breakfast.",

    "text": "I know, what should I expect from a rundown Burger King at 8th & Market? But today's experience was really beyond pathetic. \n\nI waited for 20 minutes this morning for my simple order of 2 breakfast sandwiches and hash browns. The workers showed no interest at all in helping customers or making food. The cashier took an order, then slouched off to do something in the back, no apologies. The line extended to the door. \n\nI could see in the kitchen they were slowly cooking a couple items, and frying a small basket of hash browns. With the number of people in line they should have had a double order of everything on the grill and been hustling to get it all done. \n\nIt took 10 minutes just to get to the cashier and place my order. Then I stood against a wall and waited another 10. I watched 6 people who were behind me in line get their food first. When I finally asked if they'd skipped me they said \"no your order is almost ready.\" But there was no reason mine should have taken longer. They were just apathetic, half asleep and verging on mean with their annoyance at customers who didn't come when their number was called. \n\nAfter all that, the sandwiches were sloppily put together, egg hanging out the sides, and wrapped with the inside of the wrapper on the outside. \n\nSo if by posting this I can get even ONE person to avoid this place, I will feel I've done my job.",
