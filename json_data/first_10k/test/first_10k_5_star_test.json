I keep hearing that they've gotten super slow and that the food is gross. I I went here yesterday and it was Lightning Fast service. My salad was delicious , I got a bread basket and tons of food. Everything was out faster than I even think McDonald's could bring food out. It was not expensive. Sure I can think of plenty of better restaurants but this is a diner and I can't think of any diners in the area that are better than this",

    "text": "Since moving to Fishtown this summer, my other half and I have had a few meals at Lloyd, and we consider it to be one of our favorite spots in the neighborhood.\n\nMeal favorites: For Sunday brunch, I loved the McLloyd - pancakes smothered in maple syrup with eggs, cheese, and sausage - perfect if you like sweet and savory together for breakfast. He had the Cuban Benedict special, which had an excellent flavor. They have great food specials for dinner and brunch, but some of our dinner favorites include the savory chicken waffle small plate (shareable) and the Lloyd Burger.  \n\nYou can't go wrong with drinks. The bourbon sweet tea is amazing, and the Manhattan was one of the best I've ever had. We have also tried some of their whiskey flights, which are reasonably priced and great whiskeys that we might not have otherwise stumbled upon. Last but not least, they have great happy hour specials, and the classic Citywide shot and beer combo. \n\nThis is a great spot any day of the week. We enjoy the low key atmosphere and friendliness of the waitstaff and bartenders.",

    "text": "They deliver, which is good because I've noticed I've gotten fat and lazy over the years. I ordered from Golden Triangle last night but I can't remember the details because of the fat and the lazy. \n\nI think I ordered roti cani, but I can't be sure. Definitely some sort of Indian chili chicken which was delish -- the sauce was a fascinating blend of red curry, brown sugar and about 15 other spices I can't put my finger on.\n\nI eschewed a side dish in favor of 2 desserts -- the peanut pancakes, which look and taste exactly as you'd imagine and the falooda/faluda, one of the single most delicious, creatively concocted beverages a have ever had the pleasure of slurping down in 40 seconds. This thing is traditionally made from mixing rose syrup, vermicelli, sweet basil (sabza/takmaria) seeds, and pieces of jelly with milk, often topped off with a scoop of ice cream.\n\nSounds bizarre. Google it and see. It's okay, I'll wait.\n\nWell that took you long enough! See what I mean? Crazy, right? I cannot recommend it highly enough.\n\nBonus: You can grab some scene cred just by eating a few of these Malaysian things no one has ever heard of.\n\n***** Would faluda again.",

    "text": "Food:\nThe best selection of bruschetta.  My favorite is the goat cheese and pesto unfortunately for some reason they took that off the menu - which I'd like to go on record as saying I am upset about that.  My second favorite (which is still on the menu) is the Pistachio herbed Ricotta with Lavender Honey.  Tria's food is on the lighter side.  Usually when I go with someone else we load up on brushetta and cheese and split a panino.  One of my favorites is the Smoked Chicken panino.  During happy hour they have good beer specials.  If you don't feel like drinking while you there I recommend the passionberry iced tea.  It's bottomless - can't beat that.\n\nService:\nI've been here countless times and never had a problem with the service.  Everyone is nice and the food comes out quickly.\n\nAmbiance:\nIt depends which one you go to.  The one around 13th is bigger and has nice heated outside seating.  The one at 17th and sansom is smaller and since you can't make a reservation you have to get there before 5 to get a table.  The inside are both are basically the same.  Hardwood floors and a nice bar.  Candle at the table.  It can get a bit loud but other than that it's a nice place to eat.",

    "text": "Slice of Life in New Port Richey:\nI'm in heaven! Real NY-style pizza!!! The thin crust is delicious; the sauce has that unique flavor I've been missing since moving to California; the topping choices are interesting and well prepared. Yesterday we went the slice route instead of ordering a whole pie because it gave us a chance to sample different pies. Ted really enjoyed the \"ranch\" slice and I thought the \"white\" cheese slice was delicious. We both love the everything pie We tried the meat-lovers but felt the pancetta made it a bit too salty. next up: the Florentine\n\nWe love this place!!! Mario is a pizza master chef IMHO!!! Ted thought I didn't like pizza because I rarely order it. Now he knows why: growing up with real NY pizza like this spoils you for eating the junk other places serve!!!\n\nThere are 3 pizza places with the same name but completely different owners and staff. When I read the negative reviews I can't believe they are at the same Slice of Life in New Port Richey off Embassy and Little Rd. This review is for the Slice of Life Pizza restaurant in the Winn-Dixie shopping center on Little Rd.",

Stopped by after working up an appetite running errands in town and we happened to show up during happy hour - two for one drinks (possibly also applies to alcoholic drinks, but we both got boba teas instead)\n\nThe scallion pancakes were a perfect appetizer. They came out hot, crispy, and a little oily, delicious.\n\nThe tonkatsu chicken and fried tofu bao were both delicious. All the condiments on their bao make for a sort of savory, sort of sweet flavor combo (cilantro, sweet sauce, and a few other things I don't remember off the top of my head)\n\nThe popcorn chicken was also excellent. Tiny, very crispy bits of chicken served with rice and a potato salad. I didn't try the potato salad, but heard it was more of a macaroni salad. \n\nI highly recommend Taiwan 101. Food is cooked quickly, staff are nice, and everything I've tried so far is absolutely delicious.",

I enjoyed a mimosa and scone as I waited, and was thrilled when it was brought out.  The presentation was as exquisite as the cake itself, complete with a signature box tied up in ribbon.  I took a menu to share with my group, and magically served the 8\" cake to the masses (usually serves 8-10) once I made the grand entrance.   \n\nI must admit, I've never spent that much on a cake that size, but the raves that were received and interest in where it came from were proof enough (if not the crumbs in the box) to affirm my decision was a stellar one.  My boss also mentioned he'd never had a cake as delicious!  I'll be sure to bring this up when it's time for my review.",

Second, they have such a large range of spices that you can smell, taste a little, and purchase. Yes, there's a large overwhelming variety of spices, but fear not! Their knowledgeable staff is available and more than happy to assist you in finding the right spice you are looking for all your cooking needs. Over the years I've purchased many items from here and I can attest that they do last a long time (about a year, year and a half, including some stuff I use often!). I see all kind of specialty salts for example (onion salt, celery salt) as well as sugars and powders (lavender vanilla sugar, vanilla bean powder). Their products even seem to taste fresher (I can taste a difference between their cinnamon and nutmeg and what I can get at a dollar store, for example). The prices aren't too bad and they last long. My three bottles pictured cost about $19, but that will last a good year, so its worth it to me.",

They are meaty, the sauce is great, and I usually always have to take some home for the next day.  I went with a fairly large group and got to sample different things on the menu.  I highly recommend the onion rings!  They have a large selection of beer as well.  Since I heard they were a \"soccer bar\" I did not know what to expect when I first arrived.  However, the atmosphere is great.  It is full of fans of all different sports and the staff is willing to show whatever sport you want to watch on TV.  The service was excellent.  No one in my group had to ask for one thing while we were there.  I highly recommend this place to anyone who is up for a great meal, great service and a great time with friends.",

The two years I've taken part in this event have just been a blast.\n\nThe Schlafly event room in the back-- I forget the name of it, but I think it has one-- is just a fun and unique place to have a private event.  The view of the Bottleworks is impressive, and the huge private bar set up on the side is just great.  I think the cost is pretty reasonable for us, too, which includes unlimited beer/wine per head along with a bunch of delicious hors d'oeuvre.\n\nI'm a member of the group that helps put the event on this year, and I definitely think we're sticking with the Bottleworks again.  Look forward to an updated review around February or March next year!",

I'm very happy with this location and the servers I have encountered so far have been helpful and pleasant.\n\nThe katsu is great and I highly recommend it to people looking for a more filling dish on the menu. The bao buns were also good for a lighter fish. I haven't had anything I really regretted trying, but definitely ask your server about the portion sizes of each dish since they vary across the menu.\n\nThe cocktail selection is excellent. I even had a special Japanese Old Fashioned last time which was a little expensive, but well worth it for some quality Japanese whiskey. \n\nI'm looking forward to exploring the menu little by little. The best way to experience this is in a group setting so you can try more things and it really reminds me of Izakayas or Japanese pubs I visited in Japan and Korea.",

Monday's and Tuesday's are 50% off price of wine bottles! Great deal if you want to drink.  We received some really great bread with oil/vinaigrette for the start of our meal.

I had one of the specials for the night - lobster ravioli with a rose sauce ($16.95) and my friend had the coloured rotini pasta with spinach and switched the sauce to a rose sauce ($18.95).

I ordered the famed cornmeal pancakes with a side of hash browns and a fried egg.  My girlfriend ordered the banana pancakes with a side of bacon.  Everything was amazing.  The pancakes were hearty but fluffy... The side of bacon only comes with three pieces which is disappointing,  but it was cooked to her liking.  The cornmeal pancakes had just the right amount of everything... Bacon,  peppers... Salsa, sour cream,  syrup... Yes,  all of that.

I also unfortunately have a broken cap on my front tooth ( ugh) so I had to order something that was soft and good for a tooth problem. The flavors screamed old world Italian and kids/adults were very happy with their meals. I had a pesto sauce on a long thin noodle - cooked to perfection. There was chicken parm at the table and it was not overly fried- very tender and flavorful.  This is A+.",

I don't the know owners name but he is the nicest guy. Very friendly. The food was delicious but it might have been wise for us to confirm what we thought we were ordering. Indian food is delicious but I am horrible at remembering what I ordered before. Unfortunately this review is another victim of my not being able to remember the names of what we ordered. One dish was mostly spinach (a total hit), another was some red chicken dish (perfectly cooked but looked like it was dyed red), and naan which is everyone's favorite. If you know your Indian dishes you won't be disappointed. Kids are always welcome there. Be sure to enjoy downtown while you're there.",

Right from the fish tank in the cooking pot on your plate. Don't expect a fancy restaurant with a nice ambiance because this is not the reason you come here (though the outside seating has a nice ocean/harbor view). It is the variety of fresh shellfish prepared according to your appetite and taste buds. The wait can be long during peak hours but it is worth it.

There is no way I, or anyone for that matter, would have found this place if it weren't for someone just like you doing a review. Thanks guys!\n\nTucked away in a strip shopping center, albeit a cute shopping center, is this little non descript  restaurant. Since it was early in the day, we really weren't worried about a reservation although I did call as a just in case measure.\n\nWe wanted to sit outside since the back looks so pretty but were told it was closed but were led instead to an enclosed patio. Still nice. \n\nNicer still was when our server brought us bread, olive oil and a plate of marinated cannelloni beans with yellow and green squash. Wow! The squash were just a tad bland and needed salt but the beans were really flavorful.\n\nMy husband ordered the squash blossoms stuffed with ricotta and mozzarella cheese and I the beef carpaccio. Although I did miss capers on the beef and there was too much salad, both the dishes were really good.\n\nNow, our server gave us the list of specials and mentioned that two of them were served with langostines. I had seen these on one of the cooking shows but didn't know exactly what they were. My husband ordered the Carbonarra and I got the Langostines with a blush sauce served with lump crab and fresh tomato.\n\nMy dish was pricey, yes it was but incredibly worth it. Imagine a cross between a lobster, a shrimp and butter. Really. The langostines simply melt in your mouth leaving happiness behind. The carbonarra with panchetta instead of bacon my husband ordered is the best I've ever ordered or even tried to make. \n\nAs I've said, we were really early so we got to watch the prep of the restaurant between the the lunch and the dinner service. It was truly a privilege. These servers went through the place with precision, dusting, wiping, washing and primping every aspect of the restaurant. \n\nIf you go, and you should, bring a nice bottle of wine, order the langostines and the tiramisu. Enjoy!",

He was super friendly, making sure to talk to everyone and was happy he didn't have to deport anyone for not liking his food, which I don't think is possible.\n\nThe sandwich was bigger than I expected and loaded.  There was more ham on it than I normally eat at Christmas dinner, yet at the end, I was somehow wanting more.  The black bean soup was the perfect side dish.

I never doubt the quality of the drink here, because the milk is really quite good. Also, some of the baristas here have some stunning latte art. Don't know what that is? You should ask one of them, they're all very experienced with what they're talking about. That's another great reason to come here - not only is there quality of service, but there's also friendliness. The baristas are always very kind, helpful, and informative about what it is they do. \n\nNot only is everything about the service great, the atmosphere is really cool too. I often find the art that they put up on their walls interesting and unique, and they change it out about once a month. The wood and white theme they have going on is very aesthetically pleasing, as well as nicely calming. \n\nThis is definitely one of my favorite places to go!",

We received the Fiesta cake by accident, and the server was kind enough to allow us to keep both slices of cake. The cookie was crispy on the outside but chewy on the inside. Could've used a little bit more sea salt but the chocolate chips were so fudgey and rich so I didn't have much to complain about. The campfire cake was delicious. The cake is moist and fluffy, while the whipped cream is chocolatey. Reminded me of the days I'd come back home from school on a winter day and I'd rip one of those Swiss Miss packets open into warm milk. The buttercream is made with Swiss Miss by the way!

The batter wasn't thick, and it has a crispiness to it that was a great contrast to the moistness and juiciness of the fish.  I have to admit, when I'm not sure what to get I think of getting a burger or fish & chips, and there weren't any burgers on the dinner menu.  The serving size was 3 cod pieces, approx 4-6 oz, along with a generous serving of fries. Additionally, the tartar sauce appeared to be made in house, had a great flavor.  So, if you're in the mood for fish and chips, I would highly recommend getting them here...because while the serving size isn't as big as Great Basin's, it tastes way better.\n\nMy wife had the salmon tacos, and for the side she had the chicken tortilla soup.  While the tacos had some great flavors the salmon was a bit overcooked, thus making the tacos a bit overshadowed by the soup.  Similar to the fish & chips above, the serving size wasn't large, only 2 tacos, but again, the flavors were very good.\n\nIf you're starving and want a large meal with leftovers I'd recommend other places, but if you want a satisfying meal that's an appropriate size this place is very good.",

The d\u00e9cor isn't one to write home about, primarily greenish booths that can be a little tight for those with a belly.  But I must say it looks better now than it did 25 years ago.\n\nThe menu has lots of items; soup, noodles, rice, and entrees and most under $10.  They give you a pen and paper to write down your order and we ordered 2 items using the menu number.  The black bean rice noodles came with lots of sauce and vegetables.  My colleague ordered the seafood with vegetables which had shrimp, fried squid, and squid.  Both of the dishes were good, but I liked the noodles better.\n\nThe prices are cheap, and our meal came to $20 with leftovers too! Come for the good food and don't expect much for service or atmosphere.  Or you could also order take out if you don't want to eat it.  They only take cash though but there's at ATM in the restaurant.",

This is the old Filo's, I spent many nights there having a few drinks,  listening and dancing to great music by the Worship crew, then walking home. \n\nWe decided to check this place out one Friday night when a friend from out of town was visiting. It was the perfect atmosphere and food in the downstairs lounge area. The music the dj was playing was great and funky, yet not too loud, so that we could still hold a conversation. The food was spectacular, we had the Ceviche de Callos con Sandia (watermelon and scallop ceviche), I wasn't sure what to expect, it was not like the typical ceviche I have had before, but it was delicious. We also had the Queso Fundido, one with chorizo and the other with mushrooms. They were both devine!\n\nThey also have a reverse happy hour special in the lounge: Thursday - Saturday, 10pm-12am. We had some tasty margaritas (although not the best I have had, but good enough for the price), and we were feeling really nice by the time we left there, not too full, it was the perfect amount of food, and we still had some $ in our pocket!\n\nI am definitely looking forward to going back to Xochitl.",

Professional but not overbearing or obvious. \n    A little disappointed that they were out of two ingredients for one of their signature cocktails, but it WAS the day before Mardi Gras.\n   The bread and butter at the table was excellent. Crunchy outside, soft inside.\n   The beets salad was so much better and different from similarly named items at other restaurants. The greens literally tasted like they had been picked from a sun warmed field minutes before.\n    G's Choucroute was a meaty fiesta. He loved it. My crab ravioli was lovely with a delicate Meyer lemon sauce. \n    Bread pudding for dessert was just how we like it - sans raisins.\n    Truly a memorable meal.

First- the people who own it and work there daily are always incredibly nice and polite.  The food is great, meat is tender and veggies are very fresh and the shrimp are decent size. Portions are a good value .  The menu is a little more limited than a more upscale fine dining Chinese place but better than most fast food Chinese places.   Sometimes they do offer specials that aren't on the regular menu.   An extra nice feature is if I'm too lazy to leave the house, that they deliver!

You can absolutely taste the difference.  I highly recommend Organico.",

This Reno location couldn't have been more different. The place was packed so I opted for the drive thru, there were 4 employees, well dressed, clean with superior manners and excellent customer service . They were polite, helpful and fast. They got my order right and the sandwiches were far better than my first visit in Bakersfield. This place is about as squared away as it gets. Way to far exceed my expectations, Well done !",

I love the food, the casual atmosphere and the staff is professional and welcoming.  \nThey are adjacent to my hotel every time I come to NOLA so I am here at least once per visit.  \nI wanted to step outside my comfort zone and try something else today for a late lunch but when I sat at the bar, ordered a glass of wine and was given the menu- I didnt see what I wanted ( I had seen it on the lunch menu).  I wanted oysters, as in welcome to NOLA - oysters.  They would not serve them at the bar so I drank my wine and left. \nHere I am back at LUKE for my third meal this week.  And I got those oysters. \nI also got a warm welcome, great beer and hello - happy hour!  Thank you John Besh for doing what you do.  #superstar #kingofnola",

As\u00ed que, un jueves de verano, las fuimos a buscar cerca de las 21.30 horas.\nEntramos y nos pareci\u00f3 muy ameno, limpio y confortable para comer ah\u00ed. Nos atendi\u00f3 un hombre muy amable y atento.\nPedimos los siguientes sabores:\n- prosciutto (jam\u00f3n crudo);\n- ham (jam\u00f3n cocido);\n- pepperoni;\n- cebolla;\n- hongos;\n- anchoas y\n- albahaca y tomate.\n\nLas pizzas tardaron 25/30 minutos. Todos sus gustos -de los cuales subo foto- estuvieron deliciosos. El estilo de pizza fue a la piedra, con salsa de tomate y queso muzzarela en una cantidad ideal.\nSi bien este comentario parece limitarse \u00fanicamente a una estricta relaci\u00f3n precio-calidad, no menos verdad es que, en mi opini\u00f3n, la calidez con la que fuimos recibidos reflej\u00f3 c\u00f3mo hubiera sido el trato de haber decidido cenar ah\u00ed mismo.\nNo dudo en valorar a este lugar con cinco estrellas.",

I've ordered delivery from them three times and have dined in once. The delivery was exceptionally quick, which makes me believe that most of the food is already made before you order it. It's not piping hot and fresh, but it still tastes great. The buffalo bella and fries are definitely my favorite items. If you're looking for something more upscale, try Vedge, but if you're starved and you need a quick vegan bite delivered to your office quickly, you can't go wrong with HipCity.",
