Their black and white latte is probably the best I've ever had (not too sweet and just the right amount of foam), soups are always really good (even for non-soup people) and there's just a lot of space to do work. The noise level is perfect, the music is at a perfect level, and I always enjoy when patrons bring their dogs. I'll keep giving them my business for as long as I can.",

Took the boy for his birthday and put our name in, had a drink around the corner while we waited and were given seats at the bar after about 45 minutes. \n\nWe were waited on by Keith, the bartender, who was congenial, knowledgeable about his whiskeys and an all-around cool guy. We started with 3 cape may salts (two for me, one for the boy) and tater tots, both of which made me happy.\n\nFor dinner, I got Kentucky Fried Quail (stellar, though the succotash was not as exciting as I wanted it to be) and the boy got the 24$ Fois Gras burger, which was incredible. Worth every penny. The duckfat fries were pretty yummy, but not even the best part of the meal. I could've done without the cheese sauce, but as it was on the side I wasn't deterred.\n\nI look forward to coming back here, with everyone I know.",

    "text": "We were a bit weary about trying the Shellfish Company on the Wharf as more often than not, many places like these (see Cannery Row, Monterey) feast on a captive audience and provide sub-standard fare at high prices.\n\nHowever, emboldened by the perennial good reviews on Yelp, we suppressed our initial observations and went ahead with the trying it out. The place is small, so definitely plan ahead. You will have to wait, so either you know, just do so, or perhaps try to visit outside of peak hours. Luckily, our wait was only about 20 minutes as the dinner rush was just leveling off.\n\nThe special was the local rock crab - $25 for 3 lbs of California Rock Crab, salad, and your choice of soup/chowder. After taking a look at a few trays of rock crab being served out, the wife and I both opted for it, as it looked awesome.  \n\nThe salad/chowder combo was great as you actually received hearty portions of each, so it was a good start. As much as I liked the chowder however, the Shrimp Bisque the wife ordered was amazing, so I would recommend that going forward. \n\nBut enough of prattling on about side dishes: the rock crab tasted just as glorious as it looked. Juicy, buttery chunks of white crab meat await you, just a few cracks away. While the rock crab shells are pretty thick, once cracked, they splinter and separate easily, a good sign they are cooked to perfection. The rock crabs provided a great amount of meat for what I felt to be the least amount of work you're going to do for crab, King or otherwise. \n\nWe were thoroughly satisfied with our meal and along with the special being an overall great value, devouring the Rock Crab at SBSC turned out to be one of the favorite meals on the trip. I think ordering crab here is a safe proposition indeed.",

    "text": "I LOVE Weaver's Way and really disagree with some of the content in previous reviews. WW is not necessarily meant for convenience shopping. I am a single woman and I find that I have no trouble shopping at the co-op, during peak times or otherwise. I actually find the co-op to be a great place to shop if you live alone because I can get smaller quantities of items than if I shop at the corporate stores like Acme. I also enjoy the work hours - I've worked throughout the store, but most recently, I have been getting in my hours by participating in the membership committee. I wouldn't say that the community is necessarily made up of \"tree huggers\" and \"earth children\", though. The community is made up of a variety of similarly-minded folks from different backgrounds. I enjoy having a place to go to where I can obtain locally grown produce, a place that offers more natural, wholesome, and preservative-free foods than chain stores with prices way below that of Whole Foods. I enjoy interacting with other members and contributing to my local and global community. I don't find the membership fee or the work hours to be prohibitive being a single person vs. a family. I don't think that membership in a co-op is for everyone and, if you aren't single, it's definitely not a solo decision. If you're keen on being committed to the Weaver Way values, you couldn't find a better place to shop. If not, stick to the chain stores or just pay the 10% visitors' fee to pop in once in a while.",

    "text": "After living in the STL area for way over 10 years now, I am both ashamed and remorseful to admit that I ate here for the FIRST time just a few weeks ago. I am ashamed because it's a St. Louis tradition and remorseful because I missed out on it for so..many...years! \n\nThis place is amazing. What is not to love! It's a factory where you can get a tour (Friday-Sunday, noon-5pm on the hour), there's a shop, bar, and dining area. They also host many event with live music on the weekends. It's fun to just kind of wander and look around - don't worry, you'll get a chance because there will likely be a wait before you dine. The beer is, of course, amazing. The Hefeweizen is my personal favorite and a great start for anyone who is not a huge beer drinker (like myself). Additionally, the food is homegrown and damn good. I had the pizza (recommendation from my server) and it was really spectacular, though I'm admittedly a pizza connoisseur so I enjoy a good pizza pie more than most probably ;P My date had a bison burger which was also really good. \n\nMore fun info: the service is great! I think they tend to hire more funky and alternative people (like tattoo parlor staff) which I support. The quality is what makes this place stand out along with the emphasis on local food and brewery. \n\nIt is a little on the pricier side but for all the experience you get and the quality, it is worth it. I will go again and again and you probably should, too!",

Holly cow this place kicked butt and we didn't even have to wait in line!! We were lucky to miss the rush said our waitress.   I had this super savory corn pancake with bacon, salsa, and sour cream. So good. This place will always be a stop when I get back to the south~~~",

    "text": "Milktooth is the place to go if you want a good breakfast cocktail and a twist on traditional brunch. At first glance of the menu, you may think you've never heard of any of these foods for breakfast, and you may be right. I guarantee no matter what you order, you're going to enjoy it. \n\nMilktooth is one of the most popular brunch places in Indy, which means you will typically have a wait. Trust me, it's worth the usual 30 minute wait (on weekends). To make it go by a little faster, they've got a walk up bar for their coffee drinks and pastries. Snack on one of those to give you a preview of the amazing meal you're about to have.\n\nTheir menu changes from time to time but they have a few things that stay one the menu but change ingredients. I love all of their variations on a Dutch pancake, and their raclette grilled cheese is to die for.  If you're making this a boozy breakfast, don't pass up on the michelada. And sit outside if it's warm enough!",

A friend recommended Lobster Haven and I checked it out online. Looked like a type of place we would eat at in Massachusetts when we visit family. We were not disappointed! Service was great, fast and very friendly. Huge selection of all of the favorites. You have to visit this place if you want authentic New England seafood. You can also purchase live lobster and fresh seafood to go and cook it yourself.",

The food was fantastic. My wife had the tri-tip salad -- greens on one side of the plate with a balsamic vinagrette balanced by four good-sized slices of medium-rare tri-tip and potato \"croutons\" --\nlittle heavenly bits of crunchy potatoes. I had the tri/tip/chicken combo, selecting the fresh corn salad and potato salad as my two sides. It was so good that we ordered dessert as well (not something I do regularly). The offering was lemon meringue, mudd pie, apple pie, and ice cream. We shared the first -- again delicious, with real, perfectly set and browned meringue. The prices were very reasonable for the quality of food and the experience. We've already recommended to family and friends locally, and expect to return soon. Well done!",

It's no longer there-used to be next to restrooms. There is still a payphone back there which I love. There are now ATM's at front entrance.\n  The blue ribbon is now $3.79, but still a bargain since it includes everything: pancakes, 2 eggs, toast, sausage, bacon,juice & coffee. I ate here with my kids. My daughter's choice. Says she \"loves Tom Jones\". Our meals included blue ribbons, french toast, chicken, club sandwich & baked potato . Everyone gets what they like. \n   I don't smell stale smoke and would not call it dirty.  I like the \"loud\" orange booths. I feel like I went back in time with these and the payphone. Service is always fast and I always seem to get a different waitress. Don't know where they find these young ladies but they're good. I've seen different managers there and they are all quick and on top of things-which makes a good manager.\n   Since it's my daughter's fave I'm bumping it up from 4 to 5 stars.",

Second, they have such a large range of spices that you can smell, taste a little, and purchase. Yes, there's a large overwhelming variety of spices, but fear not! Their knowledgeable staff is available and more than happy to assist you in finding the right spice you are looking for all your cooking needs. Over the years I've purchased many items from here and I can attest that they do last a long time (about a year, year and a half, including some stuff I use often!). I see all kind of specialty salts for example (onion salt, celery salt) as well as sugars and powders (lavender vanilla sugar, vanilla bean powder). Their products even seem to taste fresher (I can taste a difference between their cinnamon and nutmeg and what I can get at a dollar store, for example). The prices aren't too bad and they last long. My three bottles pictured cost about $19, but that will last a good year, so its worth it to me.",

ITV is the kind of place that i dream about, beautiful small room, dimly lit but you can see ( as opposed to some places) and you want to see everything.  Everything in the room is beautiful including a lot of the staff, (im trying to give you the full picture here).   First thing to hit the table (or bar in this case) was a three dollar beef fat biscuit that was the best thing ive eaten in this city all year.  I verbally communicated that message to Chef Nick Elmi who graced us with his presence in the dining room (just as before at Laurel).    We went on to eat many more things which i will try to name now... Stars were Foie with Apricot Miso, Pork Cheeks with some insanely good vegetables, trout pumpernickel soldiers and one of the best cocktails ive had in a damn long time, the ouroboros.   The are playing around with cold smoking things in there and on their BAR MENU!   Honestly, place is just terrific and i meant to write this review sooner but hey... better late than never.  Now that i think of it, im getting hungry... maybe ill head to East Passyunk for some of the best this city has to offer!",

Captain Bill's had menu choices for everyone in our party, and they even made some ingredient substitutions for us. \n\nThe food arrived hot, fresh, and exactly to our specifications.

Both of us being Asian food fanatics, we are so happy to have Bab Cafe part of our ever expanding culinary experience here in Reno.\n\nWith the guidance of the very friendly and knowledgeable staff, we quickly got a hang of what to order, though there will be many more choices on our future visits.  Liking things a little spicy, we both ordered the Jeyuk Top-Bab (spicy pork).  What incredible flavor!  There is nothing that compares to this place in Reno.  The sauce bar gives you the opportunity to mix things up and the included miso soup is a definite bonus.  Great value for such a fresh, enjoyable meal.

I'm very happy with this location and the servers I have encountered so far have been helpful and pleasant.\n\nThe katsu is great and I highly recommend it to people looking for a more filling dish on the menu. The bao buns were also good for a lighter fish. I haven't had anything I really regretted trying, but definitely ask your server about the portion sizes of each dish since they vary across the menu.\n\nThe cocktail selection is excellent. I even had a special Japanese Old Fashioned last time which was a little expensive, but well worth it for some quality Japanese whiskey. \n\nI'm looking forward to exploring the menu little by little. The best way to experience this is in a group setting so you can try more things and it really reminds me of Izakayas or Japanese pubs I visited in Japan and Korea.",

    "text": "My friend and I visited Tampa for a concert, and about ten minutes away from the Atlanta airport he realized that he had purchased tickets for the wrong day. We had already made hotel reservations and bought the concert tickets, so he just had to pay same-day price for airfare: all in all about $800 more. \"It was totally worth it,\" he later told me, \"Because I got to have the best sandwich of my entire life.\"\n\nAll because we randomly picked the Bricks of Ybor from Yelp. I can't vouch for the peanut butter or meatless menu, but the meat sandwiches that we bought were absolutely phenomenal. I had the pulled pork, which was flavored with ponzu and served on Hawaiian sweet bread. It was one of the best meals I've had in a long time. We spent a few hours hanging out and drinking, during which time Brian, the owner, came out and talked to us, comped us a drink, let us try new appetizers he was developing (all for free) and generally made us feel really welcome. \n\nI kept my eyes open to the kind of crowd that came in and out of the restaurant. It seemed to draw everything from hipsters to geriatrics and strait-laced families with young kids. I think it speaks to both the diversity of the menu and the pleasant environment. We went back for drinks before and after the concert. It got very crowded but we still received excellent food, drinks and service. I give this restaurant my strongest recommendation, and it's the first place I'm going when I next visit Tampa.",

Very welcoming, warm and inviting.\n\nIt's very vegetarian friendly!  The soft tofu is stewed and put into the dol sot pots which each and every stew feels like it's custom made for you. \n\nYou can select from beef, seafood or mixed meats (seafood & beef), mushroom, and just plain.  They can adjust the spice as needed too.  I always get the extra hot with the hot temperature, can't beat it.  The rice also comes in a dol-sot which is great if you leave it in for a while, it burns the rice into a nice crispy shell.  DROOL.\n\nJust thinking about this place makes my mouth salivate!  \n\nIf you're not into tofu, they also offer korean bbq meats (cooked in the back), with other soup/stew items.\n\nLove this place!!!",

    "text": "I love trying fresh seafood on piers, wharfs and seaside markets. Most of the time, it is a disappointing experience but this place is not. The food is legitimately fresh and prepared well. The gorgeous view is just a cherry on top of nature's beautiful sundae. I have been here before but ordered the \"wrong\" thing (cioppino). That wasn't very good when I had it a couple of years ago here. \n\nWe came for a late lunch/early dinner on a Monday. Even at 4pm,  there was a wait! We waited about 25 minutes and got a table outdoor. While it wasn't ideal that we sat right in the sun with no shelter other than our sunscreen and sunglasses, the view was worth it. \n\nWe got the local crab special which was a steamed 3-lb. crab served with a salad and soup for $26. I thought this was quite the steal because the crab was huge, delicious and meaty. The garden salad was fresh as simple as it was. The lobster bisque we got was pretty good. (The other options were Caesar salad and clam chowder). They topped off the crab with a couple of onion rings and cups of cocktail sauce and drawn butter. Yum!\n\nWe also got the fried platter of shrimp, oysters, calamari and scallops for $12.95. It came with cole slaw, onion rings, tartar sauce and cocktail sauce. As greasy of a meal as this made, it was one of the better fried platters I've had anywhere. The seafood was just really fresh including the sometimes-feared fried oyster. :)\n\nThe ice in our iced teas melted away in the sun. Our waitress was so cool and brought us lots of extra ice and an extra iced tea in case we needed it (we did because it was hot out!). She was just friendly and good at her job - five stars for her!\n\nBy the time we left at about 6, there were so many people waiting. Make sure you sign up for a seat on the clipboard right when you get there. The restaurant is the last one at the very end of the pier. Parking on the pier is free for 90 minutes but it looks like a drive that will upset tires. I parked in the large lot south of the pier and walked 15 minutes up and onto the pier. It was free on a Monday late afternoon.",

I practically tried everything for breakfast and have come to the conclusion that this is the spot for breakfast. I have one gripe though, the monte cisto is not worth the price and is way over priced. I know truffle oil is used but that should not be the reason its so damn expensive. one egg, one piece of toast and some sauce. Don't ever order it, not worth it unless they drop the price $5. everything else is worth it taste great. Jebbs open face and the huevos rancheros are my favs. Enjoy. oh and the coffee is addicting.

It is an alcoholic milkshake, and I could literally go here just to drink that because it is so good.  \n\nThey bring out fresh bread and butter, and then my boyfriend and I ordered the trio of appetizers.  The trio is quite small, but it includes a duck springroll, fried chicken livers and a fried oyster.  The duck springroll came with a wonderful tangy sauce, which I greatly enjoyed.  My boyfriend enjoyed the fried chicken livers and the fried oyster, but those are not two of my favorite things.\n\nFor my entree, I ordered the shrimp and grits.  Oh my goodness... so good! The shrimp are bacon-wrapped, and the grits are true Southern grits.  I will definitely order this dish again when I get the chance to return.

    "text": "First of all, I think this might be my first Yelp review about \"fast food.\" It's not a genre I ever eat unless I'm forced to on a road trip.  However, I am from Buffalo, NY, and am a chicken-finger connoisseur, so I decided to give this place a chance.  Additionally, it was on a road trip of sorts.  We had been at the beach all day and were halfway back home to central Tampa.\n\nThe service is amazing!  I have never seen fast-food workers who take so much pride in their jobs.  These people were drinking the Zaxby's cool-aid!  They seemed more like Disney employees than fast-food workers.  Both a female counter gal and a male (possible the manager/franchisee) went out of their way to make sure we liked everything.  \n\nThe food was a solid 4 stars, but my review overall is rounded up for the above mentioned points.  We had the chicken finger sandwiches on Texas toast.  While the chicken fingers themselves were super juicy and moist, the Texas toast was too greasy to eat them on.  I love sauce and enjoyed the variety.  We tried the Zax, hot honey mustard, insane hot and ranch.  What is missing from the sauce variety, for me, is a spicy bbq and blue cheese.  Serving ranch with hot sauce is an insult to the folks in Buffalo that created the cuisine.  Aside from the bread and sauce small issues, I really enjoyed our meal.  Additionally, it was so cheap!!  $12 and change for 2 meals with drinks.  \n\nI am a fan!  This place doesn't quite hit all the marks of Buffalo-Inspired food, but it does a pretty good job of putting a southern twist on chicken fingers!",

    "text": "After a long hiatus from reviewing I have awaken from my 6 mouth yelp hibernation and my tummies a grumbles with an insatiable hunger for the cacophonous symphony of flavor that is Indian food. Like an all too familiar pattern, I go back to Mohammad Butt, my main man for marsala.\nBut whats this? \nThere are whispers that he no longer cooks for \"Best Taste of Asia,\" that he is gone, never to return; some sort of falling out.\n\nNo.\nNo, it can't be! \nI need to score - one .. final .. hit..\n\nLife ceases to have meaning, existential murmurings dog the mind. Who am I?\nWhy am I here?\nWhat is Cheeze Wiz?\nIts done, over, a round falls into the chamber and just as I prepare to end it all and pull the trigger- steps in ZAIKA.\n\nZaika - meaning the art of taste -  stays to to its name. This is a place where the Paneer (cheese) is made fresh in house, resulting in a cheese that's silky in texture. Especially when in contrast to the prepackaged rubbery bone-white LEGO blocks most small Indo-Pak places purchase from Indian Grocers in attempts to reduce prep-times. While at Zaika such shortcuts are not taken,  the Chef takes the extra steps needed to ensure a dish comes together as a whole. For example, the Chicken Makhani uses Smokey Tandoori Chicken, which I have never seen done before but it certainly aids the chicken to cut though the rich buttery tomato sauce and elevates the dish as a whole. Even entr\u00e9es like Dall Fray or  Palak Paneer  have so much flavor that they will leave you not missing animal protein in the least should you choose to go the vegetarian route. \n\nZaika 's appetizers, like the Veggie Samosa and Aloo Tikki, (spiced potato patties) are generally large, peppery and well spiced - the latter of which remind me of something my own mother would make. Though I must warn others to avoid the items that occasionally pop-up as specials like the potato stuffed chili peppers, unless they have a iron stomach or are a gluten for punishment. These peppers are spicy, not deveined or even seeded. Further, I find the fish pakora to be far too fishy.\n \nI've become rather taken by Zaikia. Even the simply things such as the naan are good there. Just right in elasticity, the bread does not have too much give and yet isn't too soft. It's nothing elaborate, just properly risen with a light texture and  no egg or yeast flavor. The only complaint being that it lacked that signature faint sweetness naan has. But hey, I use it mostly for mopping up the other good stuff on the plate anyway and the sweetness gets lost in the mix, so I don't mind at all.\n\nThe menu has nearly 120 different items, all numbered to order by, making take-out phone orders convenient and should eliminate any fears anyone should have of a language barrier problem. Furthermore, it has short descriptions of each dish - something all ethnic places like this should have.\nThough some items like Lassie (a frothy yogurt drink) do not appear on the menu, that too is offered - both a salty and sweet mango verities. \nThe head chef speaks English quite well and should be easy to deal with should you want to inquire more or want to setup large orders.\n\nI have already noticed parties negotiating catering for Ramadan as I anxiously awaited my own order.\n\nThe bottom line here is this, Mohammad Butt has expanded on the menu he once created for \"Best taste of Asia,\" and taken an all HALAL meat approach. \n\nOnly good things can come of this, only good things.\n\nP.S.\nZAIKA is right behind Nifty Fifties on Grant Ave., so you are all set for dessert should you want a milkshake. \nHowever, I would suggest getting the Ras Malai if available. These riccotta cheese dumplings flouting in soaked in sweetened, thickened milk are delicately flavored with cardamom, a very some amount of rose water and then garnished with pistachios. They are ungodly good.",

I was not disappointed!\nWe started out with the crab cake appetizer- it was very well portioned (2 large crab cakes) and the sauce with it had an interesting hint of dill (just lovely and refreshing and a little different).\nWe were feeling like comfort food and had the chicken tenders-  The portions were very generous and the food was just solid.  Not fussy or stuffy or trying hard... just good, wholesome and good to eat.\nThe service was fine- however there is only one waitress for the tables and the bar, so i can imagine that if it is full that would cause some delays.  Overall it was just a lovely meal and the prices were unbelievably reasonable (most places have crabcakes 1/2 that size for twice that price)...\nThe ambiance is nice, nothing crazy but it is just a very nice option with reasonable prices and lovely food!",

There were a few minor quirks with the service and with wine being out of stock, but I'm chalking it up to the fact that it just opened and they were working out the kinks. The owner visited our table and he could not have been nicer or more gracious. The food was excellent...nothing to change there! I had the tortelloni pansotti, and i think it was the best pasta I've ever had. I'm sure we will be frequent diners .",

We should be glad we don't all have someone looking over our shoulder attacking our motives.

I am a creature of habit and order the same tacos, but the bf has ventured out to get other dishes such as the fajita plate or the really spicy shrimp (camarones del diablo?).

But I think we have a winner here.\n\nWhen this Wawa store opened for business, gas prices at gas stations all along Concord Pike fell by 30 cents per gallon just to compete with them. Sure, this Wawa store could've followed the general pricing in the area and lowered prices just a few cents, keeping the bulk of the profit. But no, they'll have none of that. I love a store that is on the side of my wallet!\n\nSecondly, I love the automatic start/stop digital air pump. So far, I've only seen that at BJ's Wholesale and Sheetz. It's a snap to use and I get the exact tire pressure every time.\n\nAs for service, they seem nice and relatively efficient. The internal layout of the store is the new style that I first saw in Newark. Having separate non-cigarette cashier lines may speed things up in peak periods, although I've never been there during the day, so I wouldn't know.",

I suggest going there with a  group of about 6 people so it doesn't totally break the bank but if you've got the money then who cares! Have fun!\n\nFirst you enter in and select the wine you would like. The staff is helpful and knowledgeable about their stock. (And if for some reason at the end you didn't  finish your bottle they will cork it back up for you to take.) Then select your cheese platter. Lots of yummy stinky cheese to select  from and prosciutto. I wish they had more cured meats but it's all yummy anyway. You pay for the wine and cheese there. Which in a large group one or two people can take care of this  part. \n\nThen going to get a seat can be difficult but just be patient. There's outdoor seating that's very nice and always a live band playing. Inside upstairs is nice as well. Once you're all set with your wine and group it's time to order. Go to the window and play your order. Definite things you must get.... the bacon wrapped dates stuffed with chorizo and the goat cheese and mushroom dish....AMAZING! Although everything I've ever had here is great. \n\nThen just wait for your cheese platter, food and enjoy!",

It really makes it feel homey. This is the kind of place that you think about when you imagine a local diner (at least my opinion of one). Everything I've eaten has been awesome. The service is good and the coffee keeps coming. \n\nThey have a morning breakfast deal between 7 and 830 am. $2.89 for 5 different combinations such as 2 eggs, pancakes and sausage (when you buy a beverage). I might have to start grabbing a little breakfast before work!\n\nSeriously, though.... get the banana pecan pancakes. You can thank me later.",

I usually use the Yellow Pages to find restaurants and judge them by the size of their ads.  Spiro's jumped out at me, not because of the size of their advertisement (small) but Greek food just sounded good to me tonight.  I wasn't disappointed at all.  The Greek lemon soup was excellent and I liked the Moussaka, although the waiter suggested the Sea Bass.  All in all, the dinner was terrific and if I am back in this area, I will head to Spiro's again.  Thanks Neil for the wonderful service!",

Great salsas, relaxed atmosphere, excellent service and price,  Most importantly the burritos are delicious. The chicken and chorizo combo is  my personal favorite but the smoked brisket is great as well. The medium burrito is plenty unless you are training for an eating event.  Family owned, not a chain and it shows in the attention to flavor. Highest recommendation if you are interested in good, healthy food (unless you eat yourself into oblivion) at a reasonable price.",

But it makes up for it by delivering the goods. Awesomely tasty and messy burgers with fresh meat and fixings. The regular fries are delicious... until you try the truffle fries. They are truly outstanding, not greasy and finished with paresan cheese. The metaphorical cherry-on-top was the chocolate milkshake (which actually had no cherry on top). The shake was nothing fancy, but perfectly made, creamy, not too sweet or over-chocolatey. \nIf you want your upscale burger experience but still want your burger-fries-shake holy trinity, come here.",

We waited about 40 minutes, but we had the music and ambience to keep us occupied. \n\nDespite the place being ridiculously busy, our server didn't rush us at all. He encouraged us to take our time browsing the menu and placing our orders- definitely one of the friendliest servers I've encountered. \n\nThe food here was absolutely amazing! The complimentary bread and butter was very nice. My husband and I started off with the seafood gumbo, and it was delicious! Both of us had a sea bass entree and it was definitely the best fish I've ever had. The fish came with a side of green beans and this DELICIOUS sauce that could make anything taste great. We finished off with chocolate orange ice cream and creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e for dessert. The next table over was raving about their bread pudding, so I'm guessing dessert is usually a hit all around at this place. \n\nThe coolest bit about my experience here was that my husband and I got seated where Ronald Reagan sat on his two visits to Mr. B's (far left corner)- Reagan just so happened to visit on my birthday! \n\nOur bill came out to be $100+ but it was worth every penny. If I'm in NOLA again, I'm definitely revisiting Mr. B's.",

Professional but not overbearing or obvious. \n    A little disappointed that they were out of two ingredients for one of their signature cocktails, but it WAS the day before Mardi Gras.\n   The bread and butter at the table was excellent. Crunchy outside, soft inside.\n   The beets salad was so much better and different from similarly named items at other restaurants. The greens literally tasted like they had been picked from a sun warmed field minutes before.\n    G's Choucroute was a meaty fiesta. He loved it. My crab ravioli was lovely with a delicate Meyer lemon sauce. \n    Bread pudding for dessert was just how we like it - sans raisins.\n    Truly a memorable meal.

    "text": "My wife and I had been wanting to go here but just hadn't made it a priority.  \n\nI had the fish and chips.  The batter wasn't thick, and it has a crispiness to it that was a great contrast to the moistness and juiciness of the fish.  I have to admit, when I'm not sure what to get I think of getting a burger or fish & chips, and there weren't any burgers on the dinner menu.  The serving size was 3 cod pieces, approx 4-6 oz, along with a generous serving of fries. Additionally, the tartar sauce appeared to be made in house, had a great flavor.  So, if you're in the mood for fish and chips, I would highly recommend getting them here...because while the serving size isn't as big as Great Basin's, it tastes way better.\n\nMy wife had the salmon tacos, and for the side she had the chicken tortilla soup.  While the tacos had some great flavors the salmon was a bit overcooked, thus making the tacos a bit overshadowed by the soup.  Similar to the fish & chips above, the serving size wasn't large, only 2 tacos, but again, the flavors were very good.\n\nIf you're starving and want a large meal with leftovers I'd recommend other places, but if you want a satisfying meal that's an appropriate size this place is very good.",

However, the atmosphere is great.  It is full of fans of all different sports and the staff is willing to show whatever sport you want to watch on TV.  The service was excellent.

It's exactly what you would expect from a local cafe/coffee shop and then some. The food and coffee were great and the atmosphere was very friendly and casual. The architecture of the dining room was very cool as well - it had a very Victorian feel, which I personally love. The service was a bit slow, but the barista was the only person working behind the counter and she was also very personable, so for that we can forgive her. When I go to a coffee shop I usually go to stay and relax, often reading or sketching. It is the perfect place for that, with both indoor and outdoor tables, a booth, and a counter. I also appreciated the dog-friendly policy but that's definitely a personal preference and isn't right for everyone. The location is also great, being situated in the French quarter. My only complaint is that I could only visit once on my trip to New Orleans.",

Once you try them... you will want to have them again. they are a light cheddar curd, battered and friend. You don't taste grease or batter. the flavor of the cheese is delicious, and so stringy and melty. The sauces are a delicate compliment to the curd. Well worth the splurge.",

There's always something vegetarian, and a plate full of any of it costs five fitty. Add a buck and you can get a split plate of 2 delectable cajun creations with rice. But the best part is the ridiculously awesome garlic bread...which you can get a bowl of for like a buck.\n\nNot only is the food awesome, but the owner (Joe Vuskovich) is a local celebrity. He's a famed restaurateur from New Orleans that sells his secret spice to restaurants everywhere. Everybody in town knows him (despite the fact that there are two other locations) and he's highly supportive of local bands and kids that most older people stay away from.",

We must have looked like a pack of hungry wolves so we told the hostess what had just happened. She seated us right away and sent us two orders of garlic bread (which we later found out were comped!). \n\nWe ordered two pizzas and scarfed it all down. Pi has been consistently good on every visit I have made since I've moved to STL. Service is always excellent. Both the deep dish and thin crust are amazing every time.",

    "text": "After hearing about this place from a fellow Yelp Elite, my SO and I decided to try this place! We were warned of possible waiting times so came here on a Saturday around 10:45, and a line was already forming! \n\nFor apps, we ordered the takoyaki and fried octopus. The takoyaki are delicious-an order comes with 5 balls that were perfectly cooked and topped with sauces. Takoyaki are little circular doughs with squid in the middle, topped with sauces and squid flakes (?). I definitely recommend this app. As for the fried octopus, it was just fried without sauces on top and came with mayo on the side, but it didn't come with enough mayo to dip the octopus in.\n\nFor ramen, I got the red spicy tonkotsu ramen and my SO got the black garlic tonkotsu ramen. For both ramen, the thin noodles were mushy/overcooked and just didn't quite fit with the ramen. That was the flaw with the dishes, and it tasted like the noodles were overcooked in a pot of flour-y water so it wasn't as clean (which explains the mushy feeling). They should use more bouncy noodles for this.\n\nNow let's talk about the broth. The broth is flavorful, but the red chili broth was a bit too spicy for me and covered up the depth of the broth. I prefer the black garlic tonkotsu broth for that reason.\n\nOverall, delicious food and pricing is reasonable. The decor is very nice as well, but screaming kids that were running around didn't make our meal pleasant.",

I chose pumpkin cake flavor which was delicious and smooth. I also got pralines and cream that was better than other praline ice creams. The Tennessee fudge was vanilla with fudge swirled it was good not too special. \n\nThe next time I came I got nutter butter ice cream that was really good had cookie pieces in it! I got the hot fudge topping over it and that was a great combination. \n\nThe service was great the workers were really nice and patient with me haha indecisive! They would joke around with me and let me sample all I wanted. Also no judgement for eating all the brownie sundae alone :) lol",

In doing so,  we knew the wait would be long, which it was (an hour and a half), though i hear there's always a wait. \n\nThe place is buzzing with servers and busboys. The tables around the edges of the room are a bit close to one another,  so seating is tight.  The service was though, considering how busy it was.  I ordered the famed cornmeal pancakes with a side of hash browns and a fried egg.  My girlfriend ordered the banana pancakes with a side of bacon.  Everything was amazing.  The pancakes were hearty but fluffy... The side of bacon only comes with three pieces which is disappointing,  but it was cooked to her liking.  The cornmeal pancakes had just the right amount of everything... Bacon,  peppers... Salsa, sour cream,  syrup... Yes,  all of that.  If you're looking for good coffee,  this is not the place, which was surprising. \n\nThe only question is do you go with the homemade syrup or the maple.... Or both",

He told us the history of the restaurant and gave us some good suggestions. The food was some of the best Italian food I have had in a long time. You can tell everything is made fresh.  The bread was delicious and a new recipe the owner received from his brother who lives in Sicily. We started off with the prosciutto wrapped Shrimp with a yummy sauce. I ordered the Penne Alla Vodka and my boyfriend ordered the traditional spaghetti and meatballs. The sauce in both dishes was excellent! The portions were a decent size with plenty of leftovers for my lunch the next day.  Finally, the cannoli was the best I have ever had! My boyfriend has been to Italy and said it was just as awesome as the ones he tasted there. I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a delicious Italian meal for a good price.

Between the four of us we got the blue cheese stuffed dates, the crawfish egg rolls, steak and cake, lamb sliders, feta fries and fish tacos. Everything was really good,i could have done without the tacos, but the lamb sliders and the steak and cake were AMAZING. The goat cheese paired with the lamb was to die for. And the crab cake was the best I have ever had.",

The wine and cheese bar up front services the live music venue in back. You can pick 3 or more cheeses and they put together a lovely cheese and accoutrements tray for you. You can also choose a wine to open up in the back. Wines have a great selection, mid-range price (almost all winces over $10-20 a bottle).\n\nGreat place to spend the night and have a wonderful time away from the packed tourists hot spots.

Chubby's and Mama's tided me over until I could find suitable replacement.  Thanks to Larry's Steaks, I've rekindled my passion for cheesesteaks.\n\nLarry's Steaks, situated by St. Joe's University, offers the closest thing to the original Dallesandro's cheesesteak I've found.  The meat is sliced and minced into tiny little pieces, maximizing surface area.  Then the cheese is melted throughout so it covers most of the steak and ensures a heavenly consistency and flavor.  The onions and mushrooms are up to snuff as well.  It's greasy enough to slide down your throat but not so much that it's a mess to eat.  I can't attest to the other menu items, but that hardly matters.  If you are up for a real philly cheesesteak, skip pat's and geno's (and the whiz, i can't believe people actually eat that stuff) and pick up a Larry's steak.",

Ask them how they did it and look under the bar. Great food. Different from your standard breakfast food.  Kinda fancy, but not intimidating.  I would highly recommend this restaurant for three reasons: decor, location, and good, creative food for the price.",

Since the wife was craving some crispy duck it came up as having the best reviews for it.\n  Walking in, was a great traditional indian/thai setting with a comfortable small raunt demeanor.  We tried the mussel appetizer, while the wife got the Tamarind Duck and I tried the Panang Curry with calamari.\n  Service was prompt, quick and non invasive.  Mussels were tasty, but the Duck and Curry were to die for!  Portion sizes are definitely reflective of the prices so don't feel like you are going to get gyped.\n  We will be back to at least try the sushi or get more duck seeing as they have at least 2 more styles of it.\n  Happy tastebuds!",

Started with the prosciutto fig arugula Parmesan flatbread appetites. Enough for two people and delicious. Nice mix of flavors. Main dishes were a burger grass fed beef with fries coated with truffles dusting. Burger was humongous!  Looked good smelled good and tasted good. I had a seafood soup with fish ( not sure what it was) shrimp and mollusks in a  coconut/ curry broth. Deliciously spicy but not enough to kill your taste buds. Overall I would recommend this place.

Boy do they deliver, the croissants were buttery, nice and flaky, and melt in your mouth...even better then some of the ones I had in France. Not surprisingly, the baker \"Nico\" is french, and you could taste the difference in the food.  The fact that the products are imported does make a big difference in the taste, it's definitely authentic.  Nico was very personable and friendly, it was fun chatting with an ex-parisian :). The one negative thing is they are too far from me, 45 mins drive, but to satiate my sweet tooth, I will definitely be back! I highly recommend this bakery.",

The fried fish is so flakey and delicious, paired with fresh cabbage, tomatoes, avocado and Sriracha mayo. I have also tried their katsu and curry chicken which are so rich in flavor. Their Thai tea is also on point! So much to offer from a small food truck. I live in Jersey and I have driven here many times just to get food. They are so friendly and provide great food at a great price.",

    "text": "We had dinner here after a long day at the convention center.  We asked to sit in a quieter area, and they found us a nice table in a side room.  Service was attentive and professional.  Our waiter recommended the aged ribeye steak--\"best steak ever.\"  I didn't think I wanted an entire 18-ounce boneless, so he suggested we split it.  We did--certainly one of the \"best steaks ever\"--cooked perfectly medium rare and it was plenty for both of us.  Of course, we also had the signature shrimp cocktail (horseradish) and the iceberg lettuce wedge with crumbled bacon (very pancetta-like).   OK, iceberg wedge isn't the most exciting salad, but it's great when done well, which this was.  \n   My only disappointment was a wine list that had a very limited choice of medium-priced wines by the bottle, so wine selection took a while.  A small complaint, so I would rate H & I  4.5 stars if possible.",

Everything was extremely fresh (I concur on the crisp lettuce) well seasoned and just plain delicious.  A lot of food as well and complimentary baklava. We took our leftovers home (I wrapped the two remaining bites of my gyro - it's that good)\n\nI highly recommend this place and you'll definitely walk out with a smile.

My girlfriend and I always noticed this place was crowded around lunch but never knew why.  After being recommended to try it by a friend, we decided to go ahead and order lunch here.  Cucina Zapata is at the end of the food truck row at the center of Drexel University's campus.  The truck has a graffiti style design which can be easily distinguished from the other food trucks here.\n\nI decided to order (2) thai short rib tacos while my girlfriend got the cap'n crunch tilapia burrito.  The food has a good visual appearance which made us more eager to eat it once we got inside the building.  I really enjoyed the thai short rib tacos even though they put hot sauce on it.  They were definitely better than the typical taco bell food and left me with a 5 star review feeling inside.  My girlfriend also really enjoyed her burrito.\n\nOverall, this food truck provides very good food at a good price.  I recommend this place to anyone looking for a good lunch.",

    "text": "Philadelphia, I love you.  Places like this remind me why.  We sat at the counter and watched the guys make the pizzas.  Our son hates cheese on a pizza and they had one already on the menu for him: The Marinara (oregano, crushed san marzano tomatoes, garlic, olive oil).  It was simple... but delicious. If you like real wood-fired pizzas that char the crust (a little blackened... in a good way), this is the place to go to.  Our other favorite pizza joints that rival this place are Lombardi's (NYC) and Grimaldi's (Brooklyn).  We all had a slice and were shocked at the lovely simplicity of it. Razor thin slices of garlic dotted the fresh tomato sauce.  My husband and I shared the Salsiccia (fennel sausage, roasted fennel, tomato sauce, mozzarella).  Roasted fennel on a pizza?  Brilliant. I cried a little.  No wait... I REALLY cried when we shared this cocktail: The Brooklyn (Dad's Hat rye, Luxardo cherry, white vermouth).  It says it serves one, but they brought it out in a cute little bottle and gave us each a glass...each with a hand- crafted giant square ice cube (hipster-cool) and Luxardo cherries.  Perfection.  We also shared a Rotolo (pizza dough, mortadella, ricotta, pistacchio pesto).  Those are crazy amazing.  I kept saying my husband could eat the rest... then freaking out and going back for another bite. He's lucky I didn't stab him in the hand with a fork to fight over the last bite (to be fair, he was the smart one who ordered it).  I could've eaten several of those and forgotten the pizza (although that was wonderful too!).  We finished with a little dessert... perfect little Italian cookies (\"Cookie Jar\" - pignoli, almond cookies, chocolate biscotti, pistacchio gnocchi) and I got an Affogato (fiordilatte soft serve with a shot of espresso).  The soft serve is Italian sweet cream... decadent and lovely... with rich espresso in a pretty little Italian mug.  I'm in Heaven here.  I know nothing about Vetri's other restaurants, but I'm checking them out next time I'm in Philadelphia!  By the way... service was great and friendly.  5 stars all around!",

We were seated by the window so we got to watch traffic pass by on Canal Street. Our service was quick and our server was great. \n\nOf course I ordered the Grits and Grillades. Slow roasted beef with peppers and onions in a brown gravy over creamy Gouda cheese grits sounded perfect. It did not disappoint as it was so delicious!

The five alarm (which I tried) is the perfect amount of spicy for those of us who crave that extra spicyness in our food. \n\nIf you decide to try it, I doubt you'll be disappointed.",

I heard tables on both sides of us giving the most ridiculous of complaints to our/their server. Both tables were demanding as hell and already said loudly to eachother that they weren't tipping because of x, y and z reasons, and then were dumbfounded that there's a gratuity on their bill (it says it in the menu, anything over $50) their server, smaller girl so with purple hair, carried upwards of 4 plates at once, explained the menu perfectly and had an eagle eye for every table in her section and dealt with ridiculous complaints like a true professional.

I have now sampled most of the menu, but the truly excellent Southern barbecue is what usually calls to me.  You can't go wrong whether you pick the brisket, the ribs, the chicken, the pulled pork or a combo of the above.  Their mac and cheese remains my favorite side, and the addition of the very good coleslaw rounds out the experience.\n\nI love the vibe of Kyber.  It usually pretty full, but they usually seem to have a table available for me (Yay!).  It is often loud, but never quite so loud that I wish it were quieter.  The staff is very knowledgeable, and happy to provide beer recommendations and taste tests of drafts.

    "text": "Thank you Chef John Besh!  My husband and I stayed at the Hilton hotel on St. Charles. One of my main goals was to find some delicious New Orleans grinds.  I was starving when we arrived and didn't want to do any research on Yelp for a place to eat.  Thank God Luke was connected to our hotel!!!  We ended up eating here 3 times over 5 days.  It's usually full of business suits, but that doesn't bother me when the food is so good.\n\nAll the traditional dishes were good, but the huge surprise was the burger.  I was against ordering a burger while I was in New Orleans, because I wanted to try as many local eats as possible... and you can find burgers anywhere.  I overheard this lady raving about how delicious her burger was, so I had to order it the next time we ate there.  She was absolutely right!  It was one of the best burgers I've ever had!  It was huge, juicy, and packed with flavor.  I also highly recommend getting their bread pudding a la mode.  It was mouth-watering good and straight out the oven!",

    "text": "Best meal in New Orleans!!! I was in a group of 4 and we were served by Travis, Susan & Caroline. I had the set price menu: strawberry salad appetiser, chicken entr\u00e9e & chocolate cake dessert. The salad was fresh and a great start. The chicken is the best chicken I have ever eaten anywhere. It had crispy skin, but was the meat was extremely moist and the corn bread stuffing was superb. The cake was yummy, but very rich. One of our party is vegetarian and she LOVED her vegetable selection plate. The other 2 members had the pork with sweet potato mash and said it was excellent. The staff were wonderful and very attentive. Excellent location and definitely the best meal we had in New Orleans.",

Hiro San is absolutely amazing at what he does. His skills are hands down the best and he's also a really great human being to talk to. If you are in the Santa Barbara area looking for a great Sushi experience come here and sit in front of the master, you won't regret it.",

    "text": "Simply put, the Grypon Cafe makes me feel infinite.  It's about two minutes away from the Wayne Starbucks, but believe me when I say that all the cool informed coffee connoisseurs flock to Gryphon Cafe.  Its setting is quiet and intimate.It exudes a chill and serene vibe, from its very dim lighting and small (in a good way!) space.  The lattes are very good- made with strong espresso.  In addition, it provides various baked goods, although I've had a really dry, stale brownie from there (A big no-no! As a result, I don't care too much for the baked goods).  In addition, Gryphon supports a lively local music scene; music begins at 9 p.m. on Fridays and Saturdays.",

I had a salmon scramble with egg whites the first time i went. The second time i went i got the tofu with brown rice breakfast plate. Both meals were great!! And i was seated quickly",

If you have the opportunity always try the boba as well.\n\nThose complaining are just picky and should go back to eating at home.  \n\nTry their beef braised soup as it is hearty and delicious.",

    "text": "This place is so great. I love the laid back atmosphere. Walked right in with our dog and were seating on the cozy wrap around porch outside. We ate here the last morning of our trip and it was the perfect ending. I stayed full long enough to get me through and 8 hour car ride home! I had the bananas foster French toast which was amazing but super rich. I couldn't eat it all because of the portion size and richness. My fianc\u00e9 opted for the healthier choice of a vegetable omelet which was delicious as well. I can't wait to come back here and try something else on the menu. I will definitely try one of their famous juices next time.",
