But while on a dinner meeting and after spending $100 on entr\u00e9es and appetizers, I had to flag down the assistant cook, (the guy in bright red baggy pants watching TV), to see if I could get more avocado for my tuna entr\u00e9e.  He made it very apparent and direct that he could not help me with that situation and I would have to flag down my  waitress so she could bill me for the four dollar avocado.",

Get up and go across the yard to get it. Want a drink, walk up a flight of stairs and pay cash. Want to sit in a dirty yard in dirty lawn chairs, enjoy yourself. The wait staff is mildy helpful in that they bring you your food after you go to the window and pay cash for it...kind of like New Orleans Hamburger and Seafood, but dirty and with live music (which is nice). It's a one in a lifetime experience for me...just once.",

My friend ordered the lasagne and did not like it all. There was only a thin layer of pasta and no flavor. My other friend was still eating her dinner and they cleared her plate when she went to the restroom, after she told the waiter she was not finished. They did bring her a new meal in a doggie bag. The positives are a Great atmosphere and live music. I enjoyed dancing with my husband. However, very expensive for awful food.",

    "text": "Too big, too expensive and too far from Downtown.  \n\nI was here for a conference, which seemed like an awesome idea. It wasn't.  I'm in Direct Sales and (like most people at this conference) don't have tons of extra money to spend on mediocre meals when I'm traveling.  $10 for a slice of generic pizza, small side salad and a soda for lunch.   I understand it's a hotel but there weren't any options close by.  Just getting your car from valet was a hassle and took a lot of time.  Being such a big property, it made getting to restaurants off the property really time intensive.  Since you're so far out of Nashville (out near the airport), the good little holes you find when you're in a city are pretty nonexistent.  \n\nThe property itself was great.  The hotel is HUGE but really pretty.  I enjoyed walking around but was really happy when I found what I didn't know existed...a shortcut between my room and the Convention Center.  It took my 10-15 minute walk down to about 3 minutes!  BONUS!  Like I said, this place is ginormous.  \n\nRoom: Our room was great.  I shared a wonderful suite in the Garden Conservatory with 2 other girls.  We were under a group rate and my friend was quoted $200/night, which is awesome for the space we had.  We had a large room (probably used as a hospitality suite for groups) for socializing.  It had a great bar area set-up and a nice big fridge and lots of drawer space.  Our bedroom was separated by doors that could be locked from either side (like an adjoining room), so it looked like the hospitality suite could be reserved without reserving the room.  It was different than what I was expecting, but whatevs.  It was fine.  So, I wasn't there at check-in.  The girl who reserved the room checked in a couple days earlier than my friend and I.  So, Sunday comes, and the bill was waiting for us when we woke up.  Our friend was charged $1200 for one room (I'm guessing the suite) and $1400 for the other room.  YEP.  She reserved what she thought was a 2 room suite for $200.  The bedroom door was closed when she got there and she asked them to open it up. It was all arranged by the bellman.  She was never told that the bedroom wasn't included....kind of necessary if you're staying over for 6 nights, dontcha think???  So, she's being charged $2600 for what was supposed to be $1200.  Last I heard, the Gaylord's legal department was investigating what she was told, what she wasn't told and if they should charge her the entire amount.  \n\nCheckout:  A FREAKING NIGHTMARE.  Between the money situation, which was not resolved as of late this week, and the 45 minute wait for a cart (in a hotel that holds thousands of people, you'd think they'd be plentiful and they aren't) and a 25 minute wait for the car, my friend and I decided to sweat it out and schlep our goods to the door where our car would be delivered to us.  It was not a short walk and we had a TON of stuff, which meant multiple trips.  UGH.\n\nI'm sure I'll be back for another conference (I am pretty sure my company has booked this for at least one more year....) but I'm not going to be happy about it.  I might even consider driving down, staying in a hotel somewhere downtown and driving out to the Conference stuff.",

The pancakes tasted like a frozen processed version, \"homemade\" maple syrup was watery/sugary with fake flavoring.  Trees make authentic syrup, not people.  The hash browns were greasy and fairly tasteless. The bacon overcooked, hard and chewy.  Obviously had been sitting awhile. Overall, very uninspired food.  Unfortunately, this is one of those places that is living on an outdated \"must go\" reputation.  There are much better offerings in Nashville.",

    "text": "Before I share the main issue, I want to share the reason I give any stars is because of our awesome server, LaToya. She was thoughtful and engaging! \n\nThe black bean burger was dry. Sweet potato fries were good. \n\nToday while at lunch with a group of colleagues the most disturbing thing happened. I noticed the manager in a green sweater lingering around the entrance and then two cop cars with lights flashing pulled up and 3 officers rushed in walked to the table next to us that the manager was pointing to and one of the officer's proceeded to pull out their handcuffs and tell the guy delivering food to put food down at the table and hands behind his back. They escorted him near the front door and had him sit down for a moment before taking him outside in freeZing cold with no jacket where he stood for a few minutes while cops came in and out of restaurant. \n\nThis entire thing was poorly handled, disturbing and unsettling not only to the customers but the other staff. They should have had the cops walk back away from where customers were and deal with it there. Then all the managers disappeared not available to talk to any of the customers let alone apologize or acknowledge people being unsettled. \n\nNo one needs to know why the arrest happened but there needed to be more care for customers and staff in how it was handled. \n\nNot ok!!!",

Only good part about the wrap were the fresh diced cucumber & tomato, too bad that was underneath the icky white sauce that doesn't even deserve to be called tzatziki : (",

She said that they stopped serving food at...... I cant remember if it was 9 or 10 pm.... but she gave me a certain time that the kitchen closed. I went back to my table and looked at the time. It was 10 minutes before the time she told me the kitchen closed. I thought that was kinda dumb, but oh well.... maybe they stopped taking orders 10 minutes ahead or something. The next thing I see the SAME EXACT LADY seat four people RIGHT NEXT to our table and give them menus. Then she takes their order, and brings out their food. All I wanted were some freakin french fries and I had to sit there and watch the people who got there long after me eating french fries instead. RUDE!",

I get there at 6:37 and i expected to wait a couple minutes but not the entire 20 minutes it takes to cook my food. They didn't even start cooking it till i got there. I leave at 7. They did nothing for the inconvenience and still made me pay full. Honestly, I'm so upset with how the whole situation was handled. Where is the customer service??",

Overall, as someone already stated they have great apps but the entrees are left to be desired.\nConsidering each entree costs ~$8, you get what you pay for. I ordered the Pad Thai and it was bad. Way too sweet with no spicy kick to it. We also ordered the Seafood Crispy Noodles, Pearl Noodles, and a Beef rice dish. All were really mediocre. The Indian pancakes and chicken satay apps were great though. Idk why the entrees were so lackluster. I'm sad I didn't enjoy it more but I'm glad the total was cheap for a night out.",

    "text": "My husband son and I went in for dinner last Friday night. Upon entering we were greeted by a friendly hostess. As we stood there waiting for her to grab the menus I couldn't help but to notice a strong dirty mop water stench. Thankfully when we left the entry way it didn't carry into the dining room. The remodel is impressive looking. We were sat at a booth. Looking over the menu I was surprised at how limited it was. As long as you make what you offer well no biggie. I ordered the mushroom swiss burger and a beer. My husband ordered the \"knuckle sandwich\", ( tri-tip sandwich served French dip style). My son ordered the chicken strips and we all got French fries as our side. Jesse, our server was nice enough but in the loud dining room you couldn't hear a word he said. I was more annoyed that he didn't take the initiative to speak up than about the noise. The beer came out, although tasty it wasn't cold enough at all. The food came out within a reasonable amount of time. My husband's \"Knuckle Sandwich\" was delicious! That is what the two stars are for. My burger was shockingly small and probably the blandest burger I have ever eaten. My son's chicken strips tasted like they floured them...and that was it... also, no hint of seasoning. The fries are your run of the mill freezer to fryer. I hope they step it up and are successful.",

    "text": "I really wanted to like this place and heard about it during lent when I had given up meat. I found myself in the area again and decided to give it a try. I usually don't write reviews until I've been to a place a few times but I think my experience was a complete one. I ordered the special and sampled each type of chicken, the modern BBQ sauce, mac&cheese (which the woman behind the counter was very proud of), \na bananas foster pie, and the new hope birch beer. After finishing everything, I just wanted my $16.20 back. Individual reviews: \n\nThe chicken: It was very average and that is being generous. It wasn't incredibly flavorful but it wasn't dry so it could have been worse. \n\nThe sauce: It had the tang of a traditional North Carolina BBQ sauce, mustard and vinegar based. I can't eat mayo so I was limited with sauce choices but the mayo sauces were recommended. \n\nThe mac&cheese: Salty and mediocre. It combines all of the things I like but makes a mess doing it. The pasta was well cooked but the cheese and bacon combo made it taste like I just licked salt off of my hand without the nice shot of tequila after. \n\nThe bananas foster pie: The crust of the pie needs no improvement but the filling could use an overhaul. I use the term filling loosely because after biting into the flakey crust, I struggled to find the bananas. There was a thin layer of smashed bananas and cinnamon sugar at the bottom and 75% of the interior was empty space. \n\nThe new hope soda: The birch beer (the actual name of the soda escapes me at the moment but it is birch beer) was the highlight of my meal. Everything you would expect from a Pennsylvania birch beer and very refreshing, which surprised me because I normally don't like fountain sodas and prefer root beer.\n\nI gave this place 2 stars instead of 1 because nothing was horrible.  I think the concept works, the decor is nice, and the menu is good but they need to work on the quality of their food because it currently doesn't match the cost.",

I would have appreciated it more if the bar tender looked into the off flavor when I sent my beer back. This tells me the bar tender doesn't know beer. I assume that particular draft line needs to be cleaned but maybe the problem was with the keg. \n\nAnother thing that killed me was their use of glassware. They serve beers in the classic American \"Shaker\" pint glass and serve water in the far superior English Nonic Pint glass. I also saw the bar tender pour a white ale with normal ABV in a stemmed tulip glass.\n\nThe shaker pint glasses are kept refrigerated and are too cold in my opinion. I would much rather see them kept at room temp and rinsed in cold water (which they do here). \n\nAll in all, the beer knowledge is not up to par for a place that advertises as a burger joint with a large craft beer selection (30 taps).",

We were there within 20 minutes of ordering and it was ready. But the dining room was empty. For a Sat night that should have been a big clue. The rest of the places in the neighborhood were busy.\nThe steamed dumplings could have been great. The tasted homemade and the filling was good. However, they were so doughy with a really thick wrapper too thick that it detracted from the good filling. Everything else went downhill from there. \nThe beef and broccoli was inedible. The beef had an awful weird texture. Like it was boiled and was gelatinous.  The sauce on it had off flavors. We literally scraped it off our plates and threw the whole thing out.  The meat in both the general Tao's chicken and the orange beef also had weird textures. It was mushy and the coating was thick on those as well. The flavors in the sauces would have been fine, but they were gloopy.  The fried rice was fair but nothing memorable.\nWe won't be going back.",

The Caesar salad was room temperature and overdressed. The hush puppies were flavorless, and the chicken wings (3 full wings is a serving) were undercooked and barely warm. The only redeeming food item was the chicken and biscuits, which had a nice flavor profile- the biscuit was again, cold in spots. \n\nOn the positive side the place has a nice hip atmosphere and the service is friendly. \n\nUnfortunately, the food was so sub par we would not consider dining here again.",

Unfortunately, I just didn't enjoy this restaurant and was pretty disappointed.\n\nLee How Fook is pretty small, but that didn't make it lose any points in my book.  I could see it getting really busy (especially since there are only about 10 tables available), so I would definitely suggest making reservations if you're going on a weekend.  The service wasn't bad, but when I asked some questions about some dishes on the menu, I had a hard time understanding what she was trying to say.  \n\nOkay now to the main course - food!  For appetizers, we ordered the pan seared pork dumplings and sui mai.  Both appetizers were delicious and the dipping sauce was really good.  For the entrees, we ordered the sweet & sour chicken, pan fried noodle with shrimp, and pan fried noodle with beef and black bean sauce.  The sweet & sour chicken was awful - more sweet than sour - and the vegetables in it were really undercooked (pretty much raw).  (I do have to admit that I like things spicy, so maybe this dish just wasn't for me.)  For both pan fried noodle dishes, they were blah with a side of blah.  The beef dish was supposed to be spicy, but I just didn't taste any heat.  I left here full, but unsatisfied.",

Especially Thomas in the meat section.  For these two things I would give them a five.  However, it does downhill from this point on:  ordered one pound of swiss cheese, after standing there waiting for about 5 minutes, and no one else was on line, the unfriendly clerk waited on us. The imported swiss cheese that we ordered was so poorly cut that in two days we had one clump of swiss cheese, rather than many slices.  I bought ricotta cheese for Easter and went to open it, and it was bad, although it was dated 3/28.  The tomatoes on the vine that I bought on Friday were bad by Sunday.  I have found their prices very high, selection, poor and at this point it is just not worth it. I also bought two pound cakes and their were not up to par.  Very dry and tasteless.. Overall a very disappointing shopping trip \nThere is plenty of convenient parking and the store was immaculate, but it is not for me.  The final straw was that I asked for extra cash for Easter gifts, the clerk at the register said there was a $150 limit, the ATM terminal said $100 and the \"manager\" said $50...I thought they should get their act together.

For $2.25 you can order another side our side was coleslaw a little 5oz serving. Make it quick the food had good flavor but all was dry. The BBQ was not smoked that day. Could tell it was all reheated. Sampled all 3 bbq sauces all were good. Also ordered brisket sandwich, they have two sizes ordered the large with a side of chips wanted to sub the chips for a side they told me they don't do that. Sandwich is loaded with beef not sure it was brisket though. Like to see smoke rings on the sliced brisket which I could not see, tasted a little like pot roast .

We put in our dinner orders right away. When she gave us our dishes a few minutes later, she disappeared. We were finished our meals and sitting for 8-10 minutes when she reappeared. By that time, she asked about dessert and tried to go get us a menu but again, we knew we couldn't let her out of our sight without losing her forever. When we placed our orders, we agreed to each other to ask for the check when she dropped the desserts. Of course, she had a runner come to our two top with our desserts. One and a half hours for a dinner/dessert for two (no drinks) in a quiet restaurant is absurd. The food was fine, but not worth the frustration and invisible customer status.",

The fish tacos were decent, but I've had better. \nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/VeFfrEZ4iWaecrQg6Eq4cg?select=-cSzA1ONPpzJcj_GkQ2Eow\n\nThe fish itself didn't have much flavor so most of the taco's taste came from the toppings. I'd try a burrito next time. The beans and rice were fine, but the cheese shreddings on top seemed unmeltable! Throughout the whole meal they maintained their waxy shredded-cheese shape. Ah well!\n\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/VeFfrEZ4iWaecrQg6Eq4cg?select=eLr4PuYuaIF1PUTVGQ8D1A\n\nOverall I thought it was fine, but a littleeee too pricey for the quality.",

    "text": "My fiance and I live in West Chester, which has awesome brunch spots, but we were meeting up with some friends so this was a good middle ground.  This cafe had good reviews, so we figured to give it a shot.  We were seated right away and the menu had a ton of options to choose from.  The food was mediocre breakfast food and affordable, but nothing out of this world.  We probably would have considered to go back if it weren't for the service.  Immediately after our food was brought to our table, the check was placed down, never asking us if we were going to want anything additional.  We sat down at 11:00am, the food came out pretty quickly, but by 12:00pm we were getting kicked out of our seats by the owner.  There were about four open tables for the older women that wanted to sit down, but for some reason it had to be our table.  I could understand if we were holding up the table for hours while there was a line, but there were several open tables and only 5 people (not groups) waiting to be seated.  We were meeting up with friends we had not seen in a while and it was unfortunate to be rushed out after only an hour.  Needless to say, we will not be back!",

I think we saw our waiter a total of 3 times the entire evening. We were never greeted after we were seated. We had to ask the Maitre'd if we could get some water and he could not have been more rude and offended that we had asked. Once we finally ordered, we were out of water. After asking for more water three separate times it finally arrived. And from that point until after we received our food, we never saw our waiter again. I asked the bus boy for another glass of wine which never came. Finally the waiter brought it over after we had finished our meal and when I told him I didn't want it any more, he gave me attitude saying he had just seen the ticket. Not my problem! We were never asked if we wanted dessert, we were just presented the check at which point our waiter told us we didn't need to leave a tip since we were clearly displeased with our experience. As if he was going to get a tip in the first place. Getting tipped requires providing a service which he hardly did. I would say, don't expect a lot from this mediocre Italian place.",

    "text": "After a bad storm temporarily shut down our new-to-us favorite coffee shop Pagoda, I decided to give this spot a try.  Won't be back.  Here's why...\n\nLocation:\nLook, parking in town can be difficult.  That is no different here.  I found a spot nearby but I've talked to others that had to walk quite a ways to get here.  Just luck of the draw.  Beautiful gardens and homes to look at (duh) so just enjoy the stroll.  I'm not applying this towards my overall scoring but I'm noting it so you know that I know that you know what the deal-i-o is.\n\nAtmosphere:\nDead silent.  Seriously.  So.  Freaking.  Quiet.  If you need to study then you've found a winner!  If you want coffee and a chat then you need to move it outside or to another spot.\n\nWhen I walked in everyone looked and stared not because they cared about checking out my style or anything but because I made an actual loud noise and it startled them.\n\nNot the largest coffee shop but seating inside for probably 30 at max capacity?  Chairs and tables not the comfiest nor the biggest. \n\nAfter I got my coffee from the huffy barista (more on that in the next section because I should really review the product & service I got) I chose a spot to read my new cookbook and just tried to enjoy the stillness.  That was great until the guy behind the counter started a very loud and very angry and very loooooong conversation with someone on his cell phone.  In a space that had up until that moment been as quiet as a church, his voice seemed like it was coming out of a loudspeaker.  Look, I'm nosy but I try to make it look like I'm not obviously nosy but it wouldn't have mattered here.  This guy really got into it and wouldn't have noticed if the roof fell in.  He certainly didn't notice the customers standing at the counter waiting long minutes for him to finish what was very obviously a VERY PERSONAL phone call.  After a few minutes I gave up pretending I wasn't watching and took in the show.  After ignoring the customers for a few minutes he finally ended his call, heaved numerous sighs and 'helped' them with the same care he'd given me.  Spoiler alert: it wasn't indifferent but rather seemingly downright rude.  I watched this play out with a steady stream of folks for the next 30 minutes or so and finally left because all of this was stressing me out a bit.  Not really relaxing, ya?\n\nService:\nI asked for a large coffee and was trying to decide if I wanted medium, dark or chicory when it appeared in front of me.  If you don't know what you want in the first 2 seconds then they'll just make up your mind for you.  Okkkkkkk.  I watched this happened to a few of the customers after me too.  This guy wasn't really needing to be dealing with the public because there wasn't obviously other stuff going on that made it difficult for him to his job.  Everyone has a bad day but don't take it out out on the customer to the extreme.  I mean, you don't have to kiss my butt but don't be all huffy and DO NOT PICK MY COFFEE FOR ME WITHOUT ASKING.  Rude.\n\nCoffee:\nIt was good.  Not great.  Not mind-blowing.  Good.  Not as hot as I prefer but more heat than tepid.  I ended up pouring about 1/4 out because I got some grounds in the finish.\n\nI couldn't find spoons and after waiting a moment at the counter to ask (remember, my first time here) and being ignored I just used a straw.  I hate to drink fair-trade coffee that wasn't my choice poured by an angry barista and then throw away plastic when I don't have to.\n\nOther:\nI didn't eat so no word on that.\n\nBathrooms were clean enough.\n\nGreat restaurants nearby.\n\nI really should give the spot 1 star but the cleanliness of the main room, the overall neighborhood area and the outdoor seating bumps it up a notch.  Just know your fair trade coffee can be served with a buttload of snark.",

So I asked the waitress for a recommendation. She recommended the snapper dish. So I ordered that. Then the server came back to tell me the snapper was still frozen solid. The chef recommended I get the red fish but I did not want that. So I got the swordfish.  It was good but I was disappointed.  The waitress was friendly and took good care of us. I said well get me a discount since you didn't have what I wanted. No discount and no manager came out to apologize for not having dishes ready to go for a Friday lunch.

We were told the pizza takes 35-45 minutes to cook and then after asking when it would be ready an hour and a half later were told well it takes over an hour. Then our deep dish supreme was burnt and left a horrible after taste. The manager offered to make something new...didn't have another 2 hours. She did remove the burnt pizza from the ticket but that's it. We never even got our box for our leftovers that were worth taking home. Oh well. I do not recommend this place",

    "text": "It's been quite a while since I've done the college bar thing and quite frankly I wouldn't bother with a review because we've all been there (speaking of the environment) But my friend had a bday party in the private room downstairs. \n\nFirst I appreciated that because we were on a guest list I didn't have to pay a cover, get frisked or have my handbag rummaged through. I was however scared to death to descend the the very steep staircase that led to the private room teetering on my heels. I held the railing for dear life.\n\nOnce downstairs I have to say that I was sorely disappointed with the space. There was absolutely nothing special about it. Just a hodgepodge of tables and chairs, some random booth seats and a bar. No decor, nothing that gave you the specialness of being in a private space. Me and my party pal felt like we had just been shoved into someone's basement. \n\nAlso I was so damn hot I couldn't stay down there. Unlike upstairs where the parameters are all open windows, the basement was cave like. My gf and I made our way back up stairs and nabbed two seats at the bar where we remained for the rest of the night.   Yikes Copa, you can do better.",

It's kinda like any place who has a weird name like that is a red flag but the reviews were so good I figured what the heck. The sashimi I had was a large portion, but the tuna was clearly dyed as it was so red it was nearly purple. I didn't touch the salmon. The bonsai tree roll that is wrapped in cucumber was soggy. The spicy tuna roll was stuffed with filling hardly any rice. The yellowtail roll was pure flakes and no fish. The miso was good though. Fresh and a good amount of miso. I asked for extra ginger, was on the receipt, and received none. So if you want miso check out if you know anything about sushi pass. Delivery was an hour, I was told 20 minutes. The guy on phone had me screaming my order it seemed really busy and he was super rushed. Pass on them.",

    "text": "I tend to prefer local cupcake shops to fancy chains like Sprinkles, but unfortunately I must say that I prefer Sprinkles to The Flying Cupcakes.\nFirst, visually, the frosting-to-cupcake ratio is too small.  I like eating cake with frosting.  I don't want to eat too much of cake without frosting. \nSecond, I'm not a fan of having chocolate chips in my red velvet cake.  They overwhelm the flavor of cream cheese frosting. \nThird, and this is the biggest negative, the frosting does not melt in the mouth!  It's too thick and hard, which means when you eat the cake with the frosting, they do not mash well in the mouth to give the goodness of all the flavors melted together. You might as well eat them separately. \n\nI only tried their red velvet cupcake, and maybe their other flavors are better, but I think I make better cupcakes at home, and I have certainly had much better cupcakes from other stores.  I don't think they are worth my $3 or my time waiting in line.  Their window displays are cute though!",

Since Honeys is one of our favorite places to get brunch, we knew that we would have to wait up to an hour for a table. Since they have such good food, it's worth it.\n\nBut this is why I'm no longer going to go there, and the reason for the two star rating:\n\nThe hostess was horrible. There is only ONE table that can seat up to 8 people. We went in, she told us that the previous party has been sitting there for a while and would be done at any minuet. She also told us that we would be the next people to sit down. We thought, great! since they were putting on their coats and getting ready to leave.\n\nAfter the staff was finished cleaning up the dishes from the table, the host sat down A PARTY OF THREE PEOPLE. that also, CAME AFTER US!!! I just don't get it. There were plenty of other tables available, so why sit a party of 3 at the only table that can comfortably sit 8? \n\nI understand going to Honey's with a party of 7 isnt the smartest idea, but when the hostess tells us that we would be next in line for that large table,and then sits 3 people, that is the dumbest thing ever.\n\nNeedless to say,I am never going there again. They blew it, they lost our business.\n\n\n we left and ate at the foodery on 837 N 2nd St.",

Cold. \n- The food is simply not great. Greasy fried chicken (I realize those two things are synonymous, but you can have great fried chicken that isn't dripping.), and simply generic southern sides. Nothing special about any of it. I would honestly prefer Loveless, Monell's, even Cracker Barrel ....

Wrong. When we entered, we were shuffled over to a seat that was a mile away from the aquarium and told, \"Oh. There are many people with reservations expected.\" Afterwards, an older couple asked the same question about being seated closer to the tank, and their wrinkly old butts were escorted front and center. Ageism at its finest! In the end, my wife and I and the old couple walked away with relatively the same experience though because the food was awful. Don't order fish. You will be treated to a large hunk of dry protein that has no taste and is topped with cranberries. Remember Thanksgiving at Grandma's house? Large overlooked dry as f turkey that you had to choke down with 8 glasses of Sprite? Bingo. Rumfish Grill. I called my grandma immediately afterward and told her that she needed to sue the place for stealing her turkey recipe. She was puzzled since we ordered fish. But y'all know what I'm talking about.",

I really appreciate the lack of added sugars or overuse of ice. However, my first experience far exceeded my most recent visit. The inconsistency in the smoothies makes me hesitant to return. I ordered the same smoothie on both visits. On my second visit, the employee admitted he didn't know how to make all of the menu options; he could definitely use better training. I received a smoothie that likely had all of the listed ingredients, but the proportions of those ingredients were way off. My smoothie only tasted like lemon and celery. It was too sour to finish.

    "text": "Summary: terrible value, unreasonable wait times, extremely inattentive service staff, and perhaps worst of all, smooth jazz. \n\nWhen I read some of the reviews on here, I feel like I must have gone to a different restaurant than everybody else. My experience was not a positive one. Let me first say that my friends are now mad at me for bringing them here. I thought it would be hard to go wrong with a 5-star reviewed restaurant, but I was completely mistaken.\n\nNow, the few positives: the jerk chicken was tasty, and the johnny cakes moreso. The staff was courteous. That's it.\n\nThe staff. We got in at 8, and they came for the drink order at 8:25. We ordered our food at the same time, because we didn't know when we'd see them again. Twice in the next half hour, they came by twice to confirm our orders. Some mix-up. We noticed this happening at other tables around us as well. (Some of) the food arrived at 9:30. We waited for more than an hour for our meals! And two of our side orders were forgotten. Was the restaurant unusually busy? Only 60% of the tables were occupied. The other problem with the servers is that, like the menu, they didn't make clear what came with the meals. If somebody is ordering something that already comes with the meal, the staff would think to tell them, right? No. And if you order a beverage, expect it to be about 80% ice. My friends finished theirs in a few sips. So we had to ask for more beverages, and the staff did not bring any. Finally one friend had to go to their car to get some water. A good 20 minutes later I was able to flag them down, and we finally got more to drink. Everyone was cordial, but ignored us for most of the night. The word amateurish comes to mind.\n\nThe ambience? Well, the dining room is nicely decorated, but too cramped. The gentleman at the table behind me kept ramming into my chair. There was just no room. It also would have been nice if they weren't showing The Walking Dead on the big screen TV in front of me. I don't really want to see stabbings and blood spurting while I'm eating. The biggest problem with the setting, though, was the music. A never-ending procession of smooth jazz played at an uncomfortably high volume. I want to know, who actually enjoys that music? My friend said it felt like being trapped in a dentist's waiting room.\n\nThe food. My friend who ordered beef patties said that they were lousy. And we all agreed that the rice and peas were completely flavorless. It came in a 'bowl' the size of a tea cup. As I mentioned, the jerk chicken was tasty, but the portion laughably small. The large portion meal at Yah Mon is significantly smaller than the regular portion at Jerk Hut. I understand that it's organic, but when you order the large portion, you shouldn't go home hungry. And that's exactly what I did. \n\nThe only reason I'm not giving 1 star is because some of the minuscule portions of food were tasty.\n\nObviously, none of us are going back, and I couldn't recommend Yah Mon to anyone with whom I wanted to stay friends.",

    "text": "I tried Las Cazuelas recently, after hearing pretty good things about the food and atmosphere.  The first day I went in the place was crowded but we were seated promptly and our order was taken right away.  The food came out fast for how many people were there.  However, it lacked any real flavor.  Camarone tacos for me and a seitan dish for my friend.  The seitan was way too salty with no other flavour and the tacos were very bland.  Still hungry, we got the ceviche.  This was the ONLY good thing about our meal.  Water glasses weren't filled at all during the meal, even after the restaurant emptied.\n\nI decided to go back a few days later, to give it another chance.  We had a different server this time, who seemed very new to the business.  Tables who sat after us had their order taken before.  However, again, the food came out fast.  (Wrong order first, but quickly fixed.)  This time I got the veggie enchiladas and my friend got the camarone dish.  Again, VERY disappointed.  Salt and pepper seem to be their only seasonings.  The shrimp had NO flavour, they were very much overcooked.  The sauce on the enchiladas was the same salsa put out on the tables as you are seated.  The veggies on the side of the shrimp meal were the exact same as the ones in the enchiladas.  There is no creativity or thought behind any of these meals.\n\nI will not be going back.  I have had MUCH better Mexican off of the trucks in South Philly.",

The only issue I had was the guy taking my order he needs to be retrained as I asked for my sandwich and for my French Onion soup after that he told me the total without even allow me to get a drink. After giving me my total I asked for a bottle water, he seemed bothered that he had add something else to my order.

    "text": "It is sad but seemingly true that this place has survived for years on the overflow traffic from some of the other places at John's Pass. Tired of the wait at Bubba Gump? Not in the mood for pizza from Delosa's? Just realized that you paid for parking and that Walt'z has closed for the day - plus your feet hurt from a day at the beach ... stop for a while at Sculley's and take what they serve you. If you can find a server, that is. \n\nActually, the service isn't that bad ... the problem is with the layout of the place. The shops here want to have an eclectic air, as though they were built from driftwood and shipping crates held together with sail cloth and rope. This is fine in fantasy, but in reality does not make it easy for the wait staff to get around easily of remain within eye sight of their tables. \n\nThe food is passable, but unexceptional. Being a stone throw away from Gulf of Mexico means that a restaurant can lean towards basic tourist fare (they likely won't know how boring it is) and get away with it. Locals tend to shy away from such places, unless they are entertaining out-of-townees who believe boat drinks and breezes are more important than fine dining.",

    "text": "I agree with some of the other commenters, the place is okay, but not worth the hype it gets. The food is pretty good (appetizers somehow always being the highlight), but it is always SUPER crowded. Like, constantly apologizing to your neighbors for knocking elbows crowded. The tables are very close so that they can fit everyone. This also makes it difficult to carry a conversation\n\nBut the main reason for only 2 stars is the SERVICE! I've come here for lunch about a dozen times and they always push the buffet, which I understand, but they are VISIBLY annoyed when you don't want it. It's so rude! Last time I came here it was with 8 people, and the hostess asked if we were getting the buffet. I told her I didn't think any of us would, so if we could please get menus. Her face immediately changed, she said \"oh...\", and handed me 3 menus...for 8 people. When the waiter came we apologetically asked if we could have some more, and he pretty much had the same reaction! He rolled his eyes while turning to get more, and just dumped them on the table.\n\nSomething similar to this has seriously happened almost every other time! I get that the buffet is easier for them, but come on! It's not asking for anything crazy, just MENUS! At least make an effort to hide it until you get into the kitchen...",

I, on the other hand, ordered a sushi bento box, and the sushi made me incredibly ill. It did not taste bad, but the fact that I got sick made this a 2 star experience for me. I am not new to sushi at all, and frequently get sashimi at other restaurants. This time, however, my stomach is killing me. If you come to this restaurant, make sure you get cooked food.",

I've been here a few times with them and have never been impressed, but after today felt the need to write about it.\n\nUsually when I order a 7-9 dollar cheesesteak I save half for another time so I don't feel like I'm over-eating. When my chicken cheesesteak was put in front of me today I had to ask the waiter if the cook accidentally used only half the normal portion of meat. I've never seen such an empty steak sandwich in my life and easily housed the whole thing, plus the measly pickle spear and miniature bag of chips. \n\nAfter confronting the waiter he asked me if I wanted another and I told him \"no, not if this is the normal portion size. Do they always look so empty?\" I won't quote the waiter exactly but his reply was along the lines of that's the normal portion size but the chef doesn't know what he's doing and that's why it looks small. \n\nThis was a disgrace of a cheesesteak, and thus worthy of a 2 star review considering all the times I've eaten here in the past have been a solid \"Meh\".",

I'm used to Mexican foods from the S.F. bay area...This place does not cut the grade...\n\nHey Reno, what's with the small portions? Maybe due to the war we are engaged in that food is being rationed? Or is business that bad? \n\nCold rice, chicken over cooked and dry (both my G/F's & my dish), my enchiladas was cold, red sauce tasted weird. G/F's flour tortilla was browned in cold grease as it didn't really brown, just sucked up the grease. My soda was flat, not enough carbonation to it....was also warm that the ice melted within 5 minutes of taking it to the table, so soda got watered down...\n\nThe candle center piece in the center of the table was glued down so one has to eat to the side of the table...very strange. \n\nI ordered a burrito and it's not Cali style, it's more a style of what you would find in the freezer section of your supermarket. yea on the small child size. Cali burritos are BIG, plentiful and filling. It also sort of tasted like it was re-heated, not freshly made...I would dine there only as a last resort...",

It's overly priced and doesn't have the best selection and employees are either rude or don't care.  Their pharmacy on the other hand is the total opposite, Don and Brooke and their staff are the most caring people ever and are always on top of everything and will do whatever they can to help anyone who comes up to them. Recently though the store made a bunch of changes. I usually stop on my way home from work late weekday afternoons. You can always bet there's no baskets by the doors and need to go hunt one down in one of the checkout lanes. Shopping carts are always in the parking lot running around crashing into cars on windy days with a mind of their own.  During the summer months the tomatoes in the produce area are a fruit fly breeding ground. They replaced their four self checkout lanes with four staffed express lanes, but they only open one lane during the weekday afternoon peak hours, making the wait four times longer than before. If there was another place to get groceries between the Delaware memorial bridge and woodstown I would surely shop there because anything else would be better than this acme, but there isn't any other choice.",

Waiter says thats not the case but he'd be willing to go to the bar and get for us. Carving station and omelet station was run by one person who was trying not to get overwhelmed. Buffet selection was large but the gravy and clam chowder tasted pretty much the same, as did many of the dishes which was odd.

She brought me a menu, then didn't make eye contact again for 15 minutes!  For a while, the bar was fairly full and I'm not sure why they didn't run 2 bartenders.  There was another waitress going around the room trying to sell shots in plastic cups.  That tells you something, right?  At that point, the game was close to over and I didn't worry about the wings.  Maybe she knew that I didn't need the calories.

We generally get a vegetarian pizza loaded but even with all those veggies, there still isn't much taste.\nWe also generally get a side salad with a dressing (dressings seemed to have come out of a can). But even the salads (lettuce and tomatoes) have no spices on them. This is suppose to be a pizza restaurant. Where are the Italian spices?",

The positive were the prices.  Decent prices.  The hotel does have some cool architecture but it has been neglected.  The place smells musty.  The rooms are nice though.\n\nIt is kind of sad because I see a lot of potential in this place under some good management.  \n\nThe overall negative was the staff.  Every single person we came into contact with was clueless. It feels like they are running on a skeleton staff. You are always waiting and waiting for someone to help you.  The wait-staff in all areas is slow and confuse. The only good waiter was Michael in the restaurant.  He is very nice and professional.  Ask for Michael if you are eating in.  \n\nThe food was not very good either.  The burgers were overcooked and the calamari was greasy.  The steak was weird and rubbery, but the salmon was decent.  \n\nWith the low prices brings a slightly wild crowd.  The pool gets a little wild on the weekends.  \n\nThe spa could be nice, but the massage prices are way too high.  You can go just down the road for something just as good for half the price.  They charged $170 for an 80 minute massage.  That's about as high as it gets.  The massage was decent but you can find cheaper within walking distance.  Nancy gives a decent massage.  \n\nIf I had extra money and time, I would buy this place and whip it into shape because I see so much potential.  Unfortunately, I would not go back unless it was under new management.  By the end of the trip, it was just too much.  The place was dirty and the staff was bad.  We should have stayed home.",

Our waiter Mike was just unprofessional, a tad snooty, and slow.  He has a hard time understanding what customer service is, and he tries to push unwanted items from the menu on you.  Maybe he should pay more attention to his customers instead of relaying heavily on the bussers.  They were great.  They brought the bread, the served the food, they kept the glasses filled, and they picked up the plates.  All Mike did was take our order, disappear during the entire meal, and then make us wait a good 10 minutes to bring the check.   \n\nAs for the food, it was just okay.  It was hot and fresh, but on the bland side.  Neither myself or my friend finished our meals.  \n\nThis place is more show than substance.  There are plenty of other Italian places in this city.

The green corn tamale was solid masa, no cheese or corn in sight. The beef taco was flavorless and the taco shell was soggy and fell apart with the first bite. With an order of average guacamole and chips, my bill was over ten dollars and I had to pick up at the counter and eat out of a styrofoam carry out box. Even their famous tortilla was uninspiring, served in a plastic bag, wrapped around a plastic fork. There are many other places in Tucson for good Mexican food.

I went there recently and ordered coffee, and clearly stated that I wanted it with no sugar.  The girl at the window handed me the coffee, which was loaded with sugar.  I went through again, and asked for what I ordered.  Another employee gave me another coffee, made as I originally ordered, but she made no apology, and seemed annoyed.

First time I've gone to the bar to get a drink and there was no one else waiting, just 2 people sitting at the bar, already served.\n\nThe bartender upon our arrival says she'll be right back - given we were ordering a sauv blanc and an iced tea, could have easily given our order prior to her departure.  She then left for over 10 minutes (during which time a manager or some other employee came behind the bar but made no acknowledgement of us, or attempted to take our order)...and then upon return, did not apologize, but asked if we've decided what we want...well, i decided prior to you leaving, and i sure as hell hope within 10 minutes I'd have decided on one drink!\n\nShe then took the other people who had accumulated's orders prior to serving our solitary glass of wine and one iced tea...and she asked if it was for here or to go, after taking out the glass. I said \"for the balcony,\" (AKA NOT TO GO), and she switched it out with a plastic cup. Given $9.50 for a house sauv is greater than nyc and London pricing (and the cocktails are actually less in most cases), I would say that it could warrant an actual glass, to remain on venue - which we mentioned..and she stated that they were short of glasses given it's \"saint pattys\"...well, I'm sure you have a dishwashing machine. Regardless, she at no point said thank you, and was quite rude throughout, enough so that I truly regret my frequent visits, and one of us complained (about the cup, not the delay and rudeness) to management (however, had I complained, the rudeness would have been my primary issue, not the cup).\n\nTo note, the balcony was 100% empty - for the first time I've ever seen, so no, they were not busy, also evidenced by the lack of patrons at the bar.  Even at the point we left, there were only 2 more couples, whose orders she took prior to serving us, so not exactly a complete rush for which she would be stressed...nor did she go tot the restroom, so not sure where she went for 10+ minutes.  \n\nHaving been a server, and having brought many, many groups here over the years, and visiting multiple times every visit to nola, I found this pretty disappointing.  \n\nThat said, I'll still return, if only for a drink on the balcony, and hope there is a different bartender.",

    "text": "First, I'd give this place another star if I weren't suspicious of my scarf being taken from there after I, through my own accord, left it there one night but it was nowhere to be found when I returned in person 10 hours later to ask about it. \n\nThey claim to serve Mexican and Texas food, on a somewhat authentic basis. This is not true. I've never seen plantains on a taco in a Mexican restaurant in Texas. Also, Texas barbecue is largely smoked brisket served sans bacon in a sandwich. Or taco. Simply having Texas toast and Tequila (albeit a fabulous selection) does not make you an authentic Texas or Mexican food establishment. And plantains certainly don't. \n\nPlus, their customer service hasn't been good after going there three separate times. Each time and shift, the manager has been dismissive and the waiter or waitress has been over-worked. Which is why I wasn't too upset that after 20 minutes of having no ice tea refilled, I wasn't upset when I got attitude from my waitress when I finally saw her to ask. She looks at me and says, \"I was going this way to get his water ('he' didn't ask her a question, 'I' did) and I'm going the other way to get you tea.\"\n\nOk dear, well maybe if you'd checked on us previously you wouldn't be so upset, now would you? \n\nBut above all of this, plantains, though good, are never on a chicken taco and then passed off as \"Mexican\" food. They're good tacos. And that's ok. But poor service is not.",

We waited over an hour (aren't hosts supposed to overestimate wait times, not under?).\n\nThe wait wasn't worth it. For a place that boasts about their homemade breads, it's shocking they don't have better than smuckers jelly packets to pair with their baked goods. The shrimp and grits was good but not great, and the bread served with it was legitimately bad. Dry, crusty, literally just stale slices adorning the plate. My partner got a breakfast burrito - it was meh, nothing special.\n\nI got a juice given their namesake and it tasted like concentrate!!!! It was a special, orange-pineapple-mango. I would not get a juice unless you're looking for a glass of sugar.\n\nBad. Skip. Go to Willa Jean's for a far superior/tastier breakfast experience.",

Unfortunately, this was the case for the Pancake Pantry.  I am a pancake connoisseur and I can usually tell a good pancake by  looking at it. Yes, I'm that good.  One look at these pancakes and I had their number. They were fluffy and doughy, much like the ones at McDonald's or any number of short order diners in the country.  I personally like my pancakes with a light crisp edge, which usually means they have been cooked in butter, and they should be tasty before any butter or syrup is added. Not true of the Pancake Pantry. Just ok. Milquetoast even.  Good bacon though.",

You guys are lucky that I was starving and it was at least another 2 hours before my plane would even start boarding so one slice and drink set me back about 12 bucks.\n\nThe slice that I got was a combo which had sausage, onions, green peppers, and olives. They throw it in the oven for about a minute or two to heat it up. Not the best pizza but i have also had worse. The end crust was pretty thick almost to the point that it was a breadstick. I asked if I could get some pizza sauce on the side to dip it in and was ready to pay because hay, its the airport where they gouge you on pretty much everything. To my surprise, they didnt charge me. I guess nice workers do exist at airports. Unfortunately, this was the only positive highlight. \n\nOverall, I dont think I will eat at this place again any time soon. I can more than afford to lose a few pounds or 20. Put something with actual garlic on the menu and maybe we can talk about dining here.\n\nYelp 2016 Review #12 \"Vampires dont worry about this place. There's no garlic here\"\n585 overall",

    "text": "I wanted to love this place! From the moment I walked in I was impressed. The decor is so comforting. I loved the oversized comfortable furniture. It's a combination of industrial and a beach feel. I loved the appearance of the bar and all of the decorative touches down to the painting of the rest room doors. I loved the different shades of woods used paired with shades of blues and white. It was very spacious and open and the place is much larger then I initially realized. Unfortunately the decor was the best thing about this location.\n\nWe started off with a margarita pizza. There was an excessive amount of flour on the dough. Enough that all 6 of us noticed and tasted it. Our waiter was friendly but unable to make any suggestions about the menu when asked. The servers that brought the food were unpleasant and  just did a drop and run. \n\nI ordered the  huevous ranchos. It was presented in a beautiful manner. There was a strong taste of citrus which I am not a fan of. I was unable to eat the dish and sent it back. Two people ordered shrimp and grits. The grits had no seasoning, had no taste of butter and had a lumpy consistency that we all disliked. Someone ordered the mango chutney grilled cheese. It looked fantastic but his response was that it was blah. We had a child with us who ordered silver dollar pancakes. Instead of smaller kid friendly pancakes 3 larger pancakes were served. Two people ordered the yogurt parfait. It said it was layered with strawberry compote but instead it was fresh strawberries, blueberries and a sprinkling of granola. The oddest food preparation to me was the side of scrapple someone ordered. It came deep fried. I'm a scrapple connoisseur. I have never seen scrapple served like this. It should be on the menu if it isn't going to be prepared as it usually is. It was very crispy but way to greasy and made this scrapple lover pass it onto the next person to try.\n\nI loved the decor of this place enough that I might give it another try. Maybe it was an off day. I certainly hope so because this is a place that has so much potential!",

What a mistake.\n\nFirst off the place is tiny and extremely loud.  I ordered the sea bass, but they were out of it - at 7pm?  Next I tried to order the grouper special - again out of it.  Richard, our waiter told me (confidentially per him) that he could give me the 8 oz lobster tail for $24 along with the mashed potato side and my choice of broccoli or asparagus.  Chose the asparagus.  Chip\nOrdered the Berkshire pork chop with a pepper rub, mashed potatoes and asparagus.  My lobster was good, but no way was this tail 8 oz before cooking.  Chip's pork chop was a spectacle of gristle and fat.  Despite its huge size he probably got about a half portion due to the bad cut of meat.  His potatoes were pretty good. His asparagus were missing, but when he saw the sad little overcooked spears I received, he figured he'd pass.\n\nWhen Richard came back and asked if we wanted a box for the uneaten gristle and fat we told him it wasn't necessary and explained why.  To his credit, he apologized and removed the $15 charge for my glass of Groth Sauvignon Blanc, which we thanked him for and appreciated the gesture.\n\nWhen we got the bill I noticed that I was given an additional charge for the asparagus, even though that was not mentioned when he offered the choice of broccoli or asparagus.\n\nI should say that the house chopped salad, rolls and maple butter were delicious and that's what made me give 1200 two stars instead of one.\n\nAvoid at all costs.  Between the noise factor, lack of listed entrees at 7pm and the bs crap with the vegetable, there are many other places that deserve your tourist dollars more.",

It was our First try so went with the basics: \nchicken quesadilla appetizer, Bacon Cheeseburger and Waffle Fries. \nQuesadilla had no flavor.\nThe burger was way over cooked, dry and flavorless. So sad.  \nHusbands \"Smashy\" burger was overcooked too.\nThe Waffle Fries were OK. Service was good, it was not busy at 7pm on a Saturday probably due to the rain.\nA burger and beer joint with so so burgers\nI really wanted to like it",

We were a small group of 3 and tried a handful of dishes: pulled pork sliders, mac and cheese, cheddar and chorizo fries, BBQ duck wings, aside from the BBQ duck wings everything was just not god, mac and cheese was watery and lacked flavor, fries were boring, sliders were just ok. With so many other restaurants popping up in this area I doubt I\"ll go back and give it a second chance. \n\nI can't say much about the drinks, I think my sister was happy with the manhattan she ordered.

For the worse.  The buffet was not good at all even compared to other buffets.  I think the reason I felt that way immediately was I got 3 buffets and a 25 dollar game card that ended up costing over 50 dollars.  Doesn't sound too bad to get 3 buffets and some games but once you get in and see the buffet and the prices of the games it isn't worth it.  The buffet was only half open and the pizza wasn't hot.  The kids didn't seem to care because they were excited to play games.  Once we finished eating we went to the game area and things got worse.  5 frames of bowling for two kids  = $7!!!  Terrible.  Two go cart rides that was less than 3 minutes = $8.  2 roller coaster rides = $13!!!!!!!!  15 minutes and 25 bucks was gone!  I will say the employees were friendly and smiled.  However, we won't be back simply because for that price there are way better things to do.",

We arrived and chose where we wanted to sit. We were leisurely given menus and a long list of what they DIDN'T have on the menu. \n\nOur orders and our living social voucher were taken. Then there was apparently a problem with our voucher and a lot of back and forth w the waitress. Finally we were told it was ok but the waitress asked us for our order again bc she never put it in once there was a problem w the voucher! \n\nEventually the food came and it was just ok. I got the curry goat. It was mostly bones (large and small) and fat sadly, though the flavor was decent. It came with fried plantains which I love but these tasted like they had been reheated or microwaved or something. My husband got the jerk chicken which was full of little splinter bones. He had to be careful w every bite. He said the flavor was good but very spicy. \n\nI thought the prices seemed high considering the quality of the food and you get served water in disposable plastic cups (yet cloth napkins...). Also, you have to go outside to get to the bathroom which is pretty inconvient when it's raining out. Must be really annoying in the winter!\n\nAnother negative... No street parking in that area. Had to pay for a parking lot next door.\n\nI'm glad I went just to say I have been but I would definitely not go back.",

    "text": "'Have had better' is a pretty good assessment of the place but with a few things to note.\n\nFirst - It's a bar that happens to serve food.  This place is a little dirty but that's part of the atmosphere as noted in another review.  Not roach dirty of course.  So if you're looking for a decent sized bar and bar food then this place is for you.  If you want a decent sit-down meal however...\n\nOur waitress was pretty cute but a little neglectful and forgot my fries and water.  Meh, it's a bar.  When I mentioned it she at least offered to get the fries.\n\nSue K. noted in her review \"Had some high expectations for this place with the reviews I read and the opinions I heard and I ended up highly disappointed. We ordered baby back ribs and there was a good portion but the ribs were dry as anything.\"  I would agree.  I had the babybacks and they were pretty dry.  My partner wasn't thrilled with her sampler platter either so she asked to speak to someone about it.  The manager came over and explained that they cook their ribs to 'have some tug' - meaning that they aren't 'over cooked' as he said and fall off the bone.  So make sure you have some good teeth.  Personally I prefer 'fall off the bone' ribs.  I would also note that there wasn't much taste either.  I wasn't too thrilled with the sauce - which was on the side.\n\nThe owner's girlfriend (Jennifer) came over and wanted to speak with us about our experience.  For this I was really surprised and really appreciated her concern.  The owners at least don't run the place like a bar which is a good thing in my book.  She refunded the full meal and requested we come back so they could make it up to us.  I probably won't go back but I do appreciate the offer.  Looks like it would be a nice local bar though.  The owners are pretty cool and I wish them luck!",

This is the best of the Schnucks in the city itself, although I have to admit that the bar is pretty low right there. The staff is pleasant compared to the staff at any other city Schnucks, which again is not really that hard to accomplish.\n\nThe selection of merchandise could be much better, for instance good luck finding any of the store brand soda in diet, apparently the locals don't care if they are 300+ lbs, as the managers tell me there is no demand for it. The deli is borderline awful and they do a spectacular job of having all of the gristle and fat hidden in the pre-sliced lunchmeat, you figure that out when you get home and you have enough real meat to make a half a sandwich and enough byproduct to feed your cat for several days. Also be sure to check the expiration date on dairy before you buy as I have gotten milk and yogurt home several times to find it days or weeks out of date.\n\nThe weirdest part about this place is the cast of derelicts that loiter there daily yet are not escorted off the premises. To the contrary, they seem welcomed, one even wears a Schnucks jacket in the colder months as he panhandles, sifts half smoked cigarette butts out of the butt disposal out front and shuffles about the store looking creepy. Perhaps characters like this are considered quaint by the locals, but they illustrate why I left for south county back in the day.",

I bought 5 breasts last week to feed the family and there was virtually no meat on them.

Of course like an idiot I thought it was a fluke and bought another breast this week. Same thing. The other pieces are the usual size and quite tasty. I don't know what's going on but I would advise you not to buy the breasts even if you're a fan of white meat. They're the most expensive piece of chicken and not worth it at all.

I called ahead to make reservations and specifically informed them of our anniversary and that every year we dine there as our tradition.   Usually we are offered free champagne and thanked for spending our time with them, but not this year.  Food was terrible and service was even worse. The summer corn salad was the best part of the entire meal.  The mixed grill was awful and not worth the 46 dollars.   The filet and lamb were tasteless and the ribs were a mushy mess of bones with very little meat. The delmonico steak was ok but again not worth the 42 dollars.  I would've loved another drink to try to forget this horrible experience, but the waitress never return after the dinner was served to see how everything was, and if we needed anything.  Overall it was an extremely disappointing experience, from the food to the service.  My wife left hungry, which is unfortunate for the money we spent.  Looks like we'll be looking for a new tradition next year.",

But this order was .... problematic. \n\nListen, they totally got the basics and cheaply too. Pork fried rice, excellent.  Crab Rangoon,  over cooked, but fine. In fact, anything premise and deep fried was exactly as you'd expect.\n\nBut the award winning Whole Chicken Pad Thai is just one giant green pepper disguised as noodles and nuts. It's not just bell peppers -- it's spicy hot, even though it wasn't marked that way -- and they marked half the menu as spicy.\n\nI bought $50 worth of variety and opportunity,  but I'm left wishing I'd stuck to the super boring stuff you can get anywhere.  *sigh*",

    "text": "If you love waiting forever for ice cream in a cup because the employees enjoy standing around talking rather than working then this is your place! I ordered one thing, which I got, then waited several minutes for just a simple ice cream in a cup. 5 employees sat around talking to each other. I get it, working with friends is fun but when there's customers waiting for food, especially simple orders, it needs to be taken care of. Not to mention they brought the wrong thing out, and when I corrected them, I still waited several more minutes for ice cream in a cup. The order taker did apologize for the wait before I ordered but with 5 employees working I'd imagine they could've been able to take an order without waiting for the person up next to leave. I've worked in tons of restaurants before and if it was up to me I'd implement some serious re-training, especially based on similar reviews.",

Waited over an hour to even receive food, my salad was room temperature if not warm. My entree was pretty good, however the rest of my party's food wasn't even cooked properly.

    "text": "Let's start off with the positives, great piano bar great selection of wines and lot's of outside seating. Very friendly staff and bartenders are very attentive to the guests at their rail.\nMoving on...Parking in the area is a challenge small streets don't help either. I understand it is something out of there control but when developing a restaurant your seating calculator is based on parking spots available. This will let you use areas more productively and efficiently. Also it is very confusing where the front door is or where guests are to come in. The signs in the back just make things more confusing. We would have enjoyed sitting outside the weather was not too bad but with properly placed fire pits you could take advantage of all your patio seating.\nOn to the menu, limited but great because of the size of the establishment and very well priced. The selections were good and diverse which is key to satisfying a variety of palettes but...if you offer small a menu everything that comes out should be perfectly cooked and should taste as good as it looks. I had the pork chop unfortunately it was cooked to a med rare. I do like my pork medium but rare is wrong. My wife had the salmon which looked slightly overcooked but she was fine with it. My friend had the bone in rib eye which was cooked well but as far as taste you can tell it was choice grade and lacked a beefy flavor many look for when ordering that cut. His wife had the tilapia and she did not eat it at all! The breading was soggy and tasteless and was non-visually appealing. Too many bland colors on the menu plate presentation is everything! If it looks good it taste good! \nAlso we noticed the menu doesn't offer a description of your sides which this technique is usually used in ala carte menus. I am sure your mashed potatoes are a staple to your menu, but it's important for your chef to check potatoes often through the night because they will brown and become gummy if not maintained right as mine were no good. All of us who received the side of vegi's we received cold and very wilted and over cooked. \nThe last item is we never saw a managers presence we had a food issue and no one came to our table to follow up with us. There was also a table that had children running and screaming which causes safety issues for your staff and the children. If the food runner's were taking food and one of the kids tripped or ran into the runner and hot food were to fall on them or one of the guests it would have been serious.",

There was a party of 2 seated just before us who managed to eat and leave before our entree even arrived! \nThe house salad is large enough for three people! I had the fried mozzarella which was quite good...as were the onion rings. I had the cheesesteak and fries. Again, not bad at all! The bacon cheeseburger was also very good. Though, the bacon is so thick you could never bite into it on the burger. The bacon of the third person with us was as black as the ace of spades!\nSo, to wrap this up, I wouldn't make a special trip again for dinner because of the slowness.

Flavor was nice but it was served icy cold, so the true  flavor could not come through.  The compotes served with the pate were wonderful, a great compliment.  Our entrees were the Steak and Frites and the Braised Lamb with Fresh Herbed Pasta.  The steak was perfectly cooked and well seasoned, the fries were limp and greasy.  The herbed pasta dish was interesting but there were only two tiny pieces of lamb, must have been less than 2 oz of meat in this dish.  Our total bill, with a $40 bottle of wine and two cocktails was over $170.  Poor value for inconsistent food.\nPlease note that our server, Chi, was knowledgeable, efficient and delightful.",

    "text": "THE GOOD: great food for a decent price.  We got the $65 oyster platter which came with 12 huge and succulent oysters, about a dozen each of clams and mussels, 10-12 tails of jumbo shrimp, about half of a huge king crab, 2 small sauce cups of ceviche, and 3 different sauces including a malt vinegar, cocktail sauce, and a spicy mayonnaise dipping sauce, as well as multiple wedges of lemon.  The platter was huge and probably could have fed 3-4 people, though I was able to eat most of it with some help from the fiancee.  The oysters were fresh and delicious and were the star of the platter, while the crab was the not seasoned and somewhat bland compared to the rest of the platter.  Of note, I liked the shrimp as they were steamed with a spicy cajun seasoning which was a nice Louisiana touch.\n\nWe also ordered the fried oyster, bacon, romaine lettuce, and avocado salad which was decent.  The fried oysters on the salad were perfectly prepared, though the bacon was thick cut and a bit on the tough/chewy side (i prefer bacon in a salad to be crispy).\n\nTHE BAD: Service was horrible.  I think we got the worst server in the restaurant; here's the breakdown: His appearance--his long hair made me think he should have been in an 80's hair metal band instead of serving in a moderately upscale seafood restaurant.  His service--inattentive: 1. he never introduced himself before taking our order, 2. he didn't allow us to finish our order as after we ordered our oyster platter he took our menus and walked away and I had to get another waiter/server to order a salad that we wanted to come with our oyster platter, 3.  He forgot our bread, and we didn't realize we were supposed to get bread until halfway through our meal when we saw other tables getting bread, 4. We asked him for lemon with our water and he forgot after multiple queries, and we actually asked 3 different waiter/waitresses/servers for lemon and they all forgot, though our main waiter eventually remembered and brought the lemon to us in the middle of our meal.  The final straw in this terrible haystack was his apathy and rude demeanor at the end of our meal--after taking my credit card and charging for the meal, he walked by our table and threw the credit card/receipt pad so that it plopped on our table and said \"here you go\" and continued walking away like he didn't care.  Overall, it seemed like he did not really care for his job and was there just going through the motions.  I was surprised that a restaurant of Luke's stature hired a waiter like this, as with an appropriate waiter and appropriate service, this meal would have been phenomenal.  Unfortuntely, the service left us in a sour mood despite the quality of the food.  If the service would have matched the food, Luke would have deserved a 4 or 5 stars in my mind, but because of the poor service we received, I gave the restaurant 2/5 stars.",

It has to with the shady business practices of this establishment. We come to this restaurant on a regular basis. My issue is, lately every time we come here they try to price gouge us. Most times when I order a certain menu item, they charge me the lunch price because I order a smaller portion. Depending on the day and the server, the price changes every time. Most recently I ordered only a child's cheese quesadilla, nothing else. I was charged full price for an entire kids meal. I was told when I questioned it that the \"manager\" made him charge me that way. Also on a separate occasion we were way overcharged for margaritas. This issue is now happening so frequently, that I refuse to return. Great job management, trying to get a couple more bucks just lost you loyal customers that frequent your establishment and also recommended it to friends. No more!",

    "text": "TL;DR -- Overpriced \"nickel and diming\" with mediocre cuisine and mediocre service.\n\nOur party of six was attracted to Moto by their ads for \"Moto Mondays\", which is a tasting menu with a  flight of wine for $25.  \n\nUpon being escorted to our table, they stepped on one of my pet peeves which is immediately trying to up-sell us on Pellegrino vs \"tap water\".  We were fine with tap water, which was served European style-- lukewarm with no ice.  Since it was 83 degrees outside with 70% humidity, we found this unsatisfactory and had to request ice.\n\nWhen we asked about the tasting menu, we were told that the serving sizes were very small and we should get something else.  I find it obnoxious that a restaurant advertises a special and then when you get there they try to convince you not to order it!  \"It will never satisfy you!\"  Then why are you selling it!?  If the answer is \"bait and switch\", then it's  a fake deal.  It tells me you don't want repeat business.\n\nEveryone else in my party ordered something else, but I stuck with the tasting menu.  After all, that's why I showed up.  True to the waitress's warning, the three dishes which comprised the tasting menu failed to satisfy.  There was a tiny crudo (raw whitefish with rock salt) paired with a heavy red, a tiny mushroom pizza paired with a sparkling rose, and a thick piece of toast with a thin layer of prosciutto paired with a riesling.  In that order. \n\nThe flight of wine was lower quality, didn't pair well with the  food, and the servings were miserly splashes.\n\nThe crudo was so over-salted that I had a hard time eating it and it made no sense with the red.  I'd just started on the mushroom pizza when the waitress dropped by to ask if everything \"tasted wonderful\".  I said that the mushroom pizza was nice, but that the fish was too salty.  She replied, \"here, we love our food salty\".  I don't think that insulting your guest's palate is a great customer service technique.  \n\nTo sum up, the tasting menu, far from being a chef's calling card, an opportunity to experience something fun and creative, was a half baked and poorly executed marketing exercise-- and a terrible value to boot.    No one else in my party was particularly impressed with their dishes either.  The phrase \"not bad but overpriced\" came up a lot.  I wound up embarrassed that I'd suggested the place.\n\nAs a final insult, Moto's enforces mandatory 20% tipping.\n\nMoto Monday ensured that I won't be back for Tuesday through Sunday.",

We made reservations and upon arrival they sat us at a table near the very back, right by the chef's work table. My husband wanted to sample a beer before ordering drinks and it came warm, at which time he was informed that all the beers would be warm because they were having some kind of issue with the tap system. No big deal but also not ideal. So I ordered the pinot noir on tap and it came chilled?! Which again was fine but weird since the beer was warm.\n\nService wasn't great. The ambiance wasn't ideal. The chef cut the steak right behind us which was loud and they also had a staff meeting right next to us which was just odd and awkward. \n\nThe filet was really good but otherwise the food was only OK. \n\nOverall it wasn't a BAD experience but it just wasn't good either.

Mizu Sushi Bar, off Wash Ave., while not terrible, conforms to this sense of apathy that is killing a once bustling & eccentric area of St. Louis.\n\nFrom a service perspective, we maybe saw our waitress twice throughout our meal here - once to take our order, and another to pick up the bill. The empty chairs & tables during (what should be) a very busy lunch hour added to the poor atmosphere that we experienced. We had contrastingly high hopes for the food, as we were the only people in there, so we expected more care & time put into our meals. Unfortunately, this wasn't the case: my salad floated in a pool of creamy ginger sauce, our sushi rolls fell apart at the slightest touch, and my rice was overcooked & mushy. I'll give kudos to the Mongolian Chicken - it was quite good; well fried & seasoned perfectly.\n\nHowever, there are much better (and less depressing) places to find sushi in St. Louis.

    "text": "Sorry, no.\nHave visited twice, and those visits were months apart.\n\nTrip #1 had fried ravioli app that was quite good and pasta with shrimp that was not.  Way, way garlic heavy and runny, runny sauce.  Hubby had an average burger.  We both remembered it being loud, but we thought maybe still worth a second trip.\n\nTrip #2 they first tried to seat us right in front of the guitar player.  Asked to move upstairs, and still way loud.  Ordered the same fried ravioli app - way overcooked and disappointing.  This time I ordered the Shepherd's Pie, marked as one of their specialties and they are all a pub after all.  Wrong.  Big mistake.  Horrible.  Their Shepherd's Pie is a base of browned meat with something red speckled in (maybe pimentos?), with a huge slab or potatoes that were not creamy, not hot, and not flavorful.  And a HUGE slab.  Beside that there was obviously microwaved broccoli still way chunky and microwaved baby carrots... both absolutely plain except for a brown canned gravy poured over everything.  Gross.  I ate like three bites and lost my appetite and shoved aside.  When the waitress asked if I wanted a box and I said no.... you'd think she'd inquire, right?  No, she did not.\n\nHubby had a burger that was good, but in his words Five Guys a few storefronts up is better.  His steak fries were also good.\n\nWe don't drink beer, and this is clearly a sports and beer lovers place.  We tried, twice, and are done.  No, thank you.",

The waitress didn't introduce herself or any specials and didn't  explain the menu it was just a \"what do you want.\" We guessed and picked a few things, they were good. Then when the bill came she put it on the table and in under a minute came back and picked it up before we even looked at it. Waitress then said \"how are you paying\" I felt awkward because we hadn't pick it up and it was a first date and she put the bill in front of me. I was hoping my date would be chivalrous, and he was but it was uncomfortable with the waitress coming back picking it up and seeing we didn't put a card in the book yet , because we weren't ready and she kept putting the bill back down, in front of me! This happened about three times. In my prior service experience you put the check in the middle, not in front of one person especially the lady of a date. Unsure if I'll go back.",

    "text": "Bully's all have the sports bar theme and they all have a plethora of TV's all playing different sports channels; there really isn't much else to say about the atmosphere but then again atmosphere isn't really why people go to Bully's.  I stopped in with my gal pals to take advantage of their happy hour which includes $3.50 screwdrivers and bloody Mary's, which are massive and not light on the liqueur.  We all ordered off of the happy hour menu which had 16 options for $6 dollars apiece.  Their regular menu is also massive so there is sure to be something to satisfy just about anyone. \n\nWe ordered zucchini sticks and jalapeno popper for appetizers.  There wasn't really anything special about the jalapeno poppers; there was no spice to them at all.  I'm the type that likes my stuff mild but this was no spice at all!  The zucchini sticks were good and I liked the size, they were more like a big French fry size which made them easier to share.  The zucchini wasn't especially impressive but anything deep fried is usually good.\n\n I ordered the beef sliders with a salad.  Two of my girlfriends got the chicken fingers and another got the chicken Philly.  Mine was certainly the best presentation; it was the best part about the meal too.  My sliders were served on Hawaiian rolls which were good but the patties were actually one hamburger patty cut into four pieces which I thought was really lame... If you're going to serve a slider at least make individual patties for it or don't even bother.  The hamburger was also really dry and had to be doused in mayo and ketchup in order to be eaten without choking.  The salad was good.  My girlfriends that got the chicken fingers were happy with them but I could tell that they probably came frozen and all Bully's did was fry them.  The chicken Philly was definitely the least impressive meal; the chicken was left in huge, tough, chunks and there was mention of quite a bit of gristle which is a deal breaker for me.   My friend picked at it a little but ended up eating hardly any of it.\n\nThe service was fine overall; no extra points for great service and no deducts for bad service either.  I would recommend going to Bully's for the great drink specials.  If you are going to get food stick with anything fried; Bully's doesn't get any extra points for being special or unique. The food had a good price but I can't say I would want to pay more than $6.00 for it.\n\nIf you want to see any other places I've reviewed check out my blog at: http://jparkhurst07.wordpress.com/",

    "text": "This was my first time at Cheddar's, and it was not a very good impression. Decor was really nice and we got seated very quickly by the hostess, who looked to be all of 14. Our waitress arrived and that's when it went downhill. Maybe she was new, IDK, but it took her 3 trips to our table before she was ready to take our order. I asked for a beer to be brought with the meal and not beforehand and she assured me that was not a problem. I was wanting a burger but was told sides were extra, so I went with catfish instead. Wanted a kids meal for my grandson and was informed sides for those were extra as well. What next; extra for silverware? There were no crayons or colouring books for kids to keep them busy or child sized utensils either. Anyways, the food came quick and was tasty. Portion size was very good as well. The waitress came back to check on us after about 10 minutes, at which time my wife was able to inform her that the dressing for her salad, which was supposed to be on the side, was non-existent. About 7 minutes later she came back with the oil and vinegar. We were able to finish our meal and then wait another 10 minutes or so for her to ask if we were ready for our check. During that time we we able to watch as one of the male staff came up to the hostess station and was able to give long, lingering full body hugs to the 14yo and 4 others who had gathered at the front door. When he left, the girls continued the hug fest, in between customers coming in. Such love amongst the staff! 8 minutes later the check arrived, but not before 2 other tables had to go up to hug central and ask for their server, too. Going over the bill, at least I didn't get charged for the beer that is still in their tap! Overall, I feel this place is overrated, and it'll probably be quite awhile before I go there again. By the way, if you've happened to live a long life or have served our county, they don't care. Neither senior not military discounts are offered. Bottom line; food was a hit, service was $h!+!",

For those. not from the midwest where breaded tenderloin was originated I'm sure they considered it great. BUT it was breaded with a much-too-garlicky seafood breading, NOT cracker crumbs as that are meant to be. I tasted that breading for hours afterward.  The fries were pretty good, however. The biggest problem is the restaurant was nearly empty and yet it took nearly 30 minutes to get our food.  Our waitress was very friendly but didn't apologize for the delay.",

Overall, should be upping their game big time if they're going to be an off-the-beaten path bar right downtown. Beer selection was decent.

    "text": "So we ordered a New York Strip to share, medium rare.  The waiter, who by the way was outstanding, brings the steak,  it is cut in half length wise making it the thinnest steak I have ever seen in an Outback.  We send it back, out it comes again and delivered by the manager, cut properly but still the thinnest stake we have ever been served at an Outback.  I make this observation to the manager, he ignores what is said and moves on.  The rest of the meal is good.  We decide on splitting a slice of carrot cake, because the portions are always generous, and ask for it to go.,  It was the thinnest slice of cake I think I have ever seen, certainly not worth $5.00.  Compared to other Outbacks, I would guess this one is VERY profitable, as it appears they are controlling costs by thinning portions.",

There is no excuse for a bar/restaurant in this area to turn into what was ostensibly a Giants bar, with only 4 douchebag NYG fans outnumbering Iggles fans in this place. That's really f*ing sad. \n\nI was here for great Phillies playoffs wins this past season, including Halladay's historic no-hitter debut, and it was packed. That was mere weeks ago. What happened in the interim is a mystery, but while I will probably return, you can bet I won't be parking my ass here for future Iggles games. \n\nThankfully, the game turned around and the Gnats fans left with a loss. Still doesn't give this place a pass, though. Two stars. Embrace and support your local roots, G'liff.",

It's as if they purposely decided NOT to clean the sink or toilet. Perhaps management is running a social experiment: to see how long it takes for someone to contract a communicable disease. \n\nI feel that my hands would have been cleaner had I NOT touched the handles on the sink. Just plain gross. I'm getting the dry heaves thinking about it. \n\nMaybe it's time for a bathroom remodel... \n\nAmazing selection of wines. But coming from california I found the markup borderline offensive on the Qupe. $27!?!?! It's a 16 dollar bottle back home. \n\nService was good. Nothing to freak out about. The bartender was a touch surly upstairs, but he made me a mean drink. With tomato and tequila. Sounds weird but it was the highlight of the place. \n\nNext time I'm back in the area I'll definitely come back. But I'm just going to pee on the fence in the corner opposed to touching that filthy restroom. \n\nOh yeah... The Christmas lights are cute and all strung up outside. But take them down inside. It's not a college dorm room people. Management: Keep this place as classy as you can by removing them. It's just tacky. \n\nPro-tip!

Our Waitress, Rita who is amazing, had to make our drink order because the 1-Bartender was backed up. Staffing issues are hurting this place! It makes the experience bad for customers. The staff who are here have to work twice as hard, and still not enough to make the experience worth coming back! And at the end of our dinner, we tried to pay using the little computer that sits on every table. This machine would not accept our payment due to technical issues. The waitress even tried, and the people behind us and across from us had the same issue. The waitress went to get the acting Manager (female with dark hair) who upon having to come out to each table to get our credit cards, huffed and puffed, rolled her eyes, and yanked our credit cards from our hands and headed to the back area to run all payments. She came back and set all bills on each table, rather than hand them to all of us, with no apology, turned and walked away. I can honestly say she does not belong in a people business! Wow is all I can say! Will never be back!!!!!",

Perhaps it is a necessary business model to charge for an extra clean plate upon which to share our items with eachother, but it feels greedy. The food is great. The drinks are great. The service is hit and miss.  We have had some great servers who are attentive, happy, kind, helpful. But we have had some who seem to be too busy hanging out in the bar to be attentive to the dining room. I would give this place 5 stars if not for the poor service at times, and the charge for an extra plate. So if you dont mind some of the servers who seems like they dont care about your needs, and if you dont mind paying a couple of bucks to use an extra plate, then you might like this place.  We have been going for decades, but not so much now that the service is lacking, and the greed(fear) has set in.",

Big waste of money. \n\nNote: I've had a dirty chai here once before, without the nutmeg and with a different barista creating it, and it was truly one of the best I'd had.  The short of it?

    "text": "As the saying goes, first impressions last. After passing by this sushi joint a lot of times, ive finally tried it tonight. It wasnt a really good experience for me. Bad points first before the good. First, maybe because it was a Friday night thats why it took us a while to be seated, not too big of a deal. So I would suggest not coming in on a Friday night. Second, when it comes to ordering food, you must understand that customers who had already waited to be seated are hungry. So better make up on the service. We waited for like 15mins for our orders to be taken (despite the hand wavering- a call for attention). Third, more so another 20 mins or so for our rolls to come out! Hungry turned into Hangry! I appreciated their apology saying the kitchen was behind on orders. The thing is, shouldnt they prepared on a Friday night? Anyway, we ordered 5 rolls. Cant say they're the best cos ive had way better and tastier ones. The place is nice though, spacious and neat. The price of the rolls are good enough.\n\nIn conclusion, service was not exceptional (or maybe its just our server) compared to similar joints and as a sushi lover, there was nothing too special and unique about the rolls.",

There was only one item on the menu that we thought we could eat, a vegetarian ramen bowl.  We asked the waiter if we could get gluten free noodles and he said yes so we ordered two of the same for ourselves.  When the bowls arrived a different server said they were not gluten free as the broth was very cloudy.  The person who took our order neglected to tell us the broth was made with wheat and there was nothing else on the menu she could eat, everything had meat or wheat in it.  My wife rejected the order and I ate mine.  Wife had nothing to eat and had to sit there watching me eat mine. \n \nI find it amazing that in a restaurant that advertises itself as selling Japanese food doesn't have any Japanese dishes without meat or wheat.  Japan is or was a rice based food culture with many dishes without meat or fish.  All I can figure is Raijin thinks all Americans want meat and wheat so they design their menu accordingly.\n\nYoshimatsu restaurant on Campbell Ave. sells many meat and wheat free dishes.  \n\nRaijin is also overpriced for what you get.  Yoshimatsu is cheaper with a lot more variety in the dishes especially ramen dishes.\n\nWe ate a a ramen restaurant in downtown San Diego recently that served vegan and gluten free ramen bowls.\n\nI hope Raijin reads this and changes their menu because my ramen bowl was very good with the added garlic hot mixture I ordered as a side and put into my bowl. I would like to return there and give it another try with my wife.\n\nThere are many, many people out there that don't eat meat and or wheat after all.",

I was in a hurry and didn't want to make a fuss of it, but regardless, when the host came by to ask how the dish was, I mentioned that it was too sugary. He explained that somehow his internet system had gone down when he was sending the instructions to the kitchen. I'll give him the benefit of the doubt, but with only 2 tables occupied in the entire restaurant at the time, perhaps a little more attention to what is happening in the kitchen and how the food is being served would do well.\n\nI'd accept their apology, but to be a great restaurant, you need to look at various aspects of the experience and simply being courteous to guests is only but 2/5ths of task at hand.",

    "text": "Thouroughly disappointed by this one; I litterally starved myself up until 6pm to save every bit of room in my stomach for this night... I stopped at 5 different food trucks only to be met by sup par food and astronomical prices. \n\nMy stops included SAMOSA DEB: $10 for Curry chicken with rice and Samosa - Horrible! Rice was overcooked to the point it was unrecognizable. It was mush. There was no curry. It taste more like a bland Indian dish which I have never had. The spices were there but there was no salt. The dosa was mushy. It was disgusting! \n\nNext stop K-TOWN KOREAN FRIED CHICKEN: $8 for 4 chicken wings supposedly cooked Korean Style. Save your time and your money and go straight to Cafe Soho! The wings were breaded and there was more breading than chicken. What a let down. \n\nThen on to THE COW AND THE CURD: $14 for gloriFRIED cheese and a frozen lemonade. It was a fancier version of a mozzarella stick. Sadly enough this is what I enjoyed the most. What left the bitter tast in my mouth from the visit to this truck? I was with friends from Atlanta who came to Philly for the Night Market so I wanted to share. I asked the OWNER for an extra dish to split the curds and his reply \"NO, WE HAVE NO EXTRA DISHES. TRY USING A NAPKIN.'' As I looked behind him to mounds of extra paper containers. Wow, way to loose a customer buddy. \n\nNow on to RELISH: $8 for Chicken In Waffles, yes people pieces of chicken were chopped up and  infused in the mini waffles, add a pat of maple syrup butter on top, yum yum. Sounds amazing right??? Yeah that's what I was thinking until I bit in to the waffle and my pallet was met by the DISGUSTING taste of DARK MEAT CHICKEN. My entire body quivered as I spit the waffle in to a napkin!  Come on RELISH, you should disclose this as not everyone has the stomach for dark meat...in the trash it went.\n\nI will not be returning to this Night Market! I saw the reviews but I really tried to give this one the benefit of the doubt. We were so disappointed we ended up driving to Jim's Steaks in West Philly to satisfy our food cravings. I will give the one in Chinatown a try in the Fall. My suggestions to my Foodies, avoid this one...",

    "text": "I was expecting greatness and got average. It was an expensive night for average. I would have given them 3 stars for food, 4.5 for beer and 1 for service so that's how I came up with two stars.\nFood. I ordered the Shitaki and Gouda burger with onion straws. It was lacking in mositness and flavor but it was not awful. What saved this meal were the sweet potato fries. They were killer. What killed it was the fact that the order was wrong and I got the wrong fries. The redemption was I tried the regular fries and they were also amazing. \nBeer. I chose to do the 1.75 5 ounce samplers versus the larger beers seeing as I was not sure what I would like. First sample was the raspberry cider. Very sweet, nice good flavor. Not something I could drink more than a 5 ounce sampler but would do again. I also had a Pilsner, the name slips me, it was VERY good. I am a beer wimp and I really enjoyed the flavor.\nService. YIKES. Terrible, awful bad. Appetizers never came. Beers came sporadically. Order was wrong and server threw the kitchen under the bus. I think the kitchen was not the person taking the order.... Not to mention she had an excuse for everything instead of taking the blame. It was a Sunday so it was not even crowded. \nWill I go back...for the addicting sweet potato fries and beer, sure.",

    "text": "Gosh, I'm going against the grain here but I was not impressed. My food was bland, the spring rolls were fishy, the soda chanh was intensely sugared and I left feeling, \"eh.\" We went last Friday and I ate pesce while there. I went with the tofu lemongrass and I seriously wish there was more sauce. It barely covered my tofu which left me eating unsauced noodles. I tried adding a ton of add-ons to try and get some flavor out of the sauce but no dice. The peanut sauce for the shrimp rolls was super watery and again the shrimp tasted old. The soda chanh was crazy sweet. I still enjoyed it but between that and the food I wavered between over-sugared and over-salted. My manpanion had the pho and he gave it an \"eh\" as well. I will say the prices were pretty awesome but I'm not sure we'll be back. There are other Vietnamese restaurants that I would rather frequent, e.g. Far East. FYI - they are now run by the owners of Miss Saigon and I had that very same dish there. It was sauced well and had much more flavor.",

I ate the lobster bisque in a bread bowl and a crab sandwich. The bisque was too tomatoey and I didn't even see and lobster chunks in it, and the bread bowl was NOT fresh. The crab sandwich was decent, but flavorless, you could hardly tell that it was crab. My mother had the lobster roll which was apparently delicious, though ridiculously overpriced at $20. The clam chowder was thick and buttery, and the bread bowl was once again stale. Overall, a very disappointing meal that was insanely overpriced. Such a bummer.",

    "text": "Because of this Panera Bread's proximity to King of Prussia, Costco, and the movie theater, I've been here at least 4 times. Each time, some different person manages to get my order wrong. \n\nDon't get me wrong, I love Panera bread, but the service that this location provides is horrible! The first time I ordered a panini and I stood there for at least 15 minutes before I went up and asked about my order. It turns out, \"it never went through\" (although the charge on my credit card certainly did!) The mistakes made in the second/third orders were also relatively small but irritating to fix. How hard is it to take an order for a salad or a sandwich?? Usually the place is pretty empty too =/\n\nI think the 4th time is the last straw. They messed up the salad that I ordered (I asked them to omit some ingredients because of allergy restrictions) and when I checked the receipt, saw they charged me for \"extra\"!  So I got back in line holding my salad like a huge idiot, and after a 20minute wait (even though there were only 2 customers ahead of me), it took 5 different people another 20minutes to solve the issue. In total I probably spent about 45minutes just waiting to get the right food. They refunded me the \"extras\" charge, but not the cost of the total bill (about $8). I\"m trying not to gripe about 8 bucks, but a 45minute wait is kind of ridiculous.\n\nPassing on this Panera forever =/\nHopefully other Paneras in this area will be better.",

I ordered the chicken cutlet sandwich on a seeded roll but asked for saut\u00e9ed spinach instead of broccoli rabe, which they gave me. Unfortunately, the saut\u00e9ed spinach had no taste and I didn't taste any sharp provolone cheese either (you would have surely tasted it). I had to add garlic powder, red pepper flakes and grated parm cheese so it had some taste. The seeded roll was the winner. As a result of the good reviews of the rice balls I decided to order them. Gross - right in the trash. To all of the New Yorkers who ate here and said it was as good as New York Italian food doesn't know good food from mediocre food. Back to Angelos. Best food around!",

    "text": "I had reservations for two at 6:30 and I was seated right away within two minutes. The atmosphere of this place was nice but that's where most the good stops. \n\nI honestly don't understand how this restaurant got such high reviews. Either people had low expectations or they entered here drunk from an adventure at bourbon st or Frenchmen.\n\nI ordered a river bend and it was made absolutely horrible. It tasted like medicine or as if the vodka was randomly thrown in grape juice and ass. \n\nI ordered a charcuterie board, little neck clams, oysters, Brussel sprouts, and the shrimp grits. The charcuterie board and Brussel sprouts were amAzing. The Brussel sprouts had a seared and sweet vinaigrette flavor. Even though I really prefer the charcuterie sampler at cochon butcher over the charcuterie here it was still good. It came with a rabbit pate which was wonderful.\n\nAs we waited for our clams to come out, the server came to notify us that they were out of clams (thirty minutes later btw). So we ordered a half dozen oysters instead. Those came out within five minutes. However instead of getting a half dozen oysters, we ended up receiving only five oysters on our plate. WTF?!?! We notified our server and he ended up bringing us two additional oysters which was nice, but seriously?! How does a restaurant like this hire people that don't know the basics of counting? That right there made me question the quality of the restaurant and how overhyped this was due to john besh. The oysters were shucked wonderfully but that's really all I can give them credit for.\n\nAnyways, we finished all of our appetizers and waited an incredibly long time for the shrimp and grits. After waiting too long, we canceled our order with another waitress and our server finally came out to tell us that our order was ready but he wanted to wait for us to finish our appetizers to bring out the plate. I don't know of any restaurant that would make you wait an hour for your entree but sure... When the shrimp and grits came out I was honestly disappointed. \n\nI'm sorry to say but this restaurant may be nice but it absolutely does not deserve to be a four star restaurant. If you want good prices, good taste, and service I would go to royal house instead. Otherwise Ya no..... I would never go back here again nor recommend this place to someone else... I am so sad that this place was such a disappointment. Thanks John besh. Left the place hungry. :(",

There's an extreme amount of sauce on every special roll. One roll (can't remember the name of it) was slathered in something that tasted like McDonald's Sweet N Sour sauce - totally killed the roll! Another special roll was covered in an overly sweet white sauce - totally killed the roll, again.",

But here is my problem: FALSE advertising, especially when it comes to their \"specials\". \n\nI went there on a Sunday, and their \"special\" is: Sunday Upgrade the size of your pizza to the next size larger for just 1.99. Obviously you would think that if you ordered a medium pizza for 16.00, getting a large would be 18.00, right? Nope.\n\nWe ordered two medium speciality pizzas and get our bill: Two large pizzas at $22.45 and $20.15, minus $1.42 for each pizza....How exactly am I upgrading for 2.00 and saving any money? Basically they charged you for the price of the large and subtracted $1.42 (why, I still don't know). When I brought it to the attention of the cashier, she said that's just how it is/do it in the system. \n\nI decided to email them, and let them know the above--that was two weeks ago and no response from the restaurant at all. Pretty shady stuff Chuck. Don't think I will be going there again anytime soon.",

The atmosphere is very pretty but waaaaay too tight, and the cakes LOOK very nice...but that is IT! Nothing to write home about. Spent $25 for 2 slices of cake. The whipped frosting has no flavor and my cake was over baked and dry. Expected way more for the cost. Cheesecake Factory, Flying Cupcake, and Classic Cakes are far superior. I'd even rather have spent $19 for a whole sheetcake from Costco...at least their buttercream icing and cake have by far more flavor! Hopefully, the cake quality improves to mach the decor. Then, it would be worth the 5 star price. For $10-12 for 1 slice of cake, you expect to be blown away, not underwhelmed.",

    "text": "Gave Gusto Osteria a second try.  First experience was awful, especially the long wait to get our food from the kitchen.  This time we decided we will not be in a hurry to come back and give it a third try.  Foo foo phooey Italian food and too expense with poor value.  \nCute hostess that greeted us was very friendly, held the door, and seated us immediately.  The service was excellent this time... our dinners came out of the kitchen quickly (although the restaurant was pretty empty except for a large party of 40 for a private affair dining on the patio), our server Jordan was attentive, and the busboy had a great sense of humor and constantly came by to check on us and refill our water glasses, BUT the Alfredo sauce was the worst we've ever had (very disappointing) and the although the homemade sausage was plentiful, just okay if you like Italian sausage (not too spicy... though we would not get it again with Fettuccine Alfredo).  The Cannelloni with chicken had a better tasting sauce, very different for an entree.  BUT overall, the prices on this menu are too high for a la carte or a weekday dinner, and we ordered the least expensive pasta entrees.  Not a vegetable or a small dinner salad are served with the entrees.  No linquini with clam sauce or spaghetti with meatballs, no lasagna, no traditional Italian dishes, and most prices are $15 and up, up, up.  Olive Garden is a much better value with a larger selection of entrees and all the soup or salad you can eat, or even Zona 78 nearby is better (that is probably why they were packed and there was a 45 minute wait for a table).  And the hot bread we were served when we first sat down was just plain weird.... nothing special.  \nThe chef came out of the kitchen to visit with a celebrity diner (Jim Click) for a long time, and when he passed us (the only other diners in the restaurant in that area) on his way back to the kitchen, he did not even acknowledge us, or say hello, or ask if every thing was okay.  Kind of rude.",

Our food was flavorless and when my boyfriend asked why the bbq sauce wasn't cooked in the manager proudly said, \"That's not the Red Hot and Blue way\". He told us how their meat is smoked with nothing on it. So, you get a bunch of flavorless meat on your plate. We both ordered the Five Meat Treat; they gave us plenty of food. Unfortunately it wasn't food that either one of us wanted to eat. The service was fine, just a little slow but our server told us that he was new and he seemed high-school aged; I'm such a sucker for kids who work that I give him a pass. Because the manager knew he wasn't satisfied with the food they took his meal off the check.",

Party of 4 ordered pancakes, eggs and frittata all which were good, problem was the service. Two in our party received their food the other two did not. Nothing worse than half the table getting their food while the others have to wait!!!  Folks w/o food say \" go ahead, don't wait\". In my opinion this is just about the worst thing a restaurant could do to a guest.  Despite the food being good the type of service we received during our visit caused us to have a poor dining experience.  Unfortunately we left the location vowing never to return.  Please 1682 work on this issue, it's important and has a huge impact on the customer experience. Food get 4 stars, service gets 1.",

    "text": "I'm sad to report that Taste of Havana left me a little disappointed. When I heard that a new Cuban place had opened in Indianapolis, I was so excited that I had my wife take me there straight from the airport. (Funny enough, she was picking me up after my trip to Miami, so Cuban food was already on my mind.)\n\nThe Fricase de Pollo (Chicken Fricassee) was just okay. It wasn't particularly flavorful, and the bed of rice it came on was soggy. \n\nWe also ordered a beef pastelito, but got chicken. And while that's obviously not a terrible mistake, the pastelito itself was pretty bad. Much too sweet, and not in a good way. It was a little like those cheap danishes that someone brought to your office a few days ago, and that have just been sitting around since then. \n\nThe cafecito that came with our meal was a nice touch, but ultimately, this also left us pining for Miami. The foamy top was exceptional, and it was beautifully presented in a shot glass that allowed us to watch the foam settle out. But it just didn't have the richness that we were expecting. \n\nIt should also be said that the place was cute and the prices were reasonable. We particularly liked the crocodile-themed wall painting over the front door. \n\nUnderwhelming on a number of levels, and nowhere equal to the hype. \n\nThe Cuban place on Moller and 38th is far superior.",

    "text": "We decided to try this place out, considering that other nearby restaurants nearby such as Lucky Bamboo and Miss Saigon are really good. Plus it was rated high on Yelp. The pho was mediocre at best, and the meatballs and seafood were imitation mystery meats. Not to mention, the service was not much better either. The waitresses seemed like she was trying to rush us out. Plan on bringing cash since they do not accept credit cards. This was my first time visiting, and it's definitely my last. If you want better tasting food with better service visit VN Pho or Miss Saigon.",
