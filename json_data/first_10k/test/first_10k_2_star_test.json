    "text": "A group of six went to The Block a little over five years ago and none of us enjoyed our meal. The amount of salt ruined everything. We knew we wouldn't be going back.\nOver the years, I was told by a number of people how much they liked this place. My husband and I decided to try it again. We thought maybe we had been there on a bad night or perhaps there was a new chef.\nFour of us went this past Sunday. The Ale and Smoked cheddar was good - a good melted cheese with house made pretzels. I found the House-Made Bacon Jam to be too salty, but the other three liked it.\nOur server said the pork chop, the pork and dumplings, and the white wine braised pork were the three most popular entrees. I, fortunately, ordered the burger. The burger was nothing special, but it was fine. I couldn't eat the fries due to the amount of salt on them. My fingers were literally covered in salt after picking up a few fries.\nOne person ordered the white wine braised pork and said it was a little too salty and just didn't taste good. She did like the potatoes and carrots that came with the pork.\nThe other two ordered the pork and dumplings. One ate about a quarter of it and the other a little less than half. It was so salty they couldn't eat any more\nA person, who I believe may have been a manager, came by to see how everything was and we told her. She said most of the spices they use contain salt. She then offered to have different entrees made which we declined - we'd already been there for a little while. They did take one of the orders of pork and dumplings off the bill.\nSince there wasn't a lot of dinner consumed, we did order some ice cream which was just okay. And the salted caramel was, you guessed it, too salty!\nI honestly don't know how people can eat the food here. It's truly the saltiest food I've ever had. That much salt can't be good for anybody! We definitely won't be going back.",

Although the restaurant had only one table filled when we arrived, hostess seated the three of us at a very small table for two, then seated someone right next to us.  She then complained that we were oozing over our table space onto the other people.  Hostess was VERY rude.  Beverages were good, but service was very slow - also odd considering most of the restaurant was empty.  Food was sub-par with tater tots and shrimp being so overcooked that they were inedible.  Pulled BBQ sandwich had so much fat in it it was impossible to eat.  This was such a disappointment since we are big Garces fans and eat often at his other restaurants.  Maybe this was just a bad day for them.",

    "text": "When I found out that a Panera was opening close to my house, I was so excited. I love panera and have for about 10 years, even worked at one when I lived in Florida. However, this location is subpar. I go in the morning and I'd say 9/10, my order is wrong. I don't change anything. I see it on the screen, I see it's on my receipt, but when I get handed the item, it's just not what I ordered. I don't make a big fuss of it, but there are somethings that I can't eat. So I have to turn around and return it. I hate looking at my food in the drive thru but now I have to because it's never right. I know how busy panera can get, so I go at non busy times and yet, I still have an issue with the service. I have tried to give this panera many chances, but I'm not sure I can anymore. This last time, the cashier interrupted me to talk to a coworker and closed the window of the drive thru on me speaking, told me the wrong total, gave me the wrong sandwich, and when I came back, she was adamant that she didn't. Even though I still had the receipt. She said I should just keep the sandwich, I said I couldn't because I can't eat what's on it. Please don't fail me panera! Work on your customer service.",

    "text": "We went to Baileys' Range for the first time this last Wednesday.\n\nThe restaurant has a decent atmosphere. The ceiling has old stuff hanging from it with a modern architectural flare.\nGoing upstairs I noticed the steps were caked in old compact dirt and grime, it reminded me of a set of dorm stairs. It's a pretty old building but they could have refinished it better.\n\nThe bathroom upstairs was in decent condition. But, they hadn't dusted in some time and there was quite a bit of dust caked on the water pipes and top of door frame etc.\n\nWe sat upstairs at a table overlooking the street. Decent view.\n\nWe started off the meal with a pitcher of their \"boozy\" lemonade for 30 something dollars. I can guarantee there wasn't much \"boozy\" in it. Tasted good but order something else if you want something with alcohol in it.\n\nOn to the food.\n\nIt took at least a half hour to get food for 6 people and when we ordered the place was less than half full.\n\nThe Burger meat had flavor but was dry. For $11 for the burger alone I would expect better.\n\nThe Chips and sauces were pretty good but small portions.\n\nOverall a Meh experience. I won't go back and won't recommend the place to anyone else. \n\nIn my opinion, they are trying to be an upscale hip burger joint with small portions with a high price tag but the flavor doesn't live up to the expectation.",

Our Waitress, Rita who is amazing, had to make our drink order because the 1-Bartender was backed up. Staffing issues are hurting this place! It makes the experience bad for customers. The staff who are here have to work twice as hard, and still not enough to make the experience worth coming back! And at the end of our dinner, we tried to pay using the little computer that sits on every table. This machine would not accept our payment due to technical issues. The waitress even tried, and the people behind us and across from us had the same issue. The waitress went to get the acting Manager (female with dark hair) who upon having to come out to each table to get our credit cards, huffed and puffed, rolled her eyes, and yanked our credit cards from our hands and headed to the back area to run all payments. She came back and set all bills on each table, rather than hand them to all of us, with no apology, turned and walked away. I can honestly say she does not belong in a people business! Wow is all I can say! Will never be back!!!!!",

I want to love this place and I think I can if they can be more consistent with their quality!   \n\nI've eaten there twice and both times there was something off about my meal.  First time around I got the peppercorn ranch chicken sandwich with a side of kale.  The sandwich was *almost* good but there was so little ranch that I barely tasted it and my sandwich was rather dry.  The kale was delicious.  I tasted my friend's caesar salad and while the concept was great, it didn't taste like much and was too skimpy on the dressing.  Second time I ordered the classic burger and a side of kale.  The burger was super yummy and there were enough condiments this time but my kale was very badly cooked.  Scorched in some spots but mostly raw with uneven seasoning.  Some bites were super salty and others bland.\n\nI'm wary to go back because I've been so disappointed twice before.  I'm sure I'll try again soon but I'll have to get over my disappointment first.",

Games everywhere, one quarter for the older games, two quarters for the classics, and three for the new games.   Ski ball paid out tickets that would get you cheap prizes, but you could walk out of a night at the arcade with at least a decent sized teddy bear or a bag of whoopee cushions and fake barf.  \n\nAll that in mind, walking into a place that touts an \"arcade\" where a good portion of the games are designed to keep the toddlers happy while the big kids played laser tag, it was disappointing.  I took my 2 year old nephew to a whack a mole style game and I swear to God I hit every damned shark that popped up, giving us a score of 43 and walked away with 2 tickets.  That's BS folks.  B to the S.  \n\nOther games do pay out better, but this arcade is nothing more than a mix of keep the younger kids busy type money pits and false hope \"cut the string for the iPad\" or other versions of the \"crane\" games that one might end up putting $20 into just to get a damned stuffed bear.  \n\nI didn't have a chance to do the laser tag, so I could be missing quite a bit there.  Actually, the kids running around the place did seem to be having a good time.  I just cannot figure out why anyone would go there for anything other than the laser tag.  Bowling looked like any other bowling alley but for prices that aren't even worth spending.  SIUE is just up the road and about half the price.  \n\nIn all, if you have kids, I'm sure Edison's is going to end up on your list of places to go at some point or another, I just would highly encourage you to find a different option.  The games are over priced, with very little reward, and the pizza was good but nothing special.",

    "text": "So I've returned to Muriels on a few trips with groups since my prior review, and it was fine, so no need to change for the better or worse...most recent visit, I'm strongly tempted to leave 1 star as it was so frustrating, but given i haven't written any since 2010 for more positive (but not exceptional) visits, it seems more fair to leave another 2 star one.\n\nMade the mistake of coming in for a drink on the balcony on what happened to be Saint Patricks Day - albeit it was fairly vacant.  First time I've gone to the bar to get a drink and there was no one else waiting, just 2 people sitting at the bar, already served.\n\nThe bartender upon our arrival says she'll be right back - given we were ordering a sauv blanc and an iced tea, could have easily given our order prior to her departure.  She then left for over 10 minutes (during which time a manager or some other employee came behind the bar but made no acknowledgement of us, or attempted to take our order)...and then upon return, did not apologize, but asked if we've decided what we want...well, i decided prior to you leaving, and i sure as hell hope within 10 minutes I'd have decided on one drink!\n\nShe then took the other people who had accumulated's orders prior to serving our solitary glass of wine and one iced tea...and she asked if it was for here or to go, after taking out the glass. I said \"for the balcony,\" (AKA NOT TO GO), and she switched it out with a plastic cup. Given $9.50 for a house sauv is greater than nyc and London pricing (and the cocktails are actually less in most cases), I would say that it could warrant an actual glass, to remain on venue - which we mentioned..and she stated that they were short of glasses given it's \"saint pattys\"...well, I'm sure you have a dishwashing machine. Regardless, she at no point said thank you, and was quite rude throughout, enough so that I truly regret my frequent visits, and one of us complained (about the cup, not the delay and rudeness) to management (however, had I complained, the rudeness would have been my primary issue, not the cup).\n\nTo note, the balcony was 100% empty - for the first time I've ever seen, so no, they were not busy, also evidenced by the lack of patrons at the bar.  Even at the point we left, there were only 2 more couples, whose orders she took prior to serving us, so not exactly a complete rush for which she would be stressed...nor did she go tot the restroom, so not sure where she went for 10+ minutes.  \n\nHaving been a server, and having brought many, many groups here over the years, and visiting multiple times every visit to nola, I found this pretty disappointing.  \n\nThat said, I'll still return, if only for a drink on the balcony, and hope there is a different bartender.",

C'mon yelp!\n\n\nSERVICE:\n-Was good.\n\n\n\nLOCATION:\n-Ocean view, of course!\n\n\n\nFOOD:\n-CLAM CHOWDER: by far one of the worst clam chowder I've had in a while. If you're on a pier and offer clam chowder, you better make it good!! To be fair, I was at Old Fisherman's wharf the weekend before and then I had Pike's Place Chowder up in Seattle within the last year. Did not like the thick chowder texture. It was thick in the wrong way, where it was separating into chunks after 10 mins of eating. The clam taste was not infused very well into the soup either, it was 2 independent flavors from each other. The soup was herb-y flavored, more so than clam flavored.\n\n-CRAB CAKES: the worst crab cake I've ever had! I usually love crab cakes, but this one BARELY tasted like crab. Probably because of all the spice they put into it. If anything it almost had a slight curry taste. For a SEAFOOD restaurant ON a pier, I was expecting nice fresh chunks of sweet crab meat!! NONE of that, the crab was really fine (almost like canned?? texture) and there was absolutely NO sweet crab here, just spice flavoring. I was better off feeding $14 to a seagull.\n\n-FRESH CLAMS IN BROTH: this was the saving grace of the entire meal. The clams were sooo fresh, super sweet and great texture! The broth had a little too much white wine & not enough garlic for my taste. It was also on the salty side, but the clams! OMG, the clams!!! One of the clams was bad though (dead taste) but the rest were fresh.",

    "text": "Let me begin by saying I had high expectations of this place because some foodie friends recommended it. First, they don't take reservations, so be prepared to wait. And wait. And wait. We decided to go there later, thinking we'd avoid a long wait. Wrong! Got there at 8:00 on a Friday night, put our name in, and was told it would be a 45 to 60-minute wait. If you have to wait, make sure you go on a nice evening so you can stand outside...the \"bar\" is more like a walkway/pass through to the dining room. If you can't sit at a table or belly up to the bar, be prepared to be elbowed, stepped on and bumped into every 2 seconds.\n\nWhen we were finally seated 75 minutes later, our bubbly waitress, Ashley, was at our table in just a few minutes. As she tried to share the evening's specials, half of the table couldn't hear because the noise level is DEAFENING!!!!\n\nAppetizers: We started with appetizers...smokey shrimp with grits and cole slaw, and flatbread with herbed goat cheese. I found the shrimp/grits appetizer tasty, while the flatbread was, well, flat. Just goat cheese spread on some plain bread.\n\nThe entrees: being a pescatarian, there weren't many choices for me...trout or the striped bass special. I opted for the trout. While it was quite tasty and cooked properly, it was heavy on the salt. And I am not a fan of salty dishes. Others ordered the pork chop, the ribeye and the bass special. Everyone's comments: it's okay. Just okay.\n\nThe desserts: I am a dessert person. Anything with sugar. Period. But, after perusing the menu, nothing really appealed to me. Which says alot because...did I mention I'm a dessert person? Those that ordered dessert ate their dessert quietly. Draw your own conclusions.\n\nLesson learned: go to a new restaurant with no expectations, just in case.",

Some of the worst service imaginable was rendered despite the fact that at least 6 people seem to work there at all times. The chef was a lonely pimple faced teenager trying to do way more than could be expected of him. \n\nThey were telling people on the phone to wait a up to 2 hours. All this while the staff to patron ratio was at least one to one.\n\nThe pizza was passable, somewhere near the middle of the New York pizza spectrum on terms of quality. \n\nIn short only eat here if you don't care at all to service, because the employees sure don't. Every request is seen as an afront to their busy day of staring into space. \n\nI look forward to this place changing hands again soon.",

But, they don't have a quesadilla on the menu. Once I asked for it, and a couple of employees thought over it, asked each other, and said they could make it, but it will only have meat and cheese, and will cost the same as a burrito! I wasn't willing to pay $7+ for a quesadilla with just a little meat and cheese. Any other toppings would cost extra! Not fair.\nIf you're looking for warm food like quesadilla or fajitas, this is not the right kind of Mexican restaurant for you.\nI also feel that the employee at the register should put in some napkins and utensils in the carry-out bag. I often forget to stop and get some on my way out, because at almost every other restaurant (not Chipotle) they always put some napkins and utensils in.\nOnly once, I got bad service at this restaurant. It was late evening, around 9pm, and the employee preparing my tacos kept talking to another employee the entire time. That is rude, if you are going to talk the entire time, over my food, with your coworker. And, it was just some casual chitchat!",

    "text": "The boyfriend and I went to Samurai Sushi on a Friday night with high hopes as it is a place with 140 reviews that averaged 4 stars.  We learned that Nashville doesn't have a really great sushi restaurant to put bring this very average restaurant back down to earth.\n\nWe recently moved from Orlando so with our first paychecks we thought it'd be adorable to treat ourselves/celebrate new beginnings, etc etc etc.  6 rolls of sushi, a handful of sashimi, and about $70+ later, we were left with the overwhelming feeling of meeehhh.\n\nFirstly, the fish isn't all that fresh and the rolls are over-done.  Whatever happened to just letting the integrity of the ingredients speak for itself?  It's freaking sushi. You don't need to put 10 different things into a roll and then deep fry it and then cover it in eel sauce for it to be delicious.  Some good quality fish and properly prepared rice is really all you need.  Let the quality of the fish be the star of the roll and for the love of god stop deep frying everything.  Generations of Japanese are rolling in their graves.  And what is with this whole strawberry sushi craze?  I thought I'd give it a shot based on Yelp recommendations and 2 weeks on, my stomach still churns at the memory.\n\nIt's not that Samurai is the absolute worst sushi in Nashville (you can go to Ken's for that), it's just that the food as a whole is really really mehhh.  I don't know if it's because TN has to source its fish from the coast and as a result all of its sushi restaurants suck or if its because Samurai just has a really cheap and therefore crappy fish supplier.  Either way, we wont' be back to Samurai.\n\nPros: \n1. the place is cheap.  3 \"fancy\" rolls, 3 normal rolls, about 8 pieces of sashimi, and 2 beers was about $75ish with tip.  \n2. the restaurant is also cleaner than Ken's though that particular standard of cleanliness isn't really tough to beat.\n3. most of the food isn't absolutely disgusting.\n\nCons:\n1. the rolls consist of more ingredients than a Papa John's supreme pizza\n2. the fish isn't really like that fresh.\n3. overall just very average food.",

Upon sitting greeted by one waiter, different one brought drinks, back to first waiter who took appetizer order, back to second waiter who took main meal order, 1st one brought condiments, second one meal. Never knowing who our waiter was resulted in poor service, bread was never brought until we noticed other tables had it and we requested ours. Now down to the food, sooooo underwhelming. We started with the Flamencuche, which they were praised for based on the framed news article when you entered the restaurant. It was compared in the news article to a good pizza, it was terrible, thin flat bread was overwhelmed with an insane amount of onions, its all I could taste. For our meal ordered the burgers, because all the reviews praised Luke's for this. Once again so much carmalized onions and bacon, it made it hard to taste the meat. This place simply was overpriced and under-delivered. Even on their sodas, 3.25 for a small glass bottle soda, ridiculous. So disappointed, didn't even care to see the dessert menu. Mr Besh, I was not impressed would never return.",

I would have appreciated it more if the bar tender looked into the off flavor when I sent my beer back. This tells me the bar tender doesn't know beer. I assume that particular draft line needs to be cleaned but maybe the problem was with the keg. \n\nAnother thing that killed me was their use of glassware. They serve beers in the classic American \"Shaker\" pint glass and serve water in the far superior English Nonic Pint glass. I also saw the bar tender pour a white ale with normal ABV in a stemmed tulip glass.\n\nThe shaker pint glasses are kept refrigerated and are too cold in my opinion. I would much rather see them kept at room temp and rinsed in cold water (which they do here). \n\nAll in all, the beer knowledge is not up to par for a place that advertises as a burger joint with a large craft beer selection (30 taps).",

    "text": "Nice atmosphere and very good service. The menu is very impressive and creates the anticipation of an authentic Italian meal but unfortunately that where it stops. This place is about the same as most places in middle America trying to pretend to be something they are not. \n\nThe food at Moto is incredibly salty and every dish I had was covered in garlic to a point you could not even identify the food you were supposed to be enjoying. It's a sad but true realism that few Italian cooks outside of large cities in the US have the skills and courage to just cook good food with simple ingredients. Great Italian food is so pure to the ingredients and simplicity of the dish and unfortunately most restauranteurs completely miss the mark with bad renditions of simple foods.  \n\nI really wish more people would travel outside the U.S. because they would likely learn that food can be amazing and not just filling.",

    "text": "Meh... this is a suburban bar parked on a city block.  In a lot of suburban bars, people are looking for one thing: a place that serves alcohol.  If you can do that, you have a successful business model.  One thing I prefer about bars in the city is that most need to do more to retain their clientele, which leads to a better bar experience for the patrons.  I think bars are better when personalized, you can find something that is exactly what you are looking for, rather than the same music played incredibly loud at a place without anyone dancing or seemingly listening to the music with the same drinks, the same... everything.\n\nThis is a lowest common denominator bar designed with one purpose in mind: get as many people to come in as possible.   This results in a lack of personality and soul for the bar.  There isn't really anything special about it.",

    "text": "It pains me to write this review since the previous dozen or so times I'my boyfriend and I have been to Tzin for date nights, it was always enjoyable, cozy and the servers really made us feel special, however, this past weekend, my boyfriend and I had our least favourite dining experience there and that really made us both question if we want to return in the near future. \n\nIt's true when they say customer service either makes or breaks an experience. When we first started going to Tzin about two years ago, we were blessed with two excellent servers - Kerrie & Mel... they alone made us want to come back because they made us laugh and were so enthusiastic about the experience and the food. However, about a year ago, Mel left to pursue other endeavours, but we were left in the capable hands of Kerrie (who is also the owner). She has always been friendly, sweet and super pleasant. Re-hired was a former male server from the past. The last few times we've dined there we luckily had Kerrie has our server so my boyfriend and I were happy about that. However, this past Saturday, upon arrival, we were surprised to see that Kerrie was not there, and instead, there was the regular male server from previous times plus another gentleman serving the room. We were greeted promptly and asked if we had reservations (which we did). There were two free tables, for two, at the time - one right near the entrance, and the other in the middle of the room. He immediately pointed to the table right near the entrance for us to sit. We obviously preferred to sit closer inside since it was -30 outside and there isn't much of a barrier between the outside door and inside. I therefore had to ask if we could sit at the other table instead. Instead of agreeing to it, we had to wait until the server asked the other gentleman for permission (which I thought weird since they were both tables for 2). Anyways, that's fine. We got our table in the middle and were seated promptly but missing a menu until my boyfriend had to ask for me. It's around this point that I really started feeling like this date night wasn't going to be the same as others and my boyfriend said he was just thinking the same thing. The server wasn't warm and genuine in his greeting, didn't even ask how we were doing, just wanted to see if we were ready to make our order. Throughout the night, I noticed the same lack of personal attentiveness - for instance, in the past with the girls, usually when the dish is placed on the table, it is described in delicious detail - this time nothing was described except for the three different sauces accompanying the chorizo. Also, our server never once checked up on us after the first few bites, to see how our food was. Incidentally, we ordered three of our favourite dishes and they are all usually very good, but this time round, the potato bravas was seriously lacking in depth - a certain smokiness that we've tasted in the past was not there and all the flavours felt disconjointed like they didn't have time to meld together. The bacon and the chorizo we ordered were very good. All-in-all, my boyfriend and I commented on how cold and inpersonal it felt, even though the space is small and warm. We actually finished our food and drink, didn't linger to have dessert like usual, because that's how disappointed we were with the night's experience. In fact, our date lasted a grand total of 1 hour from start to finish. So much for a lovely evening out.\n\nPlease note, the price for food here is a steep, albeit good, compared to the portion sizes. For instance, we ordered the \"potato bravas\" which was $14.50 for literally two small handfuls of chopped potatoes with bits of bacon, covered in a tomato sauce and topped with green onion. The \"bacon\" dish  was $16 for 3 bite-size pieces of pork belly on crostini. And the \"grilled chorizo sausage\" was $15 for maybe a 20 cm long piece of sausage.",

Everything else I tried was quite terrible. I had the cucumber salad with bits of crab in it, which probably was pre made and refrigerated because the waitress brought it to me immediately after I ordered. I tried some of the rolls, and none of them stood out because they were mediocre except for one that was absolutely horrid: the golden Philadelphia roll. Huge and the beef was covered with rice that was sooo mushy inside the fried exterior. No thanks\n\nNever again",

Wound up here on a Friday afternoon, thanks to Steve Starr having the brilliant idea not to open his beer gardens until 4 PM on Fridays (huh?) for some drinks and light food.\n\nThe beer list is decent and the happy hour margaritas are only $2.50 (which probably is worth a star by itself), but the table-service and the food wrecked the experience.\n\nWe were there for about 4 hours from about 2:30 PM to 6:30 PM - a group of professionals looking for drinks and food with money to spend.  From the time we ordered our first drinks until the time the waitress bothered to come back and check on us was over an hour...we were so thirsty that people were going to the bar by themselves and paying cash...and hungry...we were ready to order food no one in sight, that it was sad.  One of the women with us, who had waitressed in a prior life, actually considered pulling the girl aside and explaining to her how much she was losing in tips.  And it is a tiny dining room and the place was mostly empty until about 5 PM.\n\nThe food barely rose above Chipoltle-quality, although it was relatively inexpensive for Philly.  The guacamole was very spicy, but that didn't mask that the avocados didn't taste fresh at all.  The tomatoes in the salsa were bland and mushy.\n\nWon't be back.",

I think we saw our waiter a total of 3 times the entire evening. We were never greeted after we were seated. We had to ask the Maitre'd if we could get some water and he could not have been more rude and offended that we had asked. Once we finally ordered, we were out of water. After asking for more water three separate times it finally arrived. And from that point until after we received our food, we never saw our waiter again. I asked the bus boy for another glass of wine which never came. Finally the waiter brought it over after we had finished our meal and when I told him I didn't want it any more, he gave me attitude saying he had just seen the ticket. Not my problem! We were never asked if we wanted dessert, we were just presented the check at which point our waiter told us we didn't need to leave a tip since we were clearly displeased with our experience. As if he was going to get a tip in the first place. Getting tipped requires providing a service which he hardly did. I would say, don't expect a lot from this mediocre Italian place.",

In a fine-dining establishment, I expect to get my iced-tea in a stemmed glass, but I expect if I'm paying $3 for that glass that at least it should be made with a tea bag.  \n\nI went with my mom and we both ordered salads.  Both salads had nice portions and fresh and flavorful ingredients.  \n\nIt all goes to heck at the entree.  My companion had the duck.  I had the striped bass.  The menu is somewhat misleading.  The duck was supposed to be served with herbed potato and orange braised endive.  No potato grazed that plate and the duck was on top of what looked like soggy leeks.  The brandy-cherry sauce was more like a savory jus with some cranberries.  \n\nThe bass was good but greasy.  It was on top of what was supposed to be Brussels sprout fondue.  I wish they would have said that it was full of mushrooms and I would not have ordered it.  There were more schrooms then sprouts...bummer.  \n\nWe didn't trust them for dessert, so we scooted out of there.  The whole dinner took less then an hour.  The bill was a few cents over $90.  \n\nOn a positive note, the building and decor are lovely and romantic.  Despite the surroundings, we won't be back.",

The first day I went in the place was crowded but we were seated promptly and our order was taken right away.  The food came out fast for how many people were there.  However, it lacked any real flavor.  Camarone tacos for me and a seitan dish for my friend.  The seitan was way too salty with no other flavour and the tacos were very bland.  Still hungry, we got the ceviche.  This was the ONLY good thing about our meal.  Water glasses weren't filled at all during the meal, even after the restaurant emptied.\n\nI decided to go back a few days later, to give it another chance.  We had a different server this time, who seemed very new to the business.  Tables who sat after us had their order taken before.  However, again, the food came out fast.  (Wrong order first, but quickly fixed.)  This time I got the veggie enchiladas and my friend got the camarone dish.  Again, VERY disappointed.  Salt and pepper seem to be their only seasonings.  The shrimp had NO flavour, they were very much overcooked.  The sauce on the enchiladas was the same salsa put out on the tables as you are seated.  The veggies on the side of the shrimp meal were the exact same as the ones in the enchiladas.  There is no creativity or thought behind any of these meals.\n\nI will not be going back.

    "text": "Barone's has all the right ingredients for the possibility of a successful office party.  The restaurant is divided into several separate spaces, so we were able to get crazy with our annual re-gifting game without annoying the rest of the diners.  The pasta dishes were delicious.  They accommodated requests for gift and wine tables to be set up before we arrived.\n\nUnfortunately, there were far more cons than pros.\n\nBarone's seriously lacks organization and professionalism for large group planning.  When I called to ask about pricing packages, I was told that tax would be waived if we paid in cash.  This meant that the total cost per person fell within my budget goal, and so I went ahead and made a reservation.  A couple weeks later, when I stopped in to choose the menu, I was told that the person I spoke with on the phone was misinformed, and that we would be charged 5% tax rather than 7%.  Since this would raise the cost per person by a dollar, and I was not going to go around asking everyone who had already RSVP'd to give me another dollar, I had to go back the next day to speak with a manager.\n\nI explained my concerns to the manager, hoping that he'd lower the cost of the dinner so that the 5% increase in price wouldn't change my total cost per person.  My main concern was that since my total cost included a tip, the restaurant would take what they were owed, but the servers wouldn't receive their 20% cut.  The manager assured me that it would not be an issue because HE would be the server the evening of our event, and since he understood the situation, he just wouldn't take tip.  \"Seriously, don't worry about it,\" I was assured.\n\nSo the night of the party came, and there were several red flags from the start.  First, the manager was nowhere to be seen.  It would have been nice to be greeted by someone who was familiar with all of my requests upon arrival, perhaps a review of the menu that had been chosen.  But when I got there, the hostess simply pointed me in the direction of the back room and I was on my own.\n\nSaid room happened to be freezing.  I mentioned it to a worker, and was told that the heat was just turned on for that room.  The room never warmed to a comfortable temperature, and I actually had a few diners who ate their entire dinners with their winter coats on.\n\nThe bathroom that was at the back of our room was gross.  It looked like someone had given himself a haircut in there before we arrived, little snips of hair all over the sink, and a canister of hair pomade on the counter.  A friend had to wipe up the sink before the rest of the party arrived.  There were also no paper towels and the room was running low on toilet paper.  It took several requests before these changes were made.\n\nThe service itself was good.  From what I experienced at my own table, drinks and food arrived in a timely manner, and the servers were friendly.  Aside from the pasta course, no one really seemed impressed by their food.  Portions were huge, but taste was forgettable.  The manager finally showed up about halfway through our dinner to ask how we wanted our dessert served, cut up all the cakes for us, and then disappeared again.\n\nMore issues, or maybe the same issue, arrived when it was time to pay.  We were charged for an extra diner; I mistakenly said that we had 31, and that is how many the manager put on our bill, despite the fact that I know he MUST have counted how many plates went out so that he'd be able to tally up our dues later on.  He had to know I had miscounted.\n\nOh, and hey, remember when I was told that gratuity would NOT be included and that the manager would be our server so we shouldn't worry about an inadequate tip?  Yeah, well gratuity WAS included, and we had not collected enough money to meet the total.  I had to ask the poor server (who was NOT the manager) to remove the gratuity from the check so that we could afford the bill, and then I ended up throwing in some extra cash that I (luckily, and uncharacteristically) had in my wallet to come closer to what the total should have been with a 20% tip.  *MAJOR GUILT*\n\nThe manager made an appearance again as we were on our way out, and we pointed to a large bottle of wine that had been opened but not otherwise touched, offering it to him and his servers.  \"Ugh, I don't drink wine.  That stuff is like grape juice,\" he scoffed, as his cell phone rang with some trancey club beats.  Sorry playa.  I'll leave you to your Red Bull and vodka and fist pump my way out the door.  And my coworkers and I will NOT be back for next year's winter soiree.",

    "text": "This place used to be fantastic! But since the smoking ban, the management is acting scared. Perhaps it is a necessary business model to charge for an extra clean plate upon which to share our items with eachother, but it feels greedy. The food is great. The drinks are great. The service is hit and miss.  We have had some great servers who are attentive, happy, kind, helpful. But we have had some who seem to be too busy hanging out in the bar to be attentive to the dining room. I would give this place 5 stars if not for the poor service at times, and the charge for an extra plate. So if you dont mind some of the servers who seems like they dont care about your needs, and if you dont mind paying a couple of bucks to use an extra plate, then you might like this place.  We have been going for decades, but not so much now that the service is lacking, and the greed(fear) has set in.",

I was however scared to death to descend the the very steep staircase that led to the private room teetering on my heels. I held the railing for dear life.\n\nOnce downstairs I have to say that I was sorely disappointed with the space. There was absolutely nothing special about it. Just a hodgepodge of tables and chairs, some random booth seats and a bar. No decor, nothing that gave you the specialness of being in a private space. Me and my party pal felt like we had just been shoved into someone's basement. \n\nAlso I was so damn hot I couldn't stay down there. Unlike upstairs where the parameters are all open windows, the basement was cave like. My gf and I made our way back up stairs and nabbed two seats at the bar where we remained for the rest of the night.   Yikes Copa, you can do better.",

Loved the attempt to really vibe the dining room out with all the wood detail and a food cart...I dig the small dining room vibe (1 smile).  It gives you the feeling that these guys are all about cranking out some killer thai food. Unfortunately the food was really average and took a lot longer than expected.  Ordered the dinner pad kra pao set for $14.95 which included a vegetarian soup (either tom yun or kha) and a dessert.  My dining guest went with the pad thai because their signs say they have to best pad thai.  so bring it...let's check out what the Smiling Elephant can do with this thai food staple.  \n\npad kra was average at best.  not enough basil in my opinion and missed not having green and red peppers.  flavor was really one dimensional...just soy and some sugar.  really needed more basil....soup was decent but wish the serving was a bit larger..as well as my entree.  their pad thai is really just ok...not terrible..not stellar.  def. not the best.  I do appreciate the fact that they use olive oil and no MSG.\n\nBIGGEST GRIPE:  the use of small plates for everything..i feel like this spot if trying to use tiny, square plates to try to be hip.  the small size of the dishes made it impossible to enjoy my meal.  food kept falling off the sides...I couldn't mix my fried egg over the rice...I had to ask for a large bowl.\n\nI recommend not going with the dinner set...it's just not worth it.  you barely get any soup and the dessert is a joke.  it's one bites worth of coconut custard which really is just a bunch of tapioca starch.  \n\nour server was friendly and attentive!

They stuck with the bare minimum of talking with customers. \"what can I get for you.\"  But then shortly after the staff started talking about personal stuff I front of customers.

So poor we had to constantly get up and ask another person for things like refills, the check, to go boxes.

    "text": "I came again tonight for \"margarita madness\". It has been over a year since my last visit. I only went because a friend who was visiting from out of town wanted to go. Also, $1 tacos and $2.30 margaritas may have pulled me in as well. We arrived at 8 and waited 25 minutes and we still had not been asked for our drink order. We decided to go inside to the bar to order our margaritas. In all fairness they were extremely busy, even out on the patio where we sat. But still 25 minutes for drinks seemed extreme. Since we had so much time to sit around, I had plenty of time to observe the environment. The chairs outside are hard metal chairs with open slats on the bottom that are just not comfortable at all. The overhang above the patio was kind of grody looking. Overall our server was nice, probably just overworked. After we got our drinks, our table of 8 ordered a ton of the beef or refried bean tacos. They just had lettuce and cheese on top, but not bad for the price. The chips and salsa was still just \"meh\". Nothing impressive. I've had better salsa from a jar. The server did bring out the tacos much quicker than the drinks, but still the whole experience took forever\n\nInside, while waiting at the bar for drinks, I noticed yet again that the live band was extremely loud, far too loud for a Monday night restaurant crowd. At that point I was glad we sat outside\n\nBased on this visit I'd probably give 2.5 stars, but I'm still not totally sold on Poblanos",

    "text": "I was really looking forward to Luke, but ended up leaving disappointed. I had heard such good things so my husband and I came to dinner on a Monday night. We were seated at a table backing up to the bar, which wasn't ideal but we dealt with it. We had two servers who were friendly enough, but for some reason just seemed very overwhelmed and unable to handle the tables they had. I had a bubbly to start and my husband had a beer. Both were fine but not special. I moved to a red wine for my meal, and it wasn't very good, especially not for the price point.\n\nTo start my husband got the stuffed oysters with shrimp and blue crab. They were very bready and underwhelming. The only crab to be found was small slivers. For our mains I had a shrimp, crab, and cavatelli \u00e9touff\u00e9e. I expected more of a shrimp dish with some pasta underneath, but it was more like a pasta dish with minimal seafood. The shrimp was small and tasted like typical frozen shrimp. Like the appetizer, there wasn't really any real crab meat, just small sliver here and there. The pasta was fine but felt a tad overcooked. It honestly tasted like a pasta dish I could make quickly at home. And for around $26, that's ridiculous. My husband had the jumbo Louisiana shrimp with jalape\u00f1o grits. Luckily, his shrimp were large and flavorful. But the rest of the dish fell flat. The grits had very little flavor. \n\nToward the end of our meal a very large group came into the bar, it almost seemed like a post-wedding thing. They were very rude and kept backing into not only our chairs and table, but the people around us as well. A lot of us were getting frustrated and the staff couldn't have cared less. They did nothing to remedy the situation. We left as quickly as we could. All in all, the food was mediocre and this place felt like a tourist trap, which I hadn't been expecting. I'd go elsewhere while in New Orleans.",

We did have attentive and engaging wait staff but I just expected more. \n\nOur first try at Luke was for dinner on my birthday... My Etouffee was great, my date's steak was over cooked and possibly expedited wrong, as it took mere seconds for them to return with a medium rare steak. Unfortunately it came back out over salted but he opted not to send it back again (I don't blame him). \n\nI really wanted the bread pudding with pecan sauce just didn't have room, so ordered it via room service the next night and again was under whelmed again, it arrived only slightly warm with the ice cream completely melted (they were in separate containers). \n\nOn our last day in town (Friday) we wanted to give it one more shot since it wasn't Mardi Gras and life seemed to be returning to normal... court-bouillon was okay, however the chicken on my salade de poulet grille, was almost raw, that's right, barely cooked chicken on my plate!

If you're in the area, there arent' many other options for what they are offering but on the whole, I found my experience lackluster.\n\nThe food here is the equivalent of 90s applebees.  Tons of fried items and not a ton of care given to things coming from the kitchen.  Presentation is really not a part of their food program and I don't think the customers care very much.\n\nAs far as the bar goes, their selection is good for the area but that's where the good stops.  The bar staff in my experience didn't care about the beer they were serving.  Glasses were ice cold and the bartender who served us was high.  If they let their employees show up intoxicated, inebriated or under the influence, well that just gives you a glimpse into how the place is run.\n\nMaybe a Sunday is not the best time to visit but for my money, I think I'll head to other places.",

    "text": "I want to say that this a review specifically about the Plymouth Meeting Cracker Barrel.  My boyfriend, my parents and my sister and her family have all been to many other Cracker Barrel's and they all raved about their experiences.  This is not a rave review.\n\nSunday morning around 9:30am on our way to vacation, my boyfriend thought I should experience Cracker Barrel.  I had heard wonderful things from family and friends so I was excited.  The one in Plymouth Meeting was on the way to our destination so we stopped there.  The gift shop is pretty spectacular and well priced but I am trying to lose weight so purchasing candy was not on the to-do list.  Very fun to look around at all the old time candies though!\n\nWe were seated very quickly and our waitress came over relatively quickly to give us water.  She smiled once, briefly and then turned into a robot.  I ordered Mama's French Toast Breakfast and asked for the meat on a separate plate since I am a vegetarian and wanted to give my boyfriend the meat.  This confused her I guess because it did not compute and took her some time to process.  My boyfriend ordered Mama's Pancake breakfast, eggs lightly scrambled.  \n\nAnd then we waited.  And waited.  And waited.  People who were seated after us got served well before us by nicer, more caring waitresses around the room.  \n\nWhen we finally got our food, it was lukewarm.  The french toast was bland and tasted like uncooked white bread.  They switched the egg orders so I got the lightly scrambled ones and before I realized it had added ketchup so then my boyfriend wouldn't eat it and I had slimy eggs while his were scrambled hard.  The pancakes were burnt and tough.\n\nWe were both thoroughly disappointed in this experience and will not return to this CB although I am still open to trying other ones in other parts of the country.",

Adore being treated like an annoyance by a bartender? \n\nYou'll LOVE Parilla!\n\nI can't think of a restaurant with worse service in Boise. We all go here for the convenience and the price, not for the food or the service. Some of the burrito flavor combinations are tasty (especially the Asian ones), but often the rice and/or the meat are overcooked and dry. The $2 tacos are a good deal...until you remember that you can get a far better taco and be treated with courtesy at a taco truck downtown. But you're hungry and you're tired from your ride and you live nearby, so, in your delerium, you decide it's worth the abuse to support this mediocre business.\n\nThis weekend I flagged down the bartender after being ignored for a few minutes and he said \"I was having a conversation.\" I asked about the specials and he mumbled something about the house bloody mary being $6 and some other bloody being $3. Being a bit broke at the moment, I ordered two $3 bloodies and he pushed two glasses at me. They were filled with ice and some vodka in the bottom. \"I'm sorry? Did I miss something?\" I asked. He jerked a thumb around the corner, and I noticed a couple shelves with bloody mary mix, hot sauces and spices: a bloody mary bar! I save $3 by making my own, and I get the added benefit of not being treated like a mosquito. \n\nIn case you doubt the surly non-service is not intentional, check out the rules they have posted in the bar.

    "text": "I'm sad to report that Taste of Havana left me a little disappointed. When I heard that a new Cuban place had opened in Indianapolis, I was so excited that I had my wife take me there straight from the airport. (Funny enough, she was picking me up after my trip to Miami, so Cuban food was already on my mind.)\n\nThe Fricase de Pollo (Chicken Fricassee) was just okay. It wasn't particularly flavorful, and the bed of rice it came on was soggy. \n\nWe also ordered a beef pastelito, but got chicken. And while that's obviously not a terrible mistake, the pastelito itself was pretty bad. Much too sweet, and not in a good way. It was a little like those cheap danishes that someone brought to your office a few days ago, and that have just been sitting around since then. \n\nThe cafecito that came with our meal was a nice touch, but ultimately, this also left us pining for Miami. The foamy top was exceptional, and it was beautifully presented in a shot glass that allowed us to watch the foam settle out. But it just didn't have the richness that we were expecting. \n\nIt should also be said that the place was cute and the prices were reasonable. We particularly liked the crocodile-themed wall painting over the front door. \n\nUnderwhelming on a number of levels, and nowhere equal to the hype. \n\nThe Cuban place on Moller and 38th is far superior.",

I walked into the foodery and asked the guy behind the counter to use his phone to call a cab (my phone had died and at 11 am on a Sunday, cabs were not really around) because I had three massive bags of groceries and I couldn't carry them all the way home. Well needless to say the guy said well I'm using the phone, I offered to wait until he was done, but he just said there's cabs outside all the time and turned away. I had told him that I had already waited outside for 15 minutes and saw none available, And he just said no can't help you.

Excited I was I hurried back to the hotel. We ordered the combo platter w/ 3 meat choices. We had the 1/4th chicken, Ribs, and pulled pork with a side of green beans hoping they would have mac and cheese but didn't happen. Why only one side with a dinner like this every one else has two?? For $2.25 you can order another side our side was coleslaw a little 5oz serving. Make it quick the food had good flavor but all was dry. The BBQ was not smoked that day. Could tell it was all reheated. Sampled all 3 bbq sauces all were good. Also ordered brisket sandwich, they have two sizes ordered the large with a side of chips wanted to sub the chips for a side they told me they don't do that. Sandwich is loaded with beef not sure it was brisket though. Like to see smoke rings on the sliced brisket which I could not see, tasted a little like pot roast . I will try to eat there once again when I know that day they are smoken fresh Q . \" Read less",

The food is pretty good (appetizers somehow always being the highlight), but it is always SUPER crowded. Like, constantly apologizing to your neighbors for knocking elbows crowded. The tables are very close so that they can fit everyone. This also makes it difficult to carry a conversation\n\nBut the main reason for only 2 stars is the SERVICE! I've come here for lunch about a dozen times and they always push the buffet, which I understand, but they are VISIBLY annoyed when you don't want it. It's so rude! Last time I came here it was with 8 people, and the hostess asked if we were getting the buffet. I told her I didn't think any of us would, so if we could please get menus. Her face immediately changed, she said \"oh...\", and handed me 3 menus...for 8 people. When the waiter came we apologetically asked if we could have some more, and he pretty much had the same reaction! He rolled his eyes while turning to get more, and just dumped them on the table.\n\nSomething similar to this has seriously happened almost every other time!

I don't know why I keep expecting to have a good experience at a Night Market. \n\nIn theory this sounds like a cool event. Well, apparently by the size of the crowd I'm not the only one that thinks this. I mean Night Market is fun if you like waiting in long lines with swarms of people. \n\nI didn't have much time to dedicate to South Street Night Market. My group probably got to South Street around 7:30 and had to leave for another event by 9/9:30. Rather than waiting in a beer line, we beelined to the state store. What a saving grace! We were able to buy \"juice boxes\" of wine and no one cared that we were drinking them in public on the street. \n\nEarlier in the day, I had printed out the map and vendor list and checked off about 20-25 places I would like to try. I had hoped to hit at least 2-3 places. Wishful thinking! I know I was being picky about my selections and expectations... I wanted to try a vendor that I've never had before and I didn't want to pick a restaurant that had a store front that I can visit any old day. We started at 9th and by the time we got to the corner of 6th, I knew I had to make a quick decision if I wanted to eat before leaving. Ka'Chi was in the right place at the right time. Luckily it was on my preselected list of vendors.\n\nI spent the majority of my time at Night Market waiting in that line. I was surrounded by friends and the other people on line were friendly so it could have been worse...it also could have been better. I'll review Ka'Chi separately but in short the food was good and I'm glad I waited BUT it really wasn't worth the wait.  Philadelphia has really stepped up its game with food trucks so its probably best to find them on an \"off\" day. Unfortunately, I was only able to eat at one vendor and not make a dent on my ambitious list. \n\nI think I'll be passing on the next Night Market in China Town... unless the allure sucks me back in.",

No drink menu. Waitress recommended a margarita, and said they had a house margarita but didn't know what was in it. \n\nTook 35 min for a grouper sandwich and fish/chips (place was maybe 1/3 full). Drinks were warm and melted by the time our food arrived. Table next to us had ordered after us and received their food before us. Grouper was by far the smallest I've ever been served and didn't taste fresh ($14). \n\nOverall, the food wasn't horrible. However the staff's 'don't care' attitude really takes away from this place.",

    "text": "1st time going here and service was fine, but I got a platter of boiled crawfish (~4 lbs.) and not only was it way overpriced for not including anything like corn, sausage, mushrooms, etc., but it was bland. I'm not one for hyperbole but I can say this was the worst crawfish I've ever had in New Orleans. Tasted like it was boiled in just plain water. I didn't have a scale handy but I've eaten enough crawfish to know what four pounds looks like and this didn't look like it to me. They were mostly no bigger than my index finger and carefully arranged so that no plate was showing but with that amount there should be a mound and there was no mound. I'll give them the benefit of the doubt on size because I came pretty late in the day, but there's just no excuse for skimping on volume or a bland crawfish. It's a shame because I had scoped out the menu before and had wanted to try a lot of it but I'm reluctant now if they can't do a crawfish proper.",

    "text": "Thoroughly dissatisfied with today's experience at Judge Beans. Based on the menu, this establishment seems to pride itself on the brisket. I had the tacos and my wife had the brisket platter. The tacos come on deep fried corn tortillas, which you have two break in half in order to fold, effectively making it more of  a sandwich. The brisket was wholly inedible and flavorless. The fat overwhelmed the taco, and not the good, melt in your mouth fat, but the chewy, gristly fat. My wife's sliced brisket was no better. No juice , no smoke ring, no flavor. I left two of the three tacos on the plate and pushed it to the side. The waitress came by and took the plate with no inquiry as to why I wasn't eating them. We also ordered \"the best Mac and cheese from any Brentwood smokehouse\" or something to that effect for the kids, and it was clearly shells and cheese from a box. Not only was it completely uninteresting, but it was $5.50 per kid, served with toast and no drink included. We ordered kids lemonades that were $2.50 each, although that price was not listed on the kids menu. Once the check came with everything included, I told the waitress I was surprised she was charging me for the brisket and she asked \"why?\" When I explained, she said \"ok I'll tell them\". In the 5-10 minutes before we left, 'them' did nothing and I ended up paying $70 for a pitiful attempt at barbecue. If you want the real deal, you won't find it in Brentwood. Head on up 65 to Edley's, Martin's or Peg Leg Porker.",

    "text": "Let me start this off by saying that I've been here in the past and had a very pleasant experience. Not this time, though, and I'll come to why shortly.\n\nFirst of all, it was probably slightly busier than normal due to the Winter Classic.  Okay, I get that. But this entire visit was completely fumbled by the staff here, and I was ready to leave almost as soon as we sat down.\n\nNo one came by to take our drink order. We sat in the direct path of every server in the place (the kitchen entrance was literally one table behind us, so they constantly whizzed by us as breakneck speed), yet waited over 10 minutes just for a Coke and a beer sampler. \n\nFor the appetizer, we ordered the pale ale beer bread, which came with a blue cheese cream cheese and bacon jam. YUM. My only complaint is that the bread was totally soaked in grease. The cream cheese kinda slid off, but whatever. I made it work. \n\nThe beer sampler was great, too. We tried a variety of stouts, ales and ciders. My wife loved the double bean ale, and their coffee stout is always on point. For 5 small beers for $10, that's pretty much a steal.\n\nThe food, though...\n\nI ordered the pulled pork sandwich with potato wedges. Notice that I said wedges, as in plural? Well, I got five. FIVE WEDGES. And one was so big, I held it in my hand and pretended to be on Buffy the Vampire Slayer.  The sandwich was so cold, I didn't even eat it, and the fries were hotter than the surface of the sun. I took the sandwich home, hoping to heat it up later.\n\nMy wife got the apple and bacon pizza, if you could call it that. She asked for blue cheese on the side, not knowing that it wouldn't come with cheese otherwise. You know, like a normal pizza. And it didn't have some apple, it had, like, a whole apple. Like giant slices over a measly amount of bacon. It was sad, and it made me sad. \n\nI got my Coke refilled ONCE and that's only because Mary pulled a staff member aside to ask her for it. I felt bad because it wasn't her table, but our server was nowhere to be seen. \n\nMy hopes were high, but Schlaflys dashed them. I was planning on taking a dessert home, too, which makes me angriest of all!",

From the start this hovel of mediocrity fell on its face by not seating us at all; the hostess was not even at the door. We seated ourselves. Once we were in, the bar-tending waitress, who seemed to be running the show upstairs, took our drink orders, all the while giving off the aura of disdain and employment-regret that could sear hair off.\n\nWe had to wait around for over 30 min for someone to take our actual orders and after I took it upon myself to express to the waitress that were getting antsy. The forceful OK and stare I got back did tick me off but I decided I wouldn't make a huge deal of it. I gave her a well-timed \"Alright, [pause] Thank You\" until she broke eye contact and went back to our table. Not a pleasant experience. Even after all of this, someone was sent to \"confirm\" our orders 10 min later.\n\nWhen we finally received the food it didn't impress me terribly. The Fish and Chips plate was plentiful but the fish itself was somewhat greasy and bland. However, the Humus platter was huge and pretty darn tasty (but nothing that can't be found elsewhere). Decent prices though.\n\nThe dcor of this place was as mediocre as was everything else about it. Wooden booths and low lighting define this place, as well as ever other pub everywhere else; the only distinction being the occasional framed picture of a sheep.\n\n(I must admit I did not get to see much of the lower floor and dined upstairs)\n\nThe upstairs had large windows that may open to take in some night air - but they were closed when we were there. \nMy advice, if you're in the neighborhood go to Monk's just around the corner.

There were tables in the bar and we waited until we were able to snag one. Unfortunately, the bar menu is not the same as the dining menu.  We ordered chips and stuff to munch on while we waited.   The chips, guacamole, and pur\u00e9ed bean salsa were actually the highlight of our meal.   I ordered a beer.  Beware, there are no traditional beers here.  They only sell what is made in the brewery.   They also do not sell soda.  My kids had ice tea which was extremely bitter.  Too bad the bartender has not mentioned this to me.   \nThe real disappointment was the fish tacos.  As previous people have stated, Where Is The Fish????  I felt like I was eating nothing but breading.   At $12 for two tacos, I expect more then fried batter.   I also expect red cabbage cole slaw on a fish taco.  Our waitress was nice and so was the host. Not a place I would ever eat at again.   I am actually surprised at the high ratings.   My daughter and her friend had the hummus appetizer which they said was pretty good.",

    "text": "We ate here on a Friday evening. They were very busy and we had to wait about 10-15 minutes for a table. There is no waiting area inside the restaurant and with the amount of people standing and waiting for a table, we sat in the vestibule. It was very cold outside and with several people coming and going, we kept getting hit with doors and the cold air from outside. When they took us to our table, they were still cleaning it off. The menu itself was ragged and in need of replacement. They had a nice selection of items on the menu. I ordered the house salad with ginger dressing, which arrived very quickly. The ginger dressing seemed to be made in house (not from a bottle) - it was creamy and didn't have a strong ginger or sweet flavor. I did enjoy it and would recommend the house salad. I ordered the sesame chicken and my husband ordered the kung pao chicken. Our food was average. I prefer extra sauce and there was barely enough to cover my chicken. My husband said his dish was not spicy. The portions were a little small - about half of what you get when you order take out. Overall we were not impressed and probably will not return.",

    "text": "I just can't justify coming here for the food anymore. Every time I eat here the food has just been really disappointing and I consider myself pretty lenient when it comes to mexican food. I mean I'll eat almost anything. And I know I can't be the only one who feels unsatisfied by this place because I'm not even a terribly picky reviewer. \n\nMy top Mexican go-to list are usually: Carreta's Grill, Juan's Flying Burrito or Superior Grill. But I wanted to try something new. I've really TRIED to like this place. I have visited Casa Garcia maybe 3 times in the past year because it had this great reputation but I felt so disappointed every time and wanted to keep giving it another shot thinking maybe I was ordering the wrong things somehow. The queso is some sort of watered down cheese substance (and not like in a hot cheese kind of way, you could literally pour this stuff into your coffee like its a bowl of cream), the chili relleno had the same cheese inside it so that sort of turned me off, nachos are always soupy and soggy (even right when they get to the table), the fajitas are small, the rice is stale. I don't know I mean I just don't get anything out of this place and I happen to LOVE Mexican food! \n\nA friend of mine always gets the enchiladas and he swears by it so maybe that's what you need to get there. But I'd hate to try it for the fourth time only to be further disappointed. \n\nNot to mention the sanitation problem this place seems to have. You can tell they don't clean much, which to be fair, isn't some big requirement for me. There's plenty of hole in the wall shady looking places with great food right? But what I CAN'T ignore is the extremely dirty silverware. I mean there were GIANT obnoxious unmissable amounts of food caked onto my fork and knife from the last person. It looked like they didn't even bother soaking it in some hot sanitized water before throwing it in the dishwasher and baking it right on there. It was pretty gross. I jacked the silverware from the next table over but found the same thing. It took browsing through 3 different sets to find a suitable fork. I mean....c'mon that's just disturbing on so many levels....\n\nThe only reason this place really even gets 2 stars is because I've always had a pleasant experience if I JUST sit at the bar and drink a margarita. Their happy hour (2-4-1 margaritas) is a pretty solid deal and the complementary bean and salsa dip that comes with the chips are actually surprisingly decent! The bartender has always been really friendly and knowledgable about tequilas and we have a nice chat.\n\nHowever, you basically NEED to go visit the bar and drink your sorrows away after encountering the food there....\n\nSorry Casa Garcia, but we just aren't compatible. Maybe I'll come back for a happy hour special once in a blue moon but that's about all I can give you :-(",

This cafe had good reviews, so we figured to give it a shot.  We were seated right away and the menu had a ton of options to choose from.  The food was mediocre breakfast food and affordable, but nothing out of this world.  We probably would have considered to go back if it weren't for the service.  Immediately after our food was brought to our table, the check was placed down, never asking us if we were going to want anything additional.  We sat down at 11:00am, the food came out pretty quickly, but by 12:00pm we were getting kicked out of our seats by the owner.  There were about four open tables for the older women that wanted to sit down, but for some reason it had to be our table.  I could understand if we were holding up the table for hours while there was a line, but there were several open tables and only 5 people (not groups) waiting to be seated.  We were meeting up with friends we had not seen in a while and it was unfortunate to be rushed out after only an hour.  Needless to say, we will not be back!",

The food is always great & was very good on this occasion. \n\nHowever, we were really disappointed with the Mother's Day Brunch.  I understand brunch isn't usually part of your offerings, but to not have a kids' menu at 10:15am on Mother's Day (aside from the lunch/dinner) was a huge miss for us. \n\nI am sure this is a very busy day but instead of enjoying a leisurely brunch we were in & out in less than 40 minutes.  Our bread had barely cooled off before we were served our entrees.  Well, almost all the entrees. My food showed up about five minutes after everyone else's. \n\nWhen you are heading out for a special day & open to spending a bit more than usual for a Sunday brunch, I guess I just expected a bit more effort.",

    "text": "Thouroughly disappointed by this one; I litterally starved myself up until 6pm to save every bit of room in my stomach for this night... I stopped at 5 different food trucks only to be met by sup par food and astronomical prices. \n\nMy stops included SAMOSA DEB: $10 for Curry chicken with rice and Samosa - Horrible! Rice was overcooked to the point it was unrecognizable. It was mush. There was no curry. It taste more like a bland Indian dish which I have never had. The spices were there but there was no salt. The dosa was mushy. It was disgusting! \n\nNext stop K-TOWN KOREAN FRIED CHICKEN: $8 for 4 chicken wings supposedly cooked Korean Style. Save your time and your money and go straight to Cafe Soho! The wings were breaded and there was more breading than chicken. What a let down. \n\nThen on to THE COW AND THE CURD: $14 for gloriFRIED cheese and a frozen lemonade. It was a fancier version of a mozzarella stick. Sadly enough this is what I enjoyed the most. What left the bitter tast in my mouth from the visit to this truck? I was with friends from Atlanta who came to Philly for the Night Market so I wanted to share. I asked the OWNER for an extra dish to split the curds and his reply \"NO, WE HAVE NO EXTRA DISHES. TRY USING A NAPKIN.'' As I looked behind him to mounds of extra paper containers. Wow, way to loose a customer buddy. \n\nNow on to RELISH: $8 for Chicken In Waffles, yes people pieces of chicken were chopped up and  infused in the mini waffles, add a pat of maple syrup butter on top, yum yum. Sounds amazing right??? Yeah that's what I was thinking until I bit in to the waffle and my pallet was met by the DISGUSTING taste of DARK MEAT CHICKEN. My entire body quivered as I spit the waffle in to a napkin!  Come on RELISH, you should disclose this as not everyone has the stomach for dark meat...in the trash it went.\n\nI will not be returning to this Night Market! I saw the reviews but I really tried to give this one the benefit of the doubt. We were so disappointed we ended up driving to Jim's Steaks in West Philly to satisfy our food cravings. I will give the one in Chinatown a try in the Fall. My suggestions to my Foodies, avoid this one...",

    "text": "Yeah, it's really pretty bad... The folks who work there are nice, on the whole, so I'm giving it a second star.\n\nI've been going here for years since my time in school. Unless you're willing to walk to 10th street, this is one of your few grocery store options in the area. Spruce Mart on 15-16th and, um, Spruce, is decent enough, but that's really a big corner store/bodega. DiBruno brothers is excellent, but up on Chestnut and 18th, and more of a specialty item store--not where you get your cereal and 2% milk. There's Sue's for produce also up 18th, but they just sell produce. So in the end, you're stuck with the \"Shttenhouse,\" as I like to call it.\n\nThe produce here is poor to bad, and they make little effort to make it even look fresh. The green leafy veggies are often wilted, brown, and withered, and the fruit either way to early to put out or, more often, a bit rotted here and there. \n\nIt's been a long time since I've bought meats there. I probably wouldn't, either.\n\nAnd so not a huge selection, very poor produce, and an extremely high price point for what you get makes this place a bad choice unless you have no other option, which I guess is how they stay in business. Avoid it if you can get what you want somewhere else and it's convenient to you.",

Here are the highlights: Waiter was confused and didn't know brunch menu very well. Menu said ask Waiter for french toast and eggs Benedict. Waiter says thats not the case but he'd be willing to go to the bar and get for us. Carving station and omelet station was run by one person who was trying not to get overwhelmed. Buffet selection was large but the gravy and clam chowder tasted pretty much the same, as did many of the dishes which was odd.

    "text": "Summary: terrible value, unreasonable wait times, extremely inattentive service staff, and perhaps worst of all, smooth jazz. \n\nWhen I read some of the reviews on here, I feel like I must have gone to a different restaurant than everybody else. My experience was not a positive one. Let me first say that my friends are now mad at me for bringing them here. I thought it would be hard to go wrong with a 5-star reviewed restaurant, but I was completely mistaken.\n\nNow, the few positives: the jerk chicken was tasty, and the johnny cakes moreso. The staff was courteous. That's it.\n\nThe staff. We got in at 8, and they came for the drink order at 8:25. We ordered our food at the same time, because we didn't know when we'd see them again. Twice in the next half hour, they came by twice to confirm our orders. Some mix-up. We noticed this happening at other tables around us as well. (Some of) the food arrived at 9:30. We waited for more than an hour for our meals! And two of our side orders were forgotten. Was the restaurant unusually busy? Only 60% of the tables were occupied. The other problem with the servers is that, like the menu, they didn't make clear what came with the meals. If somebody is ordering something that already comes with the meal, the staff would think to tell them, right? No. And if you order a beverage, expect it to be about 80% ice. My friends finished theirs in a few sips. So we had to ask for more beverages, and the staff did not bring any. Finally one friend had to go to their car to get some water. A good 20 minutes later I was able to flag them down, and we finally got more to drink. Everyone was cordial, but ignored us for most of the night. The word amateurish comes to mind.\n\nThe ambience? Well, the dining room is nicely decorated, but too cramped. The gentleman at the table behind me kept ramming into my chair. There was just no room. It also would have been nice if they weren't showing The Walking Dead on the big screen TV in front of me. I don't really want to see stabbings and blood spurting while I'm eating. The biggest problem with the setting, though, was the music. A never-ending procession of smooth jazz played at an uncomfortably high volume. I want to know, who actually enjoys that music? My friend said it felt like being trapped in a dentist's waiting room.\n\nThe food. My friend who ordered beef patties said that they were lousy. And we all agreed that the rice and peas were completely flavorless. It came in a 'bowl' the size of a tea cup. As I mentioned, the jerk chicken was tasty, but the portion laughably small. The large portion meal at Yah Mon is significantly smaller than the regular portion at Jerk Hut. I understand that it's organic, but when you order the large portion, you shouldn't go home hungry. And that's exactly what I did. \n\nThe only reason I'm not giving 1 star is because some of the minuscule portions of food were tasty.\n\nObviously, none of us are going back, and I couldn't recommend Yah Mon to anyone with whom I wanted to stay friends.",

On the plus side, it is bright and clean appearing and the wait staff is attentive.\nOnly problem is that they got my order complete wrong and I ended up with something I didn't order.  Not wanting to wait another 1/2 hour I went ahead and ate it.  OK food, not great but OK-maybe on par with Taco Bell or a little better.\nDaughter did not finish her meal-said it was bearly eatable.\nI would recommend that folks wanting Mexican in Brownsburg look elsewhere-there are a couple of place that are much better than this.",

The service was really slow and the chef was on his phone right in my face! He didn't even answer me when I tried to get his attention.\nThe food was fine I guess...\nOverall I would not recommend this place. If you're looking for somewhat authentic Japanese food look elsewhere! As an American, I spoke more Japanese than the entire staff combined. There's plenty of great food in Santa Barbara so just go somewhere else.",

    "text": "It is with a heavy heart that I have to write this review. \nI gave this place so many second chances because I used to work in the building it resides in, the Indiana Historical Society, and was the closest option for lunch. \nThe complaint is with the service. \nI could list the numerous times when an order I placed earlier in the day wasn't ready on time, but that is a special arrangement for IHS employees.\nBut in my last week, everything went downhill.\nThe first incident occurred when I ordered a salad with no dressing. One of the cooks had to exclaim in the nearly empty cafe \"No dressing?!? Who in their right mind doesn't eat dressing?!\" This is just out and out unnecessarily rude. As a former food server, I've ran across my fair share of bizarre food orders, and one doesn't say anything about it until the customer is gone or go somewhere  the customer can't hear you, and say it there. I said something to the manager, which rendered dirty looks from the cooks and a retaliation.\nThe final time I ate there: once again my early order for a grilled cheese was late. I was made to wait 20 minutes of my 30 minute lunch break to cook a two cheese and tomato sandwich. When I got it, the cheese was barely warm and not melted. I complained, and was thrown attitude back from the manager for not ordering sooner. Ordering at 10:30 am for a 1:30pm pick up is not early enough? For a half-assed grilled cheese?!  The cook who criticized my food choice earlier in the week gave me a condescending smile from the kitchen. The retaliation was complete. And I was not given a refund. \nFinal straw.\nI wanted to forewarn everyone that the cooks (for now) apparently have no respect for customers, and aren't afraid to show it. Management and the cooks are in a revolving door mode, so I have no doubt that they will be gone soon enough. So I might recant this review in the future. \nNormally the food is fantastic and I can totally recommend the curry chicken salad sandwich, the french fries (crack fries as the employees call them), the quiches, and the grilled cheeses - when they are fully cooked.",

    "text": "My sweetheart and I came here for a quick lunch on a weekend day. We were both in the mood for something different and wanted something quick and had a craving for something (somewhat) Asian. \n\nThe place was pretty dead only one other table occupied. All other tables were clean and had no lingering bento boxes or empty soda bottles. Dirty tables is my biggest pet peeve in faster food establishments! \n\nWe each ordered a Bento, mine with tempura and \"dumplings\" his with tempura and sushi. They both came out looking quite appetizing and very generous. \n\nThe beef teriyaki tasted like roast beef sandwich meat with bottled teriyaki sauce. And the rice was cold and mushy. Likely over cooked! My dumplings were bland and I gave them to the BF to finish, the bento came with 3 and I only ate one. The small salad of carrot and bean sprouts were probably the best thing in the box. Actually no, the tempura yam was! It was light and not overly greasy, but still nothing to write home about. As for the fruit... Well... It was canned and all tasted the same, syrupy and canny! If that's even a word :-( \n\nService was average and price was not equal to value. Sadly, I will not be back and would rather spend my $15 on Edo Japan or another fast food joint.",

Themeat was super tough, not tender at all, the sauce was very ordinary and I had a plate filled with spaghetti I didn't even know what to do with.

They put cashews and a lettuce thing on the table when you get there but they are both unappetizing. With your bill they give you fortune cookies and a strange peeled orange.

I don't mean poorly operating heat, I mean no heat. No apology, no comp soup, no extra candle. NADA. \n\n#2 no liquor, they do have beer, wine, and wine margaritas. Suggestion, if the wine margarita is any good, offer a 1.5 oz portion with you chips as a sample \n\n#3 strike- sides of rice and beans were cold, rice cooked to a consistency of wallpaper paste. \n\nDidn't stay for dessert, too cold. My wife never had both her gloves off during dinner. \n\nOK the good, yes there was good.
