I have been to it's other locations in NJ and never had a bad experience. \n\nThe food is good, but it takes a very long time to come out. The waitstaff is very young, but usually pleasant. We have just had too many experiences where we spent way too long waiting. We usually opt for another diner or restaurant on the weekends, in order to be done quicker.",

I understand making mistakes but the restaraunt was really quiet so we were kind of surprised. Usually hibachi is a fun lively experience and our  cook  said maybe three words, but he cooked very well his name was Francisco. Service was fishy, food was pretty good, and im hoping it was just an off night here. But for the money I wouldn't go back.",

    "text": "Upland is a brewery based out of Bloomington, Indiana that has become popular enough to open up a couple additional locations in central Indiana.  All of their beers are very good, and I am also a fan of their burgers and tenderloins.  Therefore, I was excited to try their pizza, but I don't think it ended up being on par with these other items.  My margherita pizza had a cracker-like crust and was pretty light overall.  The cheese was good, but none of the other toppings added much flavor.  There was no red sauce as is typical for a true margherita pizza.  My opinion is that Upland's pizza might serve as a nice appetizer for a group, but I'll be sticking with their burgers or tenderloins as my meal of choice on future visits.",

    "text": "I visited this restaurant 4 times during my 5 days stay. Crazy, right? Here are a list of reasons/pros:\n\n- We were staying a nearby hotel.\n- The restaurant opens 11 - 10:30 pretty much every day including new year's day so it fits into our schedule.\n- If you are a party of two, chances are you get seated right away.\n- $9 per dozen of oysters which is a really great deal by any standard!\n- They have a seafood shop next door that sells boiled and fresh seafood to- go.\n- Our server (same) is very friendly and recognized us every single time.\n\nNow I want to talk about the reasons why I only give it 3 stars.\n\n- We tried a bunch of stuff which are all pretty mediocre. Raw oysters are not cleaned well. So if your schedule is flexible, go to Superior Seafood during their happy hours for their 50 cents/oyster - better quality and cheaper. Turtle soup has a strange taste so I definitely prefer Felix's. A portion of my boiled shrimps are always mushy somhow, maybe boiled for too long?...\n- The ambient is inviting but not comfortable so we basically just finished our food and go. \n- Clean the bathroom!!\n\nWill probably visit again if we stay in the area next time or simply just pick up some seafood quickly.",

After being told this place branched off from California, I was disappointed. \n\nI'm more of a natural person. I enjoy real flavor, real fruits, and of course the perfect boba. I notice that some flavors were used by real fruits but others were just powder which I could definitely taste the different. Especially the taro flavor, being one of my favorites. \n\nBut, if you're not too concern about natural vs powder flavor then this place could be good for you. They ask what level you would like you sweetness and any additional add-ons you would like. I always get boba but sometimes the grass jelly is pretty good too! I'd recommend you try. \n\nThis is also a good place to catch up, talk, play board, card games and even do homework. I know it's always busy with students from the U of A and being told from them it's a nice area to just hang out, that's a pretty good sign. \n\nMaybe I'm just too picky, but I think it could be better. \n\n\"See it, taste it, Yelp it\"",

We ordered the blackened alligator and oysters for appetizers, the alligator came out within 15 minutes, and it was alright. A bit too greasy. Then another 15 minutes later, our raw oysters came out, I wanted mine char grilled but the waitress didn't mention they don't have char grilled oysters and still took my order, so I thought I was waiting for mine to be cooked the entire time. When she brought out the two half-dozen raw oyster trays, that's when she told me they only have raw oysters there. SMH. I have sensitive stomach so I only had 3 then gave the rest to my husband. Regardless, the oysters were really fresh. We waited for at least another 20 minutes later for our entrees to come out. At this point, I was really hungry and had hoped we were at home eating ramen noodles instead. My husband had the roast beef po-boy, and I had the tuna and shrimp kabob. My husband told me his roast beef was really salty and while ironically, my kabob was very bland. The kabob came with exactly 3 pieces of cubed tuna, 2 medium size shrimp with plenty of bell peppers and onions in between, and baby shrimp creole with rice. For the ok price, I shouldn't complain too much about this place. Didn't try their seafood boil, but it looked like that would have been a better choice.",

Some wineries will give their members a complimentary glass in leau of a tasting (Carr).   Most wineries allow you to bring guests which is how you get new wine club members.   This system works folks!  The way this wine club works is that you are given a very limited number of passes per quarter, five as I recall.   If I come with my wife once a month we wouldn't even be covered... let alone if we bring a guest!   \n\nSo go to this winery if you want to enjoy a tasting in one of the most beautiful settings on earth.   But avoid the wine club!  For that you can pretty much go to any of the other wine tasting rooms on the Urban wine trail.",

I got the sugar and spice pancakes. All were well and fine, a bit dry. I don't understand the hype, but if the line isn't too long it's not bad for normal breakfast food. If the line is longer I would highly recommend skipping this place and heading down the street to Fido - insanely good coffee and great breakfast food.",

First, I understand it was Sunday night before Fat Tuesday and our waitress was working back to back 12 shifts. However, my drink order was forgotten, and my friends plate was mixed up. For my food, I had the po'boy shrimp and was underwhelmed, there was a hardy serving of shrimp but there was minimal lettuce or sauce and the fries were weak, many soggy. Needless to say, we didn't go back. From other reviews seems like we caught them on an off-day but unfortunately the result is a lack luster review.",

That kind of attitude is exactly why I left New York. We wanted to order a bottle of wine, asked for his suggestion, and he answers with, \"How much do you want to spend?\" Ummm... Excuse me? How about, \"I'm happy to make some recommendations. Let's find a price point you're comfortable with...\" He didn't smile ONCE during the meal service and also found it necessary to correct us on several points of preference. Snob. The food is GOOD. The only thing that was great was the blueberry lasagna. And it is superb. So was the chocolate confection for dessert. I'd say go. And I hope you don't get that waiter.",

It was packed and seemed like the place to be for locals. The inside is nice but small, only a few tables in the entire place. The service was just okay. \n\nThe beer selection is very good as are the prices on the beer. The food menu was a bit limited with you're basic bar food. The wife went with the bbq pulled pork and I went with the chicken and honey mustard wrap. The bbq pork was good, the bun was nicely toasted but the sauce was overly sweet for our liking. The wrap was fresh and good but nothing spectacular. The fries were hot and crispy. The kale slaw was fantastic but a very small portion.\n\nOverall it was a decent meal.

    "text": "The long and the short of it: A romantic little BYOB in Newtown Square that hits the mark in several areas. Big portions at decent prices. You won't leave hungry!\n\nAnd now for a full review:\n\nI have been to this Fellini's Cafe and the one in Bryn Mawr several times and each time I've visited there have been some memorable moments...and there have been speed bumps that keep this place from reaching its full potential.\n\nOn my latest visit this past Friday night, I made reservations for 730. My beautiful wife and I arrived right at 730. Although there were two vacant tables available, it took them at least 10 minutes or so to seat us. And when they did, they broke up a table for 6 instead of putting us at the 2 seater. Odd.\n\nBeing out and away from the kids for a few hours, we wanted at least a little bit of privacy, instead of sitting next to (pretty much connected to) a table of four. We asked the manager if we could be moved to the 2 seater...he said fine. Another 5-10 minutes (too long!) later a member of the wait staff came and, without any indication as to his intentions, whisked up our bottle of wine and silverware and ran off to the other table. Not a problem, but some eye contact and a simple 'follow me please' with even a hint of a smile would have been lovely. We shrugged and just rolled with it.\n\nThe interior is quaint, and the lighting is dim. It's a nice place for a romantic meal. But it is LOUD. So loud I would say this place is kid friendly despite being in such close quarters with your neighbors. Not sure if we'd ever try taking our four kids there (actually I'm certain we won't) but one or two can be done without much trouble.\n\nOur waitress was extremely polite and offered the energy and enthusiasm that our other friend lacked.\n\nFor dinner, we ordered a caesar salad to share and for our main courses my wife opted for her usual tagliatelli with mushroom cream sauce and i had what i always have, the tortellini pasticiatti.\n\nComplimentary with the meal were two pieces of bruschetta (very nice) and a small loaf of crusty Italian bread, which is served with butter packets (which perhaps only I find strange for an Italian restaurant?). \n\nOverall the food was delicious, except for a few somewhat minor hiccups: \n\n1. The caesar salad was served on a warm plate. The salad was excellent and would have been legendary had it been served on a chilled (or at least not warm!) plate.\n\n2. I am pretty sure they used frozen peas in the tortellini dish, which is fine with me as long as you make sure the peas are thawed before you serve it! Only a few peas were not quite thawed, but it marred what was otherwise a perfectly crafted masterpiece of a dish.\n\nWhen we paid, the manager allowed us to use an expired gift card. That was a very nice gesture and one that required no push from us to induce.\n\nAll in all, I'll keep visiting Fellini because it's relatively inexpensive and they do most everything well.",

The food was very good for the parents but everything was on the spicy side which was not so great for the kids and grandparents.

I usually pay $4 to $5 for it at other sushi restaurants. The mango sake drink I have was alright, but not worth the price I paid for it. \n\nOn to the main event...SUSHI! We had the philly roll, tempura roll, tuna roll, and california roll. They were all yummy, but I would have to say I have had better. Actually, out of the hand-full of sushi restaurants I have tried, this was the worst sushi I have tried, but I cannot say the sushi was bad by any means. Don't get me wrong, it was still tasty. \n\nThe other big thing was that the rolls were actually falling apart. I have never had this happen. Therefore, I can say that the presentation and the ability to get the sushi from the plate to my mouth without falling apart did make me unhappy. \n\nI am willing to come back to Nippon Tei, but I have to say I already have my other favorites. The prices were average compared to other sushi bars, so that won't really help them out either when it comes to bringing me back. We will see!",

It is one of the best we have tried. \n\nThe place could have earned higher points. But I have to give it a three stars because of the chaotic seating arrangement. The owner gave tables to people behind us despite we reminded the him and the staff. Perhaps that is what you get when you go to a teeny tiny Chinese restaurant during a long weekend.",

Our table was ready early so the bar staff transferred our starter to the table and things went down hill quickly. Starters were delivered and then we were ignored for over 45 minutes. No drinks, water etc. Finally a waiter in another section took out order. We ordered BBQ shrimp (best thing on our table), rabbit and wood plank grilled fish. Fish was a very small piece and not worth the $$$. Rabbit was good! Hit and miss service ruined the experience.",

This last time we ordered cioppino, clam chowder, and a crab salad sandwich;\n*Good - clam chowder (excellent flavor and consistency) would order again.\n*Not great - cioppino (lacked flavor & a variety of sea food/lack there of) would not order again\n*Pass - crab salad sandwich (lacked flavor, mayo was overpowering, crab flavor was almost non-existent, side of onion rings too greasy) - would not order again \nThe overall experience is okay, better if seated outside right on the pear overlooking the ocean, inside is very small. Service is good but be prepared to wait a bit to be seated. \nIs it worth a visit? Yes, but be selective of what you order as the menu tends to be a hit and miss.",

For value, go elsewhere.  For pretty food, lovely store displays and a feeling of smugness, check out Whole Foods.\n\nDespite my snark, I have to admit that it's nice to see an enormous, clean and well stocked yuppie market in Reno finally.  Now that this town has been rated by National Geographic as a top outdoors place to live in, it needs the retail to support that (and I don't mean another REI).  For myself, I'm too cheap to look seriously at this place for my regular shopping needs, but for lunch and the odd stopover, it's awesome.   Beautiful produce, drool inducing cheese selections and a bakery that would break my budget if I bought everything that struck my fancy.\n\nPlus it's proximity to the freeway (for those of us who do our shopping based on distance from the 395 or 80) makes it an ideal stop to/from the airport.",

Certainly not the best I've ever had but good enough. The to go packaging was a bit overkill just for that one slice of cake, as was the $10 price tag. That being said, I'm sure the \"fanciness\" of the place is what makes it so appealing to folks. It really is quite unique and cute for our area and would be a good place to go with the gals (rather than my husband who hates all things trendy, lol). \n\nMy problem, though, was with the service. We placed our order for the carrot cake with a nice young teenager, and then waited. And waited. I could see the carrot cake just sitting in the pretty covered cake stand, and I felt really tempted to just slice it myself. After a bit (felt like 10 minutes, although I'm sure it was more like 5 or 6), another employee came and sliced the carrot cake, setting the slice on the back counter with the ticket. And then we waited. And waited some more. After about another 5 to 10 minutes, I flagged the teenager down and asked if he could box up the cake for us. He seemed confused, and it took an awkward minute-long exchange for him to understand we hadn't yet received our order. He did apologize for the wait, which I do appreciate, boxed up the cake, and then we were on our way.\n\nI should clarify that we did not go into the shop at a busy time. It was a relatively cool day and not many people were out. While there were maybe 2 to 3 tables seated, we were the only ones at the counter ordering. And while I'm sure the wait staff who repeatedly walked by our lonely piece of carrot cake sitting on the back counter had many important tasks...I just wanted to eat my $10 cake.\n\nFour stars for the cake. Two stars for the service.",

The ravioli were definitely homemade, they were a little light on the filling which made them less flavourful then they should have been. Service was great,  the place was so loud the wait staff had a hard time hearing us unless we raised our voice. Good place. Extremely tiny and tables are jammed in. Not recommended for a date night. With so many great places to eat in this neighborhood the only thing that would bring me back is the fact it's bring your own bottle. Otherwise I know I could find something as good or better with less noise, a tad more elbow room, and more flavor",

Of course I booked late and I didn't want to spend $200+/night on these hotel rooms! Otherwise this place is ginormous. The service (shuttle), lunch/drinks were really well done.  This place is immaculate; I do not know how many workers they staff.  \n\nThe food of course is overpriced (I had lunch/dinner at Wasabi. My bento box was $25.  Overpriced right?)  I also had lunch at the pizza place Paisano (forgot the name).   \n\nIf you decide to stay at the hotels across the street from the convention center (it is only 1 mile away - across from the McGovick Pwky).  They have Cracker Barrel, Apple Bees, Chillis?, McDonalds there.  The hotel I stayed in (being on a student budget) was crappy but I can't complain for $55/night.  It was Days Inn. It was walkable to shuttle pick up stop at Marriott Hotel (walk ~0.3 miles).  \n\nThey have Finleys pub, FUSE (night/club), STAX burger, Jack Daniels and more restaurants inside this convention center.  \n\nI posted some photos.",

The food was ok, we got the Kale Ceaser and the Fried chicken with mac n cheese.

Darn shame too as I really did like this place, but I must admit that I still am not confident they have their act in order. My suggestion is they need to cook their meat longer and ensure it reaches optimum 165\u00b0F Temp, serve the food very hot temp to ensure bacteria are dead, and only source their greens and veggies from USA only sources. Avoid Mexico as they have big issues with water pollution cross-contamination.",

    "text": "We visited this place because of its location on the wharf, and because my husband loves seafood. It's tiny, but we were there on a Tuesday evening, and only had to wait a few minutes. We ended up sitting at the bar; it would have been a longer wait for a table outside, since there are so few. Because of its size, it's a little noisy, but not bad. The service was very good. My husband had the crab sandwich, and wasn't impressed. It's served on very uninspiring white bread. I had the fried shrimp, and enjoyed it very much; it was not greasy or heavy, and the shrimp was moist and tasty. There is literally nothing but shellfish on the menu. So, the non-seafood enthusiast (me) was happily surprised to enjoy the shrimp so much (plus good onion rings), but the seafood enthusiast (my husband) didn't love the crab sandwich. If we tried this place again, he would order something else. The location is awesome, so if you like shellfish, definitely give this place a try.",

Aww, you gotta get out earrrrrly for *that*\".  We still laugh about it....\n\nWell, over the last few years, we're noticing more & more places recognizing veggies like to eat Southern / Cajun comfort food & they are starting to open up their menus to us! ( YAY)\n\nSeeing that Muriel's Jackson Square had such an offering, we made rezzies to ensure we veggies got fed - you'll want to do this too - veggie or not!  They were packed & quoting 2 hr waits & this was at 9pm!\n\nStarted w/ drinkys at the bar - Sazerac for the Mr & I had the uber-delish Honey Child cocktail: honey-infused vodka & muddled blackberries.  The Mr liked mine so well that he ordered 1 too, to go w/ dinner & just to be nice, I had another as well so he wouldn't have to drink alone\n\nTheir veggie appie had eggplant, of which I'm not a fan so we asked the waitress if they could make their Goat Cheese Crepe, veggie & she said sure.  Since the description said it was topped w/ crawfish, we thought, this would be easy..... but unfortunately, the roulade sauce was made seafood stock. ACK!  Wished you had told us this!  The Mr however, said the crepe was nice & plump, the goat cheese was creamy & smooth & he liked it, barring the sauce\n\nMains consisted of their Veggie Soiree - this was a sampling of little dollops of veggie tastes - some you'll find on their side dish offerings & some not\n\nDivine beets & roasted acorn squash\n\nPolenta topped w/ chickpeas & a basil sauce - flavorful though those beans were crunchy & could have used a bit more time in the cooker.... same w/ the crunchy wild rice\n\nYams were very flavorful & had lots of ginger - the Mr got to indulge in both our dollops of chard - I tried a bite & it triggered my dislike for cooked greens\n\nToo full for dessert, we left w/ happy tummies & thankfulness for a nice veggie night out.  A-OK night!",

The main reason we chose this location was because it was close to the Winspear, and open late (until 11:30pm on Friday and Saturday). I don't have any strong criticisms of the restaurant. I suppose, if anything, the menu may have seemed a little bit over-priced - at least for what I ordered. I had a Caesar salad with three 'jumbo' shrimp on it, which cost $15. The portion size did not seem to justify the cost and the jumbo shrimp were fairly average in their size, but the flavours were good and the ingredients were fresh. My friend had a soup, which looked and smelled absolutely amazing, and at $6 it didn't seem too unreasonable. She also had the smoked salmon Carpaccio, which looked very appetizing with its thick slices of dark rye bread and generous slices of smoked salmon and capers. The also had a couple of interesting beers on their menu that we were keen to try.\n\nI think if you're going to a show in the area and looking for a spot to get a drink or a snack afterward, this is not a bad option. Their menu at that time of night had an interesting mix of appetizers and desserts that seemed to provide something to suit most tastes.\n\nI'm assuming Normand's Bistro must be connected to the Normand's restaurant which is on Jasper Avenue. Of interest, I have heard that Normand's took over the brunch menu that had formerly been offered at the Glenora Bistro.",

    "text": "I've been to Mount Laurel's On the Border over 50 times. I used to go to Don Pablo's but I fell in love with On the Border's chips and salsa (their chips are nice and salty, and their salsa is a little spicier).\n\nWhen I go, 90% of the time I just sit at the bar and drink beer and snack on their chips and salsa. The beer specials are pretty good but could be a little better- weekdays has a happy hour as well as a late night happy hour too.\n\nWhen I do dine, I often just enjoy a variety of vegetarian sides. Lately, I've grown to enjoy their cheese enchiladas, which I find delicious. Service when dining is usually great.\n\nAs for the bartenders, it's really hit-or-miss. Joann is probably my favorite- she's friendly, attentive, funny, and I've really gotten to know her, and I'd give them 5 stars if my experience was with her alone. There is a bartender named Nikki though, and if she's there, I always get the worst service. She barely checks on me/us to see how we're doing, she seems unfriendly, if she actually comes to refill your chips then she will not refill your salsa, she has taken my beer and refilled it without asking (when I was done and trying to leave), and I've had to wait forever to ask her for my check. At least twice, I've had to ask other bartenders to bring my check so that I could finally close out and leave. I'd give them 1 star if my experience was based on her alone.\n\nOverall, good appetizers, cold beer, moderate prices, and usually good service.",

Our egg drop soup came out right away at a nice piping hot temperature and when the rest of our food came out it was practically room temperature. \n\nFeeling adventurous, I had ordered the Shrimp with Candied Walnuts entree with brown rice while he ordered the Sesame Chicken platter. I like the idea of sharing food, but my food was too busy all on its own without adding something else to the mix. The brown rice was cold and very bland while the shrimp was overly sweet and I didn't feel like the candied walnuts and melon balls were complementary flavors.\n\nThe chocolate cake we had for dessert was amazing though; 6 layers of chocolate on chocolate. It was so sweet and rich, we ended up sharing a slice.\n\nSo to sum up, service was great, dessert was great, but the food needs some work. Sorry PF Changs, I just am not impressed.\n\nOne thing I will note (that our server told us) is that they are very big on catering to food allergies (especially gluten).",

Nothing mind blowing here just a really good lo mein or spicy pasta dish with virtually no protein more or less. Also had the scallion pancakes. I was just in Chinatown recently at a place I also reviewed (first person from Yelp to do so) and they were way better there. ( I highly recommend you try that place) These were more like quesadillas laying flat where as the other ones jumped off the plate and were so much more crispy and substantial. The last appetizer I had was the Wontons in Chilli oil. These were just not good to me at all and one bite was all I needed. Basically it is steamed Wontons in a bowl with the soup being the chilli oil. Just heavy heavy choking heat with very little substance or taste. Take those same homemade wontons and pan fry them with some chilli peppers and a nice light sauce and you have could a real winner but I digress. Finally we tried the Talapia Medallions . These were fried to perfection but there were some greens mixed in that I could not chew through and had to discard via the old napkin trick which to me is a bit of a deal/star breaker.\n\nThe service was very good and the atmosphere very nice but I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here again. All I could think about was how much more I prefer Cantonese style where its all about flavors and you can add heat as you like it. I'm sure I could find better authentic Szechuan cuisine that better suits my taste just not here. It feels very commercialized and Americanized. I prefer the hole in the wall places where I am the only caucasian in the place a heck of a lot more.",

I really wanted to like it, and it has gotten so many positive reviews, so I thought it was a sure thing, but it was just a little underwhelming. Not bad, just not amazing. I had the costanza, and the fillings were tasty, but the crust was disappointing. It was way too bread-y, as opposed to doughy, and when I think of a calzone, I think of dough like pizza dough- this was not that. The calzones are a good size, but they were a little skimpy with the meat fillings. Probably the most disappointing part was the dessert- we got the apple pie calzone, and it just had a really weird spice to it- something other than cinnamon that I couldn't put my finger on. It also didn't have that many chunks of apples inside- it was almost pureed apple. Meh. \n\nI like the vibe of this place and it's close and convenient to where i live, so I really want to like it, but I just wasn't thrilled with it the first time.

Our decision to dine here was largely based on the fact that it was pouring raining and this restaurant is next door to our hotel. We started with the bacon garlic oysters and jumbo buffalo wings. The bacon garlic oysters were average, at best. The oysters were overpowered by the cheese and bacon, which was disappointing. The buffalo wings were pretty good and seasoned well. For entrees, we ordered: 1) jumbalaya pasta, 2) blackened red fish and 3) canal street red fish. The jumbalaya pasta lacked flavor and was our least favorite (would not order again). The blackened red fish was just okay and the skimpy side of saut\u00e9ed veggies (spinach, tomatoes, mushrooms) were VERY salty (would order again as a LAST resort). The canal street red fish wasn't great but my friend would order it again. Her biggest complaint was that it had very little garlic sauce. We also ordered paddle boat drinks, which tasted good but were more juice vs alcohol (had to order an extra shot).\n\nSo, overall, we were underwhelmed with the food, making it a solid 3 stars.

I wouldn't call it bad, but it's a whole lot of fried food and most of the breadings, whether it's fried pickles or okra or calamari or shrimp, are the same across all of that. The batter is fine, but it gets wearing. The coconut shrimp and hush puppies were definitely overcooked, which was kind of disappointing. Coke Zero on tap, but the mix could be better. For the price, it is also worth nothing there is a ton of food here, definitely quantity over quality. D\u00e9cor is pretty cool and this is parked right along the Boise river, though it's a bit tucked away and has to be more or less sought out...probably worth hitting at least once, but there are far better local places that are more worthy of attention.",

    "text": "Worn down signs intrigue me.  I had biked passed 16th Street Seafood a ton of times, always wondering what was going on inside.  Now I know the answer, and the answer is- not much. At least in terms of decor. There is a gumball machine, 2 empty candy machines, plus a counter to order at and that's pretty much it. Also absent was the plethora of seafood over ice you would hope to see at a place specializing in seafood. There were some frozen crab cakes, breaded fish fillets, clams, and crabs- but not else. Still, I threw caution to the winds of Tasker Street and put in an order.\n\nI didn't want to go for fried seafood, so the sandwiches and platters were out.\n\nI got a large order of mussels in butter and garlic sauce ($9.50). Mussels are one of those things I like making at home, but it is way too hot for that right now. . My main complaint is that the order came with an unacceptable amount of closed shells - 9!   It was still a good sized order with a big piece of bread to dip in the unexpectedly spicy, broth. As the place is to-go only- they know how to wrap up messy seafood orders, nothing was spilled.\n\nRemember when I said I didn't want anything fried, well that's not ever actually true. So I ended up sneaking in 2 fried shrimps. Not bad, but not worth $1.25 each.",

We had many options on the type of milk and sweetener is available. They had limited food items available being mostly donuts this morning. We opted for a piece of the vegan banana bread to share. Iced coffee came out quickly and are banana bread and we went outside to sit with and realize there is no area connected to this restaurant for outdoor seating. The restaurant next-door however was not yet open so we sat at one of their tables thinking no one would mind. It would be nice if the coffee house itself had its own outdoor seating. Are iced coffee was very good and hit the spot. The vegan banana bread was good but seemed very dense to me. I'll be back another time to try some more of the fancy coffee they have available here. I'm hoping that they will add to the food menu as well as a try to not eat donuts most days. Maybe a breakfast sandwich or some other option than a pastry would be good.",

From the limited menu, I picked the Penne Fellini, which has prosciutto di parma, peas, onions, and light cream sauce. The whole dish was literally this pasta swimming in sauce. It may have had a light cream flavor, but it was ladled heavily onto the pasta. I didn't have a desire to consume an entire meal of this, so I ended up not finishing.\n\nIt was a fun celebration, and we were really there for the friends and family, not the food. Oh, and we also had the bruschetta and salad, neither of which was very memorable.

The special place Cactus holds in my heart is for one thing: Margarita Mondays.\n\nI walked in to Cactus this Monday with a friend from work, and the bartender had a pitcher of 'ritas going before we even sat down. Point to Cactus: The staff is on top of stuff for their regular customers.\n\nThe service can be a little slow at times, but once we get a table full of margarita pitchers life is beautiful. The 'ritas themselves aren't the most consistent (this week's were a little heavy on the juice) but for $10 I'm not complaining. And, to reply to one of the posts, they definitely don't skimp on the tequila. In fact, the bartender measures out the liquor for ever pitcher. Margaritas are pretty sweet so you can't taste it too much, and I'm sure it isn't quite as much as you'd get in a non-special, but believe me it's there.\n\nMy most serious gripe, actually, is the music. Don't know who puts the mixes on, but I protest. They actually played 'Closing Time' the other night - at 10:00, when people were still coming in. Way to send the wrong message.\n\nIt's not the best place around by any stretch, but if you ever need to unwind after a long Monday, you'll find me at Cactus.",

But at least we worked up an appetite, right?\n\nOrdered the Lobster Risotto w/ shrimp and lobster. There was about 3 pieces of lobster total in the dish, but the taste was well rounded and creamy. It was filling, adequately satisfying and nothing special.\n\nWhat saved this from being a 2-star review was the fact that I tried my friend's Straw and Hay, which was stellar. The toasted ravioli is also one-of-a-kind: not a cheese bomb like other places and extremely balanced in taste. They weren't stingy with the filling, either. I'd probably have to come back and try other dishes, but all in all, I was salty about the waiting time.",

I don't understand a Margaritaville in Nashville but I also am probably not the actual target demographic of these places...see: my dad who sometimes makes me think he can't find anything else on his XM radio other than Margaritaville. \n\nSo we've of course been to the one in the Caymans and on Key West. Since clearly these are out of the way places, I didn't get in the way of my parents having their experience here. \n\nI was kind of hoping to avoid listening to music...or at least if I was going to have to listen to covers, NOT \"Call Me Maybe\" gone country. It's somewhat loud in here and I imagine as the night goes on it's louder. We were here prior to a hockey game but it was still pretty busy. \n\nSince I procured my family a free app coupon I decided I was worthy of the 5 o'clock somewhere which is a take on a Hurricane, which somehow in five years of legal drinking I have never had before. It wasn't bad. I imagine it's one of those things where you're like \"oh this barely tastes like alcohol, I'll have another\" and then suddenly you're hitting on someone you shouldn't be hitting on. Wait what.\n\nFor that free app, we had the spinach artichoke dip. It wasn't bad, I certainly wouldn't have let anyone pay full price for it though. \n\nI wasn't feeling like having a full on sandwich or anything but there aren't really any smaller sized options. I guess a cup of soup but I had had soup for lunch and it was like obscenely hot for December so that was out of the question. I decided to just get the chicken quesadilla app and if I didn't finish it then whatever. The rest of my family had burgers or a chicken sandwich. The burgers were liked all around, although my brother got the diablo one and complained that it wasn't spicy enough. But I don't think he understands that poblanos aren't that hot.\n\nThe quesadilla wasn't bad, there were some spots though where the chicken was a bit tough. Nothing you can't fix with a good bit of salsa though. \n\nEven though like I said it was pretty busy, we were there only about an hour. Service was great. Would I come back on my own? Probably not. In my case it's really one of those places where once is enough for the experience but if I were asked to come again, I wouldn't say no.",

We sat and waited, checking out their menu. The waitress/bartender came up and asked if we were ready to order, but since part of our party was missing, we asked if we could have a few minutes. Well, I guess a few minutes means twenty because our waitress sat at a table conversing with a couple instead of coming back to assist us. The whole place was rather dead, probably since it was the day before Thanksgiving. Finally, she came over to take our orders. She was helpful in telling us what to avoid on the menu. We got margaritas all around. I had a mango margarita (I tried it both on the rocks and blended) and it was absolutely delicious! I would return just for their fabulous Mango margarita. I heard both their strawberry and traditional margaritas were just as good as well! (Just a tip, avoid the banana margarita!) It took our waitress forever to check on us again and we ended up going up to the bar anytime we needed something. We didn't even think about ordering food, considering the service we were receiving wasn't ideal. The drinks were good and our waitress was polite, just not very attentive.

Not really knowing what to expect at the Marmont, we took a risk.  \n\nThe Good:\nI have to say that the NY strip steaks and rib eye were very very good and cooked perfectly (medium rare and medium).  They were about 1-1/2 thick (forgot to bring my calipers) and well trimmed; very little fat was left. I would say the meat was prime, not choice.  We all enjoyed them as well as the fries which were cooked crisply as we requested.  the sauces were meh; why cover up the wonderful taste of the beef?  Service was good, prompt, and polite.   \n\nThe Not So Good:\nThe decor is awful.  The floor looks like painted OSB with the paint half worn off, the tables are painted plywood, lighting from K-Mart, and walls have a few giant old signs hanging on them.  The place is a visual dive. I felt like I was in a Tom Waits song.  How hard would it be to make it a nice warm and inviting space? I don't get it.   Want to make more money? Spend the 5K, it will pay off. But please find someone who knows what they are doing.  You serve delicious steaks; I'll bet your decorator doesn't do the cooking, so why ask the cook to decorate?\n\nIf you want great steaks for a good price, go here.  But if you are looking for a classy or trendy setting too, you may need to pay the extra 30% at a high end steak house.",

I love good beer but I will drink it whether I think it is amazing or awful. I got 4 of their current seasonal beers in a sampler (batch 100, winter warmer, undead black IPA and paramount). They were decent, nothing to write home about or come back the next day for. The reason they lose points from last night was because of the food, not the beer.  Got a black and blue burger. It had just too much blue cheese on the burger and the meat was just alright and they also skimped on the fries. The price is steep for their higher end food but I think their entrees are very good and will stick with those for next time.\n\nP.S. For anyone looking to avoid big parties, babies and young kids (1-12 years old) I have always seen a big group of people who decide to bring their children with them. Kids never bother me but they are kids so they make noise and run around the restaurant. Not much you can do about it besides sitting at the bar.",

    "text": "I'm going to make the bold statement and say that I'm kind of an ice cream fanatic. Whenever I get ready for a trip, researching ice cream shops is at the top of my to-do list. I don't care if it's the dead of winter. You take coffee breaks? I take ice cream breaks. I realize that I take this obsession/addiction to an unhealthy extreme, as I've been known to eat it for dinner. \n\nWith that said, you can imagine that I was really excited to try this place since it is so highly rated on yelp. When reading the reviews, I was convinced that Creole Creamery was going to be the \"Bi-rite of the south\" (best ice cream I've ever had). I had some pretty high expectations. Unfortunately, it did not deliver quite like I thought it would but it certainly wasn't bad. \n\nMy main problem is that out of the 3 flavors I had, THEY ALL TASTED IDENTICAL. I got the Basil Coconut & Lavender and my sister got the Rose. These were some of the most unique flavors they offered and you'd think they'd be pretty distinguishable from one another. Alas, neither of us could taste much difference. The flavors were extremely subtle.\n\nWhat I did love however was the creaminess and texture. This is where it gets close to the Bi-Rite status. The ice cream itself is very rich and smooth with perfect consistency. You simply can't buy something like this in the store. Had the flavors wowed me, I would have given this 5 stars, hands down (and it truly would have become the \"Bi-Rite of the South\" in my book).\n\nAll in all, I will definitely go back. I mean, it's still great ice cream. And I'm sure if I tried a more traditional flavor, the taste would be stronger. I just really love the weird stuff :)",

    "text": "Fun fact, I \"recently\" moved somewhat close to the \"Hill\". In fact, on the day that I finally found my apartment, my parents and I were driving down the road and stumbled upon a building adorned with a big, red, flashing sign-it read, \"Joey B's on the Hill.\" Since we were famished from all of the decision making, we decided to give it a whirl.\n\nNow, Joey B's is not quite located in the same area as the rest of the Hill restaurants, so I was anxious to see what it was like-most of the others are sit down, semi-nice, lit by the light of 1,000 candles types of places. You know, your typical Italian joint--checkered table clothes and all.\n\nJoey B's was a little different as it looked a little more like a sports bar than most other places on the Hill--fewer candles, more big screen TVs. [Of course, my father was extraordinarily pleased that he could watch the Nascar race while we ate, so it was all good.]\n\nAfter looking over the menu, my mom decided to order the French Dip and my dad and I decided to split a pizza-half supreme, half BBQ chicken. That's half sausage, pepperoni, bacon, mushroom, green pepper & onion and half grilled chicken, red onion and provel cheese with BBQ sauce. Let's just be honest. This was a mistake. And the mistake was my fault. I was the one who ordered the BBQ half of the pizza and it just did not hold a candle to the \"regular\" half of the pizza.\n\nYes, I'll admit that for once in my life a pizza with provel cheese on it--impressed me. I didn't expect that! But, the BBQ pizza was too sweet and I'm sad to say that we didn't eat much of it.\n\nLuckily, my dad let me have a little of his and I was so glad he did, because his half of the pizza was much better than mine.\n\nThe pizza had a nice crunchy crust, but it didn't crumble and fall apart like some thin crusts can. Plus, the sauce was really good. Nice and tangy. In fact, I believe that the menu said that this was Rachel Ray's favorite pizza sauce--and who can argue with that?\n\nAll in all, it was just good pizza. No, not the *best* I'd ever had, but good. Plus, it was pretty BIG too-definitely enough to share. So either go in expecting left overs or take a BIG appetite.\n\nNow that we've talked pizza, let's talk about the [unexpected] best part of the meal. My mom's french dip sandwich.\n\nThin, juicy, sliced roast beef served with its own au jus and melted provel cheese on French bread. This sandwich was very moist and very flavorful. I would have to describe it as comfort food... to the point where I am seriously look forward to going there in the winter and having one.\n\nPlus, once again, I'm proud to say that I enjoyed the provel cheese on this dish! *gasp!* Maybe St. Louis is stealing my soul.... Or maybe Joey B's just knows how to use juuuustttt enough provel to bring the flavor palette in without overwhelming the taste buds. Yeah, I'll go with the second option.\n\nOther menu items that we selected included onion rings (very heavily breaded, but pretty good... your standard onion rings) and side salads (again, the provel cheese was good on these salads. Shocking!). It was all just very satisfying; a nice hearty, savory meal.\n\nSo, what's the final judgement? The food was good (and partially changed my mind about provel cheese), the service friendly, and the atmosphere upbeat but not super exciting. I'd have to grade Joey B's like this:\n\nFood: A-\nAtmosphere: B\nService: A\nPrice: $\nPortion Size: Large\n\nIt truly seemed like a great place to grab a pizza and a couple beers and hang out with your friends. I definitely plan on returning and you should check it out too. Let me know what you think when you go!\n\nHappy eating!",

The lady sitting next to me on the bench remarked how good my food smelled.\n\n Everything on the menu at Hip City Veg is vegan, though even if you are not vegan/vegetarian I would recommend it because the food tastes really good!\n\nI liked the Udon noodle salad with faux-chicken. I've also had the ziggy burger which I thought was pretty good for a veggie burger (loved the fresh tomato, lettuce and onion) but especially enjoyed the sweet potato fries I had as a side.\n\nThere are also some interesting drinks. There is a \"groothie\" which is a greens and fruit smoothie. Personally I thought it was just OK and not that thirst quenching, but it seemed like a lot of people were ordering it so I tried it.

We visited on a night when there weren't very crowded so it was nice to be able to have such an attentive waitress and service.  I was a bit disappointed when I didn't find as much on the menu as I would have liked to have seen that would appeal to me.  I guess I have become very picky with my Yelp addiction in terms of scrutinizing every establishment I go to pretty thoroughly.  \n\nI ordered the hummus appetizer for the table and was very pleased at the quality of the dish.  For my entree I ordered their Bricks Salad which had plenty of fresh produce packed in.  I ordered a double portion of chicken for it, which still seemed pretty skimpy especially since I was charged for that request.  Overall, I'd say this is probably one of Ybor's lesser known spots as its more on the western edge of the main strip, yet it seems very lively and upbeat.  I did like that they had featured lots of artwork by various local artists that were on display and offerred for sale.  Not a bad place to hang out and have a drink if you're looking for a lower key outing in the Ybor area.",

Lots of sausage in the gravy and a bit of pepper.  I gave it a try.  The sausage gravy was very tasty as was the orange juice.  I didn't enjoy the biscuits.  They were very hard and smothering them in gravy didn't help much.  I also thought this place deserved more than one dollar sign.  It was a bit pricy.  All in all, pretty good.",

    "text": "Hobnobber is close to my office, and the older male employees make a point to go here weekly. Possibly more than weekly. There really isn't a lot of variety around the 8000 block of Airline in Metairie. Hobnobber is somewhat close by on West Metairie Ave.\n\nAnyway, in the ~2 years that I've worked at my current job, I hadn't tried Hobnobber. I'm not really a seafood fan and their menu consists of a lot of seafood entrees. If you like seafood, this might be the place for you. I finally gave in and accompanied some co-workers last week. \n\nThey recommended the Italian entrees, if I wasn't in the mood for seafood. I opted for the eggplant parmesan. While I didn't have high expectations, it was really quite good. I've had better, mind you, but for a quick and reasonably priced lunch, it was nice. Plus, it's a convenient location (for me).\n\nIf you are in a hurry, you might want to call ahead and place an order to-go. It's a small space with limited seating, particularly at lunch. Also, if dining in, note that it's one of those places where you order at the counter, the server brings your food, and then you eat. They have a small, limited selection salad bar by the serve-yourself drink machine.\n\nOverall, I wouldn't make the trip here if I had more time for lunch. But, in a pinch, it's good homemade food at a good price.",

However, the service we received was atrocious.  I'd cut the woman some slack if I saw a doctor's note certifying that she was really mute, but she wasn't sharing.  Her response to us ordering was sighing and rolling her eyes.  WTF?  The good thing was,  I was not here to make friends.  I came here with one purpose in life - to slay a mighty roast beef n gravy Po Boy.  It was just what I wanted and more.  So good.  Sweet potato fries are bomb, too.  Good selection of Abita.  Hush puppies were whatever.  Kinda tasteless and underwhelming.  Bread pudding was amazing.  Overall, the food was a 4+, but the service brought my rating down.

    "text": "I guess I'm listed as a \"picky\" reviewer on Yelp, but this place could be 4 stars if they would address the service problems.\nWalked in at 7:30, gave the name and waited. Soon there were over a dozen people standing in the waiting area for tables. After 15 minutes the lady I gave my name to came over and asked what the name was again. I asked if we could sit at the 2 top that had been vacant since we walked in and she looked at the empty table and said sure. Ok, but why couldn't we be seated before that??? I do want to add that in between taking names, she was answering the phone, pouring coffee, ringing up checks and bussing tables. This place sorely needs a host or hostess. The couple that came in right behind us waited over 20 minutes to be seated, AND there was another 2 top open behind us. I don't get it. Anyway, the waiter came by, opened the wine and told us about the specials. I guess its picky if you want the wine opened and then given a few minutes to relax before hearing the specials. Anyway, another man came by several minutes later and asked if we were told the specials. We asked for a few minutes and he was very nice and said sure no problem. I will get to the food, but you have to read what else took place to understand why they need someone to co-ordinate the staff. A waitress brought the appetizers and when we were almost done, yet another waitress brought us bread with dipping sauce. Been nice to get the bread first. The dinner was brought out by a different waitress. At the end of the meal the a waitress brought by the dessert cart , which we passed on. The original waiter stopped by to ask about dessert, I said no thanks, but we would like the check. In between we kept trying to get someone's attention because we had asked to take part of an entree home. The waiter was way to busy and basically blew us off, one of the waitress' also passed by, but we couldn't get her to stop. Finally the man that seemed to be the manager came by and he took care of it.\nOk, that's the bad news and maybe they were shorthanded , but a lot of other Yelpers note the same problem with service issues. People shouldn't have to sit and wait 15-30 minutes for a table. If this wasn't BYO, then you could always go sit at a bar and have a drink. The other thing is, no one offered to open the wine while we were waiting,as many BYO's will do if they can't seat you on time. Nor, did anyone say sorry about the wait.\nThe food was very good, even as picky as I am. The shrimp tempura was serving of 5 very large gulf shrimp atop a very flavorful asain slaw. The duo, which consists of a crabcake slider and a sirloin slider was great. The crabcake was moist and had ample pieces of lump crabmeat. The sirloin slider was excellent, could of eaten a lot of those. The entree's were also top notch. The special Grouper with beans and crab was moist, cooked perfectly and had a nice red pepper sauce on the bottom.\nAs most of the reviews talk about here, the Lobster ravioli is as good as anywhere in this area. The pasta was light, the ravioli was stuffed with lobster meat and the sauce was great.\nLike I said, take care of the service and seating issues and this is a 4 star. They do have their own lot, but you probably will have to park across the street if it's a weened night. I was glad I put this address in the nav system because at night and the first time there it's a little hard to find.\nWill give them another try in hopes the service improves.",

The eel on the roll was minuscule and the roll was dominated by enormous pieces of cucumber. The tuna roll was better and topped with scallions and masago. The obligatory side of ginger (which I'm not sure is really necessary) was of the kind dyed red, completely unnatural. Ginger is pale yellow or tan colored. Cordial service by the only server but he seemed bored as did the chef behind the counter.  Might try again if I'm in the mood and in the area.",

The cucumber salad was delicious, so make sure you order that as your side - but admittedly it's a dish that's kind of hard to screw up. The wrap I got tasted okay, but it tasted like it was made in a microwave (not sure, maybe it was). In general the food reminded me of a mediterranean version of Panera. I don't like Panera either, so if you think the food there is awesome maybe you will like this place more than I did. The best way I can think to describe it is like the food you might get on a fancy mediterranean airline. It was edible and had some nice flavors, but just wasn't great.

I read through a few of the reviews before going and wasn't surprised that they were out of the fried chicken when I got there.  I wasn't planning on ordering it anyway but someone in my group tried to.  \n\nI ended up going with the lamb patty melt and while it was good...it wasn't great.  I love having an egg on my sandwich so that was a highlight.  The lamb wasn't that great and it tasted like they combined the lamb meat with some sort of sausage but it don't state so on the menu.   The french fries were good but nothing special.  The lamb stew was the other item I was considering getting so maybe it would be worth going back and trying that.  \n\nIf you're a vegetarian you probably want to avoid this place all together because it's not very veggie friendly.  And don't think you can go and order something (like the waffle) without the bacon because your requests for revisions will be \"politely declined\" as it states on the menu.   I like that they tell you ahead of time but it doesn't seem like it would be a terrible thing to request that the cook doesn't sprinkle the bacon on top of the waffle. \n\nThey do have some very interesting drinks and I would consider going there to grab a coffee because the process for coffee seemed to be quite intricate.  \n\nI will say that the their menu has changed since they opened and a lot of what was mentioned in previous reviews is no longer on the menu.",

The brunch offerings, however, were not so impressive. At $26pp, a waffle station would have been nice. Or pancakes. If you wanted eggs, you had to wait at the omelet station. A type of breakfast meat other than pork bacon would have been good also, e.g. turkey sausage, turkey bacon. The vodka penne, chicken francaise, potatoes and green beans were all lacking in flavor.  The cookies and other dessert items were not worth the calories or fat content.",

    "text": "Well, Chatham Tap is about as inoffensive as a bar can be. It doesn't overwhelm you with the TeeVees like a lot of sports bars (there's just one giant screen behind the bar). The atmosphere is cozy but there's still decent seating, the staff is friendly and the menu is even a little out there for pub food--gouda melted over apples on ciabatta? Hmm.... I had an apple, candied walnut and feta salad. Don't be fooled by the fact that it's called \"salad\"--it was more like dessert. They could lay off the candied walnuts and raspberry dressing a bit and this would be a lot better and healthier option. I tried my companion's pesto and mushroom sandwich and it was quite good (probably not healthy either). The thick spicy chips were yummy (possibly homemade?). I guess most people don't go to bars to get healthful food, but I sometimes like to mitigate the beer calories by choosing the less fatty-sounding pub fare. I think Old Point may be a better option for those situations.\n\nAnd, regarding beer.... I drank London Pride, which was decent. I'm not really wowed by places that have Boddington's and Fat Tire on tap--these are mass-produced and -distributed beer, people! That said, it's better than Bud or Coors. \n\nOverall, Chatham is a decent bar. I can see why some might be more smitten than I was--it manages to offer a bit more than your generic pub experience and that can go a long way in Indy. If you're a football (soccer) fan you might also give this place extra points. But for me there wasn't really anything special to grab on to.",

We got a special appetizer - Italian Empanada...Sounds weird, but it was very flaky, delicious party in a slightly spicy marinara. Very delicious. My main entre was the beef osso bucco. The meat was delicious, but don't expect any bone marrow with this dish. My girlfriend ordered a fettucine special which was ok.

I really liked the ambiance and feel in the bar area and a small seating area connecting to the main dining area. For some reason, I wasn't feeling it in the main dining area (where we sat). I guess that's the idea and maybe we should have asked to sit in a different area. Part of it may have to do with the fact that we were the youngest people in the place by about 40 years. We could hear the commotion in the kitchen, which was weird because it didn't seem like we were that close to it. Next time I would request to be seated elsewhere.\nService-\nOur waitress was alright, she just seemed a little out of place. She broke a dish on the floor, and overall was a bit sloppy. She was nice enough though, and checked on us an adequate amount. \nFood- \nI loved the fact that there was the option to order petite serving, which upon arrival to our table seemed laughable. But once I started eating, it was the perfect amount of food! I ordered the Cedar Plank Salmon and my husband ordered the Crab Cakes. My salmon was delicious and crab cakes decent. However, our sides were just OK. Also my husband's salad seemed straight out of a bag. We were pleasantly surprised at the end of the meal when our server brought us 2 mini chocolate fudge cookies. Mmmmm! The perfect end to the meal!\n\nI might try this place again for drinks/appetizers or I could see a mother's day brunch here, but overall our dining experience wasn't that memorable. Maybe we will give it another try, because I really want to like this place!",

Other than that, it was good, and everyone else seemed content with their meal.  Our server was attentive and patient, and all our meals were served at the same time, eliminating that awkward \"waiting\" stage that often happens with larger parties.\n\nHowever, there was bad news - the children's meal no longer includes a dessert of Dirt and Worms, which (as silly as it may seem) has always been the main attraction of Tony Roma's if kids are along.   We had to pay an extra dollar for a small scoop of freezer-burned vanilla ice cream which neither child finished, nor any adult wanted to eat because of the crystallization of it.  It's funny how Dirt and Worms has become a tradition for us, and the meal didn't seem complete without it.  Hey, Tony, you may have lost some customers over that pudding and cookie crumbs and gummy worm \"cost-cutting\" elimination.  Others may value you for your ribs, but for us it was the giggles over chocolate-covered faces that made us leave with a smile on our faces.",

The food and drinks were all pretty good but the one thing that would make me not come back to this restaurant are the overly high chairs and tables. My entire party had to literally climb up into the chairs and then you feel like you are jumping down when you had to get out of the chair. At one point one person in our party went to the restroom and came back and stood the rest of the time because they said it was too hard to get back into the high chair. These were handmade and the person who made them neglected to use proper height measurements for high top tables and chairs. They are a safety hazzard.",

You walk through a wine shop and can buy your own bottles and cheese. You choose your sizes and cheese types from their fridge.  Then you go into a cool backyard patio area where there is a live band and pick a seat. For food, there is a small window to order from which is CASH ONLY.  The food is ok. It's not the best of NOLA but it is tasty.  The portion sizes are very good for the price.\n\nI'd definitely come back for ambiance, wine and cheese but maybe not a full meal.",

    "text": "It was a pretty cute little restaurant; the atmosphere was definitely \"neighborhood pub.\"  We had a very nice (very obviously not Ethiopian) waitress with multiple visible piercings.  She was (*gasp* ) very attentive for an Ethiopian restaurant waitress.  The service was not as good quick as the average non-Ethiopian restaurant, but it definitely blew all the Ethiopian restaurant services away with the speed!  Gee, I wonder if it could be because she's not Ethiopian?!?!?!  hahaha  However, she did mention that she grew up in West Philly eating Ethiopian food.  mmmm I'm jealous!  \n\nAs is my custom, I went to use the bathroom and wash my hands before the meal.  Considering that Ethiopian food is eaten with one's hands, I would highly recommend this practice to all my friends .  There were two \"stalls\" in the bathroom.  Both stalls have saloon styled doors (2 halves swinging freely in the middled, hinged on either side).  The first one was lit, but the right half of the door was missing.  Given this, I opted for the second stall.  After stepping inside, I noticed a good 2 inches between the halves of the door.  Needless to say, I did my business in a hurry all the while praying that no one else would come in.  PLEASE LADIES, GO TO THE BATHROOM BEFORE EATING AT THIS RESTAURANT.  It is a harrowing experience!\n\nWhen the food came (sooner than expected), the portions were fairly generous.  When I bit into the injera at the Queen of Sheba, I was pleasantly surprised.  It was fairly sour!  It was not as sour as Abyssinia's injera, but definitely a few steps more sour than anywhere else I have tried up to date.  Now, I'm not saying ideal injera should be sour, but I like mine that way.   hahaha  Unfortunately parts of the injera were a little dried.  *sigh*   It's a toss up for me between dried injera versus more sour injera.   \n\nThe dishes were all decent, but not amazing.  My companion liked the potatoes in the carrot, string bean, potato dish.  I thought their salad was fabulous - fresh and dressed perfectly.  I did not care for the raw onions, but have to admit the taste was a nice contrast to the other dishes.  Both lentil dishes were decent, as I have said before it is difficult for me to tell much of a difference in them.  However, my trusty sidekick noted that the lentils were more watery at Kaffa Crossing.  I know that 1 of the lentil dishes was too spicy for me, but I am a big, Big wuss when it comes to spices, so that is neither here nor there.   The lamb was a big disappointment, it was a little sour (bad?).  The collard greens were pretty standard, nothing amazing.",

Love the creativity of the door handle being a rolling pin, the light fixtures as wire whip mixers, and incorporating the love sign into a beautiful center piece for the top back wall. Everything was very artsy and creative. I noticed the bright displays of cupcakes and assorted treats and most of all, the gorgeously decorated occasion cakes (HINT HINT: weddings are their specialty). They blew me away! It's like something you'd only see on TV! \n\nWe couldn't resist ordering their uniquely flavored cupcakes. Chocolate cake with raspberry icing and lavender something with pistachio icing. Plus, if you find a purple center in your cupcake, you can get another one for free. (Definitely NOT a marketing scheme, but I admire the game even though we're being played.)\n\nTo get to the point: the first thing I tried was the icing.. it was literally so hard I had to dig my teeth into it to get a bite. I feel like I would've like it if it was softer and more like icing? The chocolate cake was like any other. My fianc\u00e9e's cupcake was strange!! The icing literally tasted like stale, natural butter (or maybe more closely similar to lard!? If you ever tasted lard, you'll know that distinct flavor it has.) The icing was also hard as a rock. However, the lavender mixed (don't know what with) cake wasn't half bad, though nothing stood out to me as special.\n\nIffy on whether or not we'll be back. I want to like this place, but that just might be the pastry enthusiast in me talking.",

The lunch prices are great, most meals average around $10.

Which consisted of grilled chicken, portobello mushrooms, spinach and provolone. When I think of a panini, I picture a sandwich all melted together with grill marks on the sides of the bread. This was more of just a normal sandwich on nice thick bread. It also came with lettuce, tomato and onions on it, which I was not aware came with the panini. The sandwich tasted good, just not what I had expected. It came with a side salad (great honey mustard dressing) and homemade chips (favorite part of my meal).  I left full and satisfied.

    "text": "I really want to love this place, but they make it so hard. The past three times in a row I've been there, there has been some sort of ridiculous customer service issue that left me and whoever I was with super annoyed.\n\nStarting with the good: the coffee is delicious. The assortment of baked goods is great...quiche is yummy, etc. I've always loved the space...good mixture of comfy couches and real seating where people can sit and work on laptops. Plenty of outdoor seating on nice days.\n\nThe prices are...steep. BUT I always feel good about supporting a local small business, so whatever. My real problem is the 'tude and just general lack of professionalism that I've seen from the baristas. They clearly know their coffee, and that's great, but here are some of the more ridiculous things that have happened to me there in the past month:\n\n--purchased coffee with my mom and went to add our cream and sugar. My mom realized the half and half container was empty and gave the guy behind the counter a head's up. His answer: \"Yeah, we're actually out of half and half.\" Everyone stared blankly at him, including the other people in line. Now mind you, it was before noon, not five minutes before they closed. No apology, no \"I'm so sorry, we sent someone down the street to the 7-11 (literally down the street) to pick some up, they should be back any minute.\" That was it. The guy behind us asked, \"is anyone going to get some more?\" and the kid literally shrugged his shoulders and turned his back to us. Ummmmmm. As my mom said, when you charge people $8 for two coffees (one of which was just a drip coffee), I don't think it's too much to ask that you provide HALF AND HALF AT YOUR COFFEE SHOP. \n\n--another time I was there, a friend asked for her coffee extra hot, and then when it arrived just warm, she asked if they could nuke it in the microwave for a minute. She was very nice about it. The girl behind the counter, on the other hand, felt it necessary to explain in a condescending tone for five minutes that they \"actually can't put the coffee cups in the microwave\" for some reason I now forget, and then reluctantly offered to add some hot water. Uhhhh. Homegirl. Could you maybe just take the coffee and solve the problem? Put it in a to go cup and microwave it? This doesn't seem like THAT hard of a problem to solve, nor can I imagine it's the first time someone has asked for their coffee extra hot. Again, everyone in line sort of looked at each other helplessly as this happened. \n\n--this is a small thing, but they have multiple sizes for every drink on their board, but then half of them apparently only come in one size? I know it's a small issue, but you'd think it would occur to someone to change the menu so they don't have to keep telling people (last time I was there it happened to both me and the woman behind me). \n\nJersey Java owners, please give your baristas some basic lessons in customer service. Again, they know their coffee, and they're generally nice until there's ANY sort of minor hiccup, and then all basic common sense goes right out the window. Your coffee is too expensive for me to have some ordeal every time I go there. Oh, and buy more half and half.",

Whether your here on pleasure or work there is no better place to start your day than Dots Diner. \n\nTruth in dining leads me to report a less than favorable experience after a string of very good ones.  This morning I arrived at 5:30 am as usual and to be honest it was not the same staff that I had seen for the previous two weeks. \n\nAfter sitting in acknowledged for seven minutes I left and drove up the street where I had a fantastic experience.  \n\nIt's good to be great but there is something to be said for consistency too.  I won't let one underwhelming experience get me too down on Dots.",

The service was really good and the drinks are pretty awesome. But if you're looking for authentic barbecue at average/market price, this isn't it. This is more of a barbecue style of their own and it's pricey. It has a cool location, and the service is friendly and prompt.",

I ordered a smoothy and my wife ordered a latte and a parfait. The parfaits are premade and quite good. The latte came out just as she was finishing her parfait (5 minutes ish), I continued to wait at least a couple of more minutes for my smoothy. I could have made it faster at home. When I did get it, it was not worth the wait. There was far too much ice... They give you a wide slurpy straw to make up for the increased ice volume, it's just not the consistency I like and had very little flavour because if the high ice volume.\n\nIt's nice to see a healthy option place in my new neighbourhood, but I hope that they vastly improve their service and quality.",

I wish they had more savoury pastries, actually I wish they had more stuff in general and maybe sometimes change it up a bit. \n\nI had in the past gotten used to a routine of getting up in the morning, grabbing a coffee and a pastry to eat before work. Later on in the day I would grab a loaf of bread that I would bring home to eat with dinner or as a snack for breakfast. I wish the bakery was open later, but unfortunately, none of the bakeries in New Orleans are open late, and by late, I mean past 1 or 2 pm. \n\nThat being said, the pastries and sweets are very good when they are fresh and I would give this place more stars if it wasn't for unpleasant experiences with some of the workers. I have been frequenting Maple Street Patisserie for over a year now and on several occasions I have been treated very rudely by the workers who are frequently impatient, even when there's no one else in the store, or they act angry as they take the pastry out of the window and shove it onto the plate.  At other times, the workers are actually pretty nice.  So please, if you're having a bad day, don't take it out on the customers.\n\nIf you want coffee, I would go across the street to Starbucks or down the road to PJ's, but if you don't mind average coffee then you can stick to the bakery.",

    "text": "Been here a few times over the years, mainly when I'm at the hotel for an event. As far as hotel connected restaurants go, this place isn't too bad at all. They have a very nice setup, with sections far enough apart so that the restaurant isn't overly loud when the bar is busy. The staff are usually very friendly, and keep your drinks filled. The place has a great atmosphere and can be a good spot to catch a ball game. Some of there specials are tempting, especially when they have half priced starters.\n\nThe food here is about what you would expect. Efficient, hot, served quickly but nothing that will knock your socks off. I'd recommend the burgers and just about any of the fried dishes. Most of the starters are good, especially the wings. The BBQ is passable, but nothing to get excited for. Certainly aren't many good alternatives for BBQ in the area, so this place could definitely do the trick. Just please beware that if you're dining with a large party, your BBQ will likely be a bit on the dry side by the time it comes out, happened on multiple occasions. If you're there with just one or two other people, then you won't have to worry.\n\nBottom line is that if you're staying at the Holiday Inn that this is connected to, you can get a decent meal, some good drinks with a nice atmosphere. Good without being great, but never slid into bad territory. I'd probably lean closer to 3.5 Stars, but not higher than that.",

The tacos were great, especially the handmade tortillas and the carne asada.  Poblano cilantro rice sounded wonderful but turned out to be very meh.

And boy does this place get crowded. The parking lot is not small, yet it seemed to be overflowing on my last visit for a Thursday happy hour. \n\nWhile the booths felt big and open they also were not very private. There was a family nearby so I had to be careful to watch my language. I snacked on stuffed olives and deviled eggs. Did not get a full meal. Drank a tall Budweiser, and overall had fun with friends. I do prefer sports bars with a less corporate feel, something more like Ferg's is downtown St. Pete. The menu did look fascinating, and while the food was not too expensive, it did seem a bit pricy for being bar food.\n\nOverall this is a decent sport bar and everything was A-OK. My snacks were good, service was a tad bit slow, but understandable with how crowded it was. Not going to be chompin' at the bit to come back, but I would not object to giving this place another shot!",

We were a party of 6, so they sent over two servers to take our order. Both servers nodded and said that they understood when I said that I had a dairy allergy and couldn't have any on my food. We asked for one order of chips and salsa for the table (REALLY overpriced)\nMy dish arrived, smothered in cream sauce. I asked to see the owner and explained it all to him, and he apologized and brought out another plate, 20 minutes later.\nWhen we got the check, we found that they had brought us THREE orders of chips and salsa, with 3 orders of guac, which we didn't ask for- they saw three couples and decided to up the order on their own. \n\nOverall, if you have allergies, I'd say stay away from this place due to the language barrier.

I felt this was a place I could bring any of my friends and family because everyone would find something they liked...and I could still indulge in my turkish favorites.\n+The appetizer/small plate list is interesting and the perfect price. Arancini was delicious.  \n+Accessible wine list.  Bottles were largely $30 or under.  I'm no wine expert but I really enjoyed the pinot noir they had.  \n+ I was not expecting the food to be so well plated at this price point.  Felt fancier than what we were paying.  \n+ My husband really enjoyed the Imam Bayildi\n+ Great HH specials advertised (we did not partake) \n\nNeeds Improvement:\n- My kofte was a bit dry.  If I hadn't gone to Aya Sofia 2 weeks prior, I might've been thrilled just to have the option...but I was still a little disappointed.  It was well seasoned which helped make up for the dryness. \n- It seemed like every single person in this place was involved in serving us.

Surprising since it was a busy, holiday weekend so you'd think they be turning out lots of fresh pork instead of a product that tasted like it had been sitting under a dry heat lamp for hours. However, wings were pretty darn tasty. A touch under done but worth coming back for. Ribs and pork are dead to me though.\n\nThe biggest disappointment about our recent visit was the way the \"wait in line, order, get your number and sit down\" process soooo doesn't work at this place. To be fair, it's not Mr. Edley's fault that the douchebag hipsters and self absorbed yuppie parents don't have enough common sense or courtesy to not sit down before they've ordered and obtained a number but seriously, PUT UP SOME SIGNS or have the bus people and manager politely ask people who have rudely tied up a table (or 3) while their party waits to get up. When I suggested to the cashier that they might have an issue this past Saturday, she said they \"don't allow that\" but then nobody told the family of 8 who committed this major foul to get up while we looked around for a place to sit (after ordering, of course). \n\nMy thoughts for Edley's 1) your food quality is slipping 2) your customers apparently need to be taught that sitting down before ordering throws the whole balance of your system off--find a way to tell them.\n\nP.S. If you're a party of 10 and looking to sit together on their patio on a busy night, go somewhere else unless you're prepared to respect the system and try your luck for a table...AFTER YOU'VE ORDERED!",

Cold brew costs $3,25!!!  ... that is more expensive then Starbucks charges for plain black coffee ... again coffee is ok . They charging $1.75 for ONE plain donut and $2.75 for \"fancy\" donuts .... way too overpriced for a donut joint ! And the atmosphere and cleaning of the shop is not aligned with the prices they charge !",

When you're in the moody for typical Chinese take out now you can look no further than capital beer. \n\nWe ordered egg rolls, veggie fried rice, Kung pao chicken, and beef Szechuan. Egg rolls were ON POINT. Perfectly fried and crispy. Fried rice was pretty standard and both of the entrees were nicely spiced and pretty much what one would expect from a Chinese takeout place. \n\nWe took out our food but the restaurant looked clean and inviting. We will definitely come back and try the sushi!",

Don't get me wrong, your food was decent- the Crudo was tasty and the rotolo was great but I guess the hype prior to meeting you was just a bit oversold. \n\nService: Meh. everyone there seemed really bored and the vibe was a bit bland. \n\nSeating: I sat at the counter because I dislike communal seating unless I'm at a bar. I recommend this option if you don't want to sit near someone else's hangry toddler or if you just want to watch the pizza making magic.\n\nFood: Decent. The pizza (I got the Crudo) was good and rotolo was really good but my pizza was a bit too oily and was barely warm. Other then that, the thin crust style pizza was well executed and all of the ingredients were fresh. The prosciutto wasn't overly salty and the sauce was lovely.\n\nI will probably go back soon to try a bit more from the menu since there were a lot of things that were appealing like the Melanzana and Salsiccia pizzas or the Nutella Pizza for dessert, yum.  \n\nTo be continued...",

The wings are fried, and then soaked in sauce. To me, I wouldn't even call it sauce on most of them. It was more like oil, grease or the like. They didn't taste too bad. The parmesan wings didn't taste as good as they looked, but it was so-so for me. On my three visits there, I had the ten wings combo (with fries and drink). The supposedly hot wings weren't as spicy (sorry guys I've had better...). The crinkle cut fries were alright as well. I did use them to dip into the leftover wing sauce on the plate. Which brings me to a point: this is probably the first wing place that I visited that doesn't offer dipping sauce (like ranch and blue-cheese). But I got by. Plus I had the blasting Top 40 music to keep me less bored. All in all, it was A-OK.",

We wandered in because we couldn't find anywhere else. \n\nIt's unclear how you're supposed to find a table, but customers are just supposed to grab a table. There's a sort-of line that forms by the bar, but no one working there organizes it at all.\n\nWe sat down quickly, but I think it was just lucky timing because for the rest of our meal people were waiting to sit. Also, there's only one bathroom and it took FOREVER to use it. They seriously need to have more than just one bathroom.\n\nI ordered the crab cakes florentine, which were really good. The potatoes needed more spice (aka hot sauce) but the meal was really flavorful. The chef cooked the eggs perfectly, but there was nothing to scoop up the runny egg with since there was no bread. My friend ordered the french toast and it was not impressive. Just a few slices of bread with cinnamon and some egg on top. Not filling or visually stunning. \n\nOur waitress was not particularly nice and seemed angry with us when we didn't want to order drinks. Many people did seem to have their food and then get a drink to-go as they walked around Jackson Square. \n\nI'd say you should go here if you're really hungry and can't find anywhere else. But otherwise, skip it and do the research for a better place.",

The waiter was friendly and helpful, but service was slow and our food took a long time to come out. \n\nThe decor is a tad nicer than your average sports bar, but the layout is fractured into several small compartments and they have flat screen TVs galore, but they are not positioned in a way that most of the seated folks can comfortably watch the game. \n\nThe menu consists of standard pizza, salad, sandwiches and pasta fare.  My lunch partner ordered a burger and liked it. I ordered the tutto mare and was disappointed. It was slopped in the bowl, drowning in sauce and too rich to eat more than a few bites. The clam flavor was strong and overpowered the remainder of ingredients. My salad was soggy and too sweet. I know that local Italian salads have a tendency to be sweet, but this one was seriously over the top. Prices were a little high for the quality of food. \n\nOverall, my experience was just OK. I will go back if others invite me, but I won't go out of my way to eat here. \n\nBTW, I'm getting bored with the argument about provel cheese. It is a local favorite. Every area around the country has a \"cheese\" that's typically used, and here it is provel. Giving a restaurant 1-star because they serve a local favorite is ridiculous. Also, just because you've \"been around\" doesn't mean you are a cheese expert. I've been around the world and most of the states in this great country and the argument can be made that most of the cheese available today isn't real. If you don't like it, don't eat it.",

My sister ordered a drink off the menu and 10+min later, as we're finishing our lunch, the waitress comes back and says \"sorry, our bartender doesn't know how to make that\" ..... So the bartender doesn't know how to make the drinks listed on the menu? And the 10+mins. it took to tell us that, it could have ben googled and made. I don't want to bash this establishment, but the customer service has always been an issue here.

    "text": "Eh. As others were saying, the design is pretty bad. It took an hour to get out of the parking garage. Elevators take forever, so we took the stairs, just to be greeted by a locked door.\n\nI'm sure there are varying opinions on this, but I'm in the boat with the people saying I thought D&B was Chuck E Cheese for adults. Little kids everywhere. I don't mind gaming with teenagers, but there were probably 100 toddlers in this place. There's people with strollers taking their infants. People, please go to Chuck E Cheese.\n\nI guess there's an any-age policy at the whole chain, it's just not what I was expecting. If anything, they should make it adults-only (or at least 13+) on weekdays and maybe open it up to all on weekends. I know that banning kids would cut into their customer base, but this makes older people not want to go, so pick your poison. I thought adults were the target market but that's not even close to the truth.\n\nAs far as the games, I didn't see anything for more than two players. I don't know how arcade games have evolved in the past 20 years, but way back in the day you could play some with four. \n\nThe best I saw was a downhill ski racing game, where you stand on it and steer with your feet. Cold air in your face for added effect. \nThe Walking Dead game was pretty cool. Kind of weird to have a crossbow that you reload instantly with 8 shots at a time. ....but I guess they're not going for realism in a zombie game. It's just a license for marketing, it's a generic zombie game. No show or comic characters. I don't care either way, it's not a bad game.\nThere's a racing game that takes a picture of your face before the race, and is connected to other machines at other locations. My friend and I were in tears laughing at this, since we would pick out a victim at the start of the race and try to ruin their day by running them off the road and making sure they lose. We just picked whoever looked most likely to cry.\n\nThere are plenty of bad games to make up for the good ones, but overall I actually had fun. Not sure if I'll be returning unless I find time to go when school is in session. However, I guess that wouldn't stop two year-olds from being there.",

My brother had the porterhouse. I tried the seafood special - prawns stuffed with crab and grilled. There really wasn't anything \"special\" about my meal or the risotto it was served with. Both were bland. My bad I suppose for ordering seafood in a restaurant known for steaks, although my brother's medium steak came out practically bleeding and was sent back for a second round on the grill. \n\nOne positive... the toasted ravioli.

Anyway, after my initial shock and disappointment when I opened the container, I started digging into the chicken.  Portions are very big, and the chicken fell off the bone and was juicy.  I love Jamaican food and get the cuisine in any city I visit, so I was a bit disappointed by their chicken.  It wasn't bad, just not very flavorful or memorable.  Collard greens and cabbage (ugh) were the same story.  For $8 plus tip, I was expecting something much more, especially after all the great reviews. I did notice the customers ahead of me ordered chicken wings, so maybe I'll try that the next time.  \n\nI can't imagine a worst place to be then in a food truck during a heat wave, so I will say that the service was very friendly by the lady.",

We waited over an hour and a half for food and asked to speak with a manger maybe 20 times during the entire experience, needless to say he never came over. Jen and Marcus handled everything perfectly, which is the only reason I'm rating this place 3 stars. It was happy hour and they kept us entertained and in good spirits while we waited forever to eat. When the food finally arrived everything was delicious. Marcus recommended The Johnny with fettuccine Alfredo and it was excellent. My wife also enjoyed the Johnny Rocco salad. We would definitely dine here regularly once all of the kinks are worked out but management needs to realize that this is New Orleans there are plenty of place to enjoy good food.

I liked the lavender taste, but the extreme sweetness ruined it. It was still too sweet after I diluted it with water, so I threw the drink away.  The croissants were okay (too dense for my taste). They had good flavor, and somehow tasted better the day after. I liked the stuffing of the spinach feta croissant, but the croissant itself was too dense and not buttery. The ham and cheese croissant was delicious. The Nutella croissant was okay (good flavor but the croissant was hard and didn't have enough filling). The butter croissant was too dense with texture more like a bread roll rather than a flaky croissant. The almond croissant lacked flavor.\n\nIn the past, I've ordered a green tea latte (that I hated- it just wasn't a flavor that fit my preferences) and a mocha (that was good).",

It's changed considerably.  i don't know if the food quality dropped with the economy, but even their burgers are failing.  The only thing i recently had there with which i was impressed was sauteed swiss char with almonds and cranberries.  (It was really well cooked with no bitter and all the flavor, just like char is supposed to taste).  Their oysters are good if you're lucky enough to get there on a west coast day, but even then, they seem to get the small batches.  \nA real regret is that whatever bartender made me fall in love with the old fashioned has since wandered into a place of cheap watered down bourbon and cloying bitters.  A real shame for a bourbon cherry to go bad in a drink like that.  \nOh, and who took the doughnuts?  Really?  Of all the dessert items, you took the homemade doughnuts with chocolate dipping sauce?  For shame!\nI'm hoping that as the winter rolls closer, we'll see the meatloaf again, with mushy peas, and mashed potatoes like a good simple urban hipster bar should class up.  For now, meh on all fronts except the neat interior and pretty awesome wait staff.",

The waitress was very nice and really understood the menu. The salad and pizza were awesome. The portions were large and the price was reasonable.  I knew it was family owned so you never know what to expect. Sometimes family owned is like going to someone's house and eating in their kitchen.\nThe negatives? The draft beer tappers were broken and not fixed because too expensive according to staff. The toilet was leaking in the rest room. They had a bucket under it that only caught half the water leading to about an inch of standing water on the floor. We were the only people there for the hour we visited. The staff of about 5-6 who all appeared to be family hung out in the front watching TV.\nMy review. Incredible food at a good price with good service. I don't know why it's an empty restaurant on a Saturday evening. But like a family home/restaurant you take the chance of being a guest in their home that needs a little work and hanging out with family members. That's what a family restaurant is. I'll be back.",

Unfortunate for me the salsa sucked, I do not like chipotle flavored anything. The chips were homemade and fantastic. Had ceviche for an appetizer which was very good. Though couldn't eat it with salsa... Main course I was very excited about a poblano chile relleno, definitely my signature dish to try and this one sounded great with queso fresco spinach mushrooms in a spicy poblano. The poblano was not roasted enough, then the relleno was undercooked, and I'm not a fan of over cooking but this was notably too little. My partner in crime had fish tacos and said they were bland. On a plus, they had Dragoons beer on tap so we didn't have to endure Mexican beer. All in all presentation was good, staff was attentive, food needed more spice and flavor, ditch the chipotle salsa, or offer something else. If they offered a better salsa I would give a 4 star instead of 3.",

    "text": "So I finally have a chance to try this place out after reading many many positive reviews on Yelp and on Facebook. For a Tuesday morning, we waited about 20-30 minutes (No line at 12 pm). There were 3 of us and we all were so excited since it's our first time here. I ordered the Sweet Potato Pancakes with a side of hash brown. One of my friends ordered the Rash Berry Pancakes , which he complained was way too sweet. The other ordered Pig in the Blanket (pancake wrapped around a sausage), which she ended up eating the sausages only. The pancakes were very average and plain, definitely not as good as what people said it to be. Hash-browns were average also. Personally, I prefer hash-browns at Bongo Java. The portions are huge and I recommend sharing it with someone. \n\nFor that amount of waiting time and mediocre food, I wouldn't come back unless I'm around the area. Not worth waiting at all.\n\n2013/#42",

Unfortunately my sense of trying something new was unsuccessful because I didn't really like the meal. Every pasta I had tasted dry to me, like it needed more sauce. But the environment there is perfect and you feel amazing . Just wish they could work on the food a bit.",

    "text": "If you find yourself in Nashville's West End craving a dirty, local Tex Mex joint with cold beers this is the place for you.  The restaurant is located right across the street from Vandy and Vandy memorial hospital, so it's pretty busy for lunch and dinner. You order on a paper menu where you check boxes next to what you want to eat. Very Sushi like or Which-Wich style, but fun none the less. The prices are not listed, so order carefully or you'll have a $17.00 tab like I did.\n\nThe building is a dump. I'm serious. It's grunge and not the kind that was popular in the 90's. Celling tiles are about to fall due to water damage, dust collects on the fans and wall decor, the tables looks like they are from a yard sale, and this is all on purpose! \n\nThe food is OK. Nothing to rave about. It's a local hole in the wall with descent food and homemade soft corn tortillas. The tortillas are great, but the rest of the food you're eating is a scale above taco bell. \n\nI'm giving the place a 3 due to the fact that they are accomplishing what they set out to accomplish. descent food in a descent setting. It's a dump serving local dirty style tex-mex for a reasonable price in a college town. What else could you ask for?",

    "text": "Let's be serious.  This is Nashville--there ain't no good Chinese food to be found in this town, particularly for this former New Yorker who practically lived off the stuff until moving to town in June.\n\nThat being said, China Spring is probably the best Chinese food I've found in Nashville so far.  The food is always hot and fresh, the portions are generous, and the prices are more than fair.  I usually order steamed chicken and vegetables with brown sauce and brown rice, which is consistently good (though not difficult to mess up).  My boyfriend likes the chicken mai fun and the wonton soup.  I love that they're close to where we live and open late into the evenings for a quick stop after an evening meeting.  Until we find something better, which probably won't be for a long while, I'll continue to head to China Spring when looking for decent Chinese food.",

    "text": "I thought it was okay, I got #1 bowl, bulgogi beef, I spent $11.99 + $2 (up size) + $1.19 x 3 (Kimchi) + 10% (TIp) + Tax = over $19 for bowl of food, which was mostly rice, a small miso soup (not good), and an okay size side of kimchi (3-4oz Dixie cups); for my palate and price point, I would rather do AYCE Koren BBQ at $19.99 for lunch. \n\nFlavor was okay, nothing special, my favorite part was the really hot sauce, and the kimchi, especially flavorful! \n\nI feel they need to do better with pricing/value, as this seems aggressive to me, after getting an upsize at $13.99. I expect to be semi wow'd going back to my Value Equation (see profile). It was just okay, and the bowl flavors didn't really work for me, it feels like a mash, that doesn't really make sense flavor wise or texture. \n\nI can't say I am a fan (4 stars), because I wouldn't return anytime soon. I would try it again, but no rush, except if I was craving kimchi, then I would return and buy a couple of those! \n\nTip - 3rd street is a one way, so I parked on Arlington and walked over, it's only meter parking too.",

I ordered the lamb shrank with vegetables and my husband roasted lamb with vegetables and potatoes. The lamb shank was very good, the roasted lamb was good. The mixed vegetables was a gray mash of peas cabbage and carrots cooked to death and they were just warm not hot. They tasted OK but look terrible. The waitress said that was how the vegetables were prepared. The food seem to be just dump together on a plate and didn't look very appetizing. We also split a Greek salad which for some strange reason didn't have any greens but the cucumbers and tomatoes and olives were tasty. I will try this place again and order something different.",

    "text": "I've been wanting to take my girlfriend out on a romantic date to a good Italian restaurant. I thought I'd give Caruso's on 4th Ave a try.\n\nThere were three hostesses when we arrived. I told one of them that I would like a booth for two. One of the girls made a strange look on her face that was either confused, annoyed or both. I couldn't tell between the two expressions. One of the hostesses takes us to a table. I told her I had asked for a booth and I thought that was where we were going because she didn't acknowledge a booth wasn't available. That's when I figured out why one of the girls made a strange look.\n\n** Just a heads up. Caruso's only takes reservations on large parties. Makes sense. But I still would have liked putting my name down to get a booth **\n\nShortly after we sat down our server came over and introduced himself. Forgot his name. But he was a decent fellow and was very knowledgeable about what was on the menu.\n\nI went in the establishment craving a cold beer. The beer menu lacked variety. It didn't entice me. Instead I ended up ordering a regular iced tea. The glass was huge, which is always great!\n\n** Keep in mind that it can be a little loud in the restaurant sometimes. **\n\nI ended up ordering The Caruso Special, which consisted of a ton of Italian spaghetti specialties. It was delicious! However, I did not feel like I got enough bang for my buck due to the rather small plate size. I wanted more for the $10.75 I put down for my meal.\n\nDon't get me wrong... Caruso's is still a good restaurant. But I will be thinking about my other options before I go back.",

Nothing stood out. \n\nAfter eating the Shrimp and Grits at Cafe Amelia, we were excited to see how others compared. At Luke, you get a sizable portion and it's good but not great. \n\nOverall, there were better samplings of brunch and creole food elsewhere.",

    "text": "I was craving a burger, and since we'd driven past this place a few times, we decided to check it out!\n\nPros: The chili cheese fries were REALLY good! The chili tasted and looked homemade (not the canned stuff) and was a huge portion. That could have been my entire meal by itself.\n\nCons: The worst thing was that the cashier was also assembling the food when she wasn't handling the money. She did NOT wash her hands OR wear gloves after touching people's cash and credit cards, itching her nose, wiping sweat off her forehead......and then just going straight back to arranging hamburger buns with their fixings with her bare dirty hands. GROSS. Nobody else seemed to notice, nor care. \n\nThe burgers were just okay. Not bad, but we were expecting better. \n\nThe wait was soooo long. We must have stood there waiting for over 25 minutes ( for two burgers, chili fries, and cheese fries). \n\nIt was about a half hour before closing and they were not allowing anyone to sit inside at the tables because they'd already been cleaned for the day. There were only two picnic tables outside to sit at. One man came in a little while before closing, and they told him they couldn't serve him. Since they were obviously still cooking and serving other people (that had arrived earlier), he was NOT happy. He stormed out and said, \"Fine buddy, but you've just lost a customer\".  I get that they were closing soon, but what's one more order before locking the doors?\n\nDespite all the cons, I loved the chili cheese fries so much that I will be going back for more! We just won't be getting any burgers. I'd like to try their milkshakes and their pesto chicken sandwich, too.",
