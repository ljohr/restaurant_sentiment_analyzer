Great place to spend the day working or studying, especially because they have cushioned seats & plenty of power outlets in the bench area.

Whatever you're thinking right now doesn't come close. You are transported to a secret garden and its beautiful, slightly overwhelming if you're not prepared, but beautiful. I immediately want to bring friends just for the experience. \n\nI was sadly disappointed by the cake. I ordered the nepolitan cake and lemon blueberry cake and a magic bar. The magic bar was delicious! I was expecting it to be sickly sweet and it wasn't. Now for the cake... the cake itself was good. Where it went wrong for me was the frosting. It was expecting a traditional buttercream and what I got was more of a lightly flavored whipped butter that coats your mouth. Again its not super sweet, which I am a fan of, but the frosting really ruined the whole experience for me. \n\nI want to go back, sit down, and have lunch.",

We saw people dressed up kind of fancy as well as people in khaki shorts and tshirts.\n\nMy wife and I recently went on a Friday night and were able to get a table rather quickly. The service was definitely slow for our tastes. There were mostly larger groups in the place, but we definitely felt that we did not receive much attention.\n\nThe bread that came out before the meal was hot and decent overall. The wine menu was about what you would expect, all the traditional wines with the cheapest (only a couple) in the low $20s for a bottle and quickly escalating to high prices from there. \n\nWe passed on appetizers and desserts and both ordered the seafood pasta. I would say we were both underwhelmed by it to be honest. I had some pretty high expectations for this plate and while I found it edible...it's not something I would order again.\n\nWe then sat around quite a while waiting for our check.\n\nOverall, I feel like we didn't get the full experience of what this place could be. We may try it again in the future, but with Gino's about the same distance from home, which much better service and larger portions for the same price, it would be tough to convince ourselves to come back.",

My husband ordered a calzone (he requested it without sauce inside). I was disappointed with the pizza. It wasn't bad, it just didn't have a lot of flavor. To be fair, they are a Chicago-style joint and it wasn't a Chicago-style pizza, so it might not have been their best. But I don't like Chicago-style pizza so I'm not sure I'll try again. The calzone was the best calzone I've tasted in a long time. I wish I hadn't ordered anything because it was huge! And it came with a side of spaghetti, although that wasn't impressive either. The service was great though. I'd be willing to come back to try other things on the menu.",

(Sponsored post, I believe)  I see a lot of reviews that rave about the cheesy grits, so I had high expectations!  Unfortunately, I was let down.  The price was $12.99. Not outrageous, but I felt there could have been more grits on the plate. The plate was very shallow, but wide.  As for the taste of the grits, I was ready to have awesome, cheesy grits, but to me, they were lacking in cheesy flavor. The shrimp were flavorful and cooked well. The bacon in the dish was excellent, so it wasn't a complete bust, but I would not order it again. My wife had an omelet which she said was very tasty.  If we go back, I would like to try the fried green tomatoes.  That is IF we go back.",

    "text": "I stopped by before a parade and met with my family who were visiting from out of town. Joanna was a great server and we loved the oysters! The place was busy and we waited about 10 minutes for our table. The hostess Jaclynne was very polite and made some great menu suggestions. However, we almost left the restaurant after witnessing one of the other staff members who I can only assume was a manager or supervisor, a black woman with very short hair, verbally accost our hostess in front of guests. It set a terrible tone for the experience and made me not want to stay and eat there. However, jaclynn continued to be kind to us despite being humiliated by the manager in front of our party as well as several guests and  we ended up staying. I felt terrible for the host and how the manager spoke to her in such an abusive and unprofessional manor. I stopped in the next night and enjoyed more oysters and fantastic service by the bartender Michelle and observed no abusive management.",

    "text": "I'm going to make the bold statement and say that I'm kind of an ice cream fanatic. Whenever I get ready for a trip, researching ice cream shops is at the top of my to-do list. I don't care if it's the dead of winter. You take coffee breaks? I take ice cream breaks. I realize that I take this obsession/addiction to an unhealthy extreme, as I've been known to eat it for dinner. \n\nWith that said, you can imagine that I was really excited to try this place since it is so highly rated on yelp. When reading the reviews, I was convinced that Creole Creamery was going to be the \"Bi-rite of the south\" (best ice cream I've ever had). I had some pretty high expectations. Unfortunately, it did not deliver quite like I thought it would but it certainly wasn't bad. \n\nMy main problem is that out of the 3 flavors I had, THEY ALL TASTED IDENTICAL. I got the Basil Coconut & Lavender and my sister got the Rose. These were some of the most unique flavors they offered and you'd think they'd be pretty distinguishable from one another. Alas, neither of us could taste much difference. The flavors were extremely subtle.\n\nWhat I did love however was the creaminess and texture. This is where it gets close to the Bi-Rite status. The ice cream itself is very rich and smooth with perfect consistency. You simply can't buy something like this in the store. Had the flavors wowed me, I would have given this 5 stars, hands down (and it truly would have become the \"Bi-Rite of the South\" in my book).\n\nAll in all, I will definitely go back. I mean, it's still great ice cream. And I'm sure if I tried a more traditional flavor, the taste would be stronger. I just really love the weird stuff :)",

However, we opted out of actually staying there, as we had read a lot of negativity about it, and it was way too pricey for our liking.\n\nThe inside really is a sight to behold. It looks like you've wandered into a well kept rainforest, complete with trees, gardens, waterfalls, bridges, and even a boat ride around the resort. Simply beautiful, and with none of the downsides of being in a jungle, like bugs and intense heat. \n\nSo...yeah, that's about it. The restaurants in the middle are also nice to look at, but way overpriced and the food isn't all that great. Another complaint is that it's extremely easy to get lost in there. I'm still not entirely sure that we got to see everything, but once we found where we entered, we weren't about to take a chance of losing it again, and left.\n\nIt's really nice to go through here once, and get lots of nice pics, but I don't think I'd return.\n\nOh, and the gas explosion that happened the day after we were there was purely a coincidence.",

This, however, was just a decent burger with no drink for $13.  Not a ton of cash for a trendy joint, I know... but again, I want the food and service to stand on its own.  Plus, we ordered to go (at lunch time, but before they got busy) and waited a good 30 minutes for our food.

    "text": "Just had a classic Wawa chicken salad hoagie. I topped it with spinach, American cheese, sweet peppers, pickles and both spicy and honey mustard. Pepper was also added. \n\nWhat I unwrapped was essentially chicken flavored mayonnaise. The toppings and mayo-mustard sauce were delectable on the soft roll, but I was really hoping that I had gotten more chicken. There are three reasons that could be contributing to my dismay. They could occur either in isolation, or some combination of the three:\n\nReason One: \nThe bottom of the chicken salad container. This area of chicken salad contains mostly mayonnaise and smaller chicken particles. \n\nReason Two: \nLunch hour. I was order #198. The sandwich being called at the counter was in the #178 range. At this time, I feel that the fine luncheoneers at this particular Wawa could have felt the pressure of the lunchtime rush. \n\nReason Three:\n\nHoagiefest. I'm sure that everyone is familiar with our favorite three month sandwich discount. More recently, the rolls moved from 12 to 10 inches. Could it possibly be that this is solely a marketing campaign and not a celebration of the world's fourth greatest sandwich?\n\nWild Card:\nLocation. There is not another Wawa in this area for, what in my estimation would, be a 3 mile radius, partially a manifestation of the lunch hour component. \n\nTwo stars for Wawa is a bit harsh, so due to past experiences with the Wawa chain, they earn three stars.",

    "text": "Stopped in for a late lunch, had been to the Mass Ave. location but had not tried this one yet.\n\nSat at the bar, bartender was eating her lunch at the bar by the cash register (poor form).  Started out with the onion rings, which I thought would be a smaller portion, but they were huge, and really really good.  I'd go back for those alone.  I had a few, boxed the rest, and ordered the Meatloaf Sandwich from the House Specialties portion of the menu.\n\nWhat came out was the most confusing quasi-sandwich I've ever encountered.  A rather large piece of meatloaf which had been griddled (and slightly burned) placed on top of a one long piece of texas toast, served with a side of brown gravy, apple slices (?) and cole slaw.  One piece of bread, not two, clearly going for the 'open faced' sandwich riff here, and lettuce, tomato and red onion were placed alongside.  I sat there for a few minutes wondering exactly what to do with this sandwich.  Do I cut it in half and slap it together, no way, too big for that.  This confusion would have been acceptable had the sandwich tasted, well, like anything.  The meatloaf was devoid of any flavor, and so was the brown gravy.  Two key components of this sandwich, completely flavorless.  The bread was ok, but at that point, rather insignificant.  I attempted to put the tomato and onions on top for a flavor infusion, but somehow, that made things taste worse.  Pretty disappointing.  The apple slices served alongside were so soggy they bent when you picked them up.  The coleslaw was ok, but not really my cup of tea.\n\nI have no doubt that Chatham Tap has some solid food on their menu, the onion rings bear that out, but avoid the meatloaf sandwich. Three stars for the onion rings, 0 for the rest.",

    "text": "Probably the best Italian in the West Chester area that has a full bar. This place has grown so much over the years, from a small BYOB to expanding and becoming packed every night (so make reservations). Because of the popularity, they use every space available and the result is a somewhat cramped and loud atmosphere.\n\nThe food isn't the best Italian in the area but certainly holds its own. It's a little on the pricy side but they put a lot of care into everything they do and make dinner an experience. You'll get started with complimentary bruschetta and bread. For appetizers, I'd recommend the grilled seafood which comes with calamari, scallops, and shrimp. They've also got a good assortment of antipastos. The meat and pasta dishes are all solid, a mix of American-Italian dishes and a few things that I've never heard of. The only dessert I've had is the key lime cheesecake which is delicious, but pricy for what you get. At the end you'll get offered some complimentary Limoncello shots as well.\n\nThey also do a lunch buffet during the week. It includes pastas, salads, and pizzas. Probably the best deal around. \n\nService has always been good, the only reason it might seem slow is if they're getting slammed, but I wouldn't say that's they're fault. \n\nOverall, if you don't have a bottle of wine or want some nice cocktails or a beer, this is the best spot to go if you're in the mood for Italian. It's better than Teca, but I'd recommend Core de Roma over for food (BYOB). Either way, you'll get a good meal here:",

I was expecting a larger group and some people were running late/canceled last minute and we were sitting outside. Our waiter, who was maybe 45, took FOREVER to even take our order. I asked him what was in the \"meat\" ravioli and he said, \"Uh... meat.\" Yeah no shit. Food took forever, service was poor, food was mediocre. I usually like Caruso's but it just kinda sucked the last time I was there.",

The pulled pork was nice and the chips were alright, but the cheese was like when you make nachos at home and microwave or otherwise melt shredded cheese over chips and then it re-coagulates... Yeah it was like that. I think it would have been much better if they had maybe heating up the chips, put the pork on them and then dropped the cheese onto the hot chips and let them melt it. That said, it was a generous portion and it was filling as a meal. \n\nI think everyone else at the table got a burger. Everyone seemed to think the burgers were pretty alright, but no one was really raving. People were happy with the beer selection and our waitress was very nice and attentive. \n\nOverall, it just wasn't honestly a memorable enough experience that with all of the other places in Nashville to eat at, I would seek the place out again without someone else suggesting it.",

As soon as we walked in, the atmosphere was noticeably cheery and welcoming. However as we sat at our booth waiting for food, the noise level became offputting. We had to practically yell across the table to have a conversation. Price wise it was too expensive considering the price to portion ratio. I got the number 6 breakfast special and was disappointed by the lack of food. I finished my plate in less than ten minutes and was  still hungry. I don't know if we will come back again, I think we can find a cheaper place to eat with greater food portions.

Beautiful produce, drool inducing cheese selections and a bakery that would break my budget if I bought everything that struck my fancy.\n\nPlus it's proximity to the freeway (for those of us who do our shopping based on distance from the 395 or 80) makes it an ideal stop to/from the airport.",

It was definitely a beautiful presentation, but there was way too much going on in regards to taste. It was sweet and salty, which tasted weird. There was some sort of bbq sauce on it that completely ruined the dish in my opinion. It was also overpowered by lettuce.

I used to go to Don Pablo's but I fell in love with On the Border's chips and salsa (their chips are nice and salty, and their salsa is a little spicier).\n\nWhen I go, 90% of the time I just sit at the bar and drink beer and snack on their chips and salsa. The beer specials are pretty good but could be a little better- weekdays has a happy hour as well as a late night happy hour too.\n\nWhen I do dine, I often just enjoy a variety of vegetarian sides. Lately, I've grown to enjoy their cheese enchiladas, which I find delicious. Service when dining is usually great.\n\nAs for the bartenders, it's really hit-or-miss. Joann is probably my favorite- she's friendly, attentive, funny, and I've really gotten to know her, and I'd give them 5 stars if my experience was with her alone. There is a bartender named Nikki though, and if she's there, I always get the worst service. She barely checks on me/us to see how we're doing, she seems unfriendly, if she actually comes to refill your chips then she will not refill your salsa, she has taken my beer and refilled it without asking (when I was done and trying to leave), and I've had to wait forever to ask her for my check. At least twice, I've had to ask other bartenders to bring my check so that I could finally close out and leave. I'd give them 1 star if my experience was based on her alone.\n\nOverall, good appetizers, cold beer, moderate prices, and usually good service.",

I usually pay $4 to $5 for it at other sushi restaurants. The mango sake drink I have was alright, but not worth the price I paid for it. \n\nOn to the main event...SUSHI! We had the philly roll, tempura roll, tuna roll, and california roll. They were all yummy, but I would have to say I have had better. Actually, out of the hand-full of sushi restaurants I have tried, this was the worst sushi I have tried, but I cannot say the sushi was bad by any means. Don't get me wrong, it was still tasty. \n\nThe other big thing was that the rolls were actually falling apart. I have never had this happen. Therefore, I can say that the presentation and the ability to get the sushi from the plate to my mouth without falling apart did make me unhappy. \n\nI am willing to come back to Nippon Tei, but I have to say I already have my other favorites. The prices were average compared to other sushi bars, so that won't really help them out either when it comes to bringing me back. We will see!",

    "text": "We stopped for lunch on Sunday. We've tried to eat here before, but the wait was too long. We had a short wait on Sunday -- hostess said 30 minutes, but it was a little over 15. Their menu is very large. We were looking it over and trying to decide on what to order when the waitress delivered an order of onion rings to the table beside us. YUM! We ordered those right away! They arrived fairly quickly and were delicious! The rings are made from \"real\" onions and have probably never seen a freezer. We probably should have just stopped there, but ordered lunch. I had the Onion Jam burger with tater tots. The burger was OK -- not great and not worth ordering again. The tater tots were nasty (how do you mess up frozen tater tots??). Others in the group had a pasta dish (again, just OK) and a turkey wrap with fries. I think she enjoyed the wrap, but the fries were mediocre. Service was good even though the place was crowded. Several tables near us had small children. Most of the kids were well behaved, but, some weren't. Folks, if you ignore your misbehaving child, don't be surprised at the nasty looks you get. Take them to McDonald's until they learn how to behave or you learn how to raise children!",

    "text": "had brunch with two friends one weekend day. one of the diners chose ant's pants. i've walked by this establishment on the way to work and didn't realize how cramped and small it is until i came for brunch. even though we arrived at like 9am (or some relatively early time), the place was packed - both in terms of seated and waiting diners. the layout of the place isn't the best; there's a long, narrow walkway to get to the seating area, in which those waiting for a seat are standing and those trying to pay a bill are waiting near the cashier. it can be hard to maneuver without accidentally bumping into someone. \n\nthe food was ok. i got an omelet with veggies and cheese with a side of fruit. it was pretty standard - nothing that blew my mind. the fruit was a little wimpy in terms of size and taste but it got the job done.  price was reasonable - i don't remember being shocked at my portion of the bill.\n\nnota bene: your party won't be seated until everyone arrives. this makes perfect sense because this restaurant is incredibly busy and needs to turn over tables quickly.",

They send a coupon for $15 and you have to use it from Sunday to Thursday of your birthday week.  This location definitely looks newer and cleaner than West Edmonton Mall.\n\nSince I usually only eat here once a year, I expected to see changes in the menu.  I noticed mostly how much the prices increased and now they offer more burger and sandwich options.  I ordered my usual choice which went up to $25, St. Louis ribs and 1/4 chicken with baked beans and and baked potato but the coleslaw is also good.  It was good, guess you can't really go wrong.  The sides were just enough, not too generous.\n\nThe waitress was friendly and efficient and wished me a happy birthday but they don't offer any dessert or anything for the birthday.  The restaurant was almost full by the time we left around 6:15 p.m. on a Tuesday so looks like this location is doing well.",

So let's just say I couldn't be happier to get my mimosa which was pretty tasty. That waiter Jonathan was great very attentive and friendly. I ordered a Monte cristo, French toast honey roasted ham, mascarpone and pineapple I couldn't wait to dig in. My boyfriend ordered salmon Beni and it looked fabulous. Just as I took a bite of my sandwich which was great  my boyfriends facial expression changed as he pulled a long piece of blond hair from his food. Needless to say we were done, however they did comp our meal and gave us a few free doughssants.  They were very apologetic about the incident.

    "text": "This review is for the bar area only.  \n\nThis one is a tough review.  On one hand the service we got was rough.  They seemed to be a man down for a while and it really showed, but on the otherhand, when our waiter arrived he was really cool, helpful and took GREAT care of us.\n\nThen the food had two hands too.  On one the food was decent, and nothing to really complain about, standard bar fare with a really tasty item called the chingalinga I think.  But on the otherhand it was 'merkinized mexican bar food.  One thing we for sure will get next time will be the grilled chicken nachos instead of the shredded chicken.  Just too bland.\n\nThe drinks also had some duality.  We had two of the special drinks and those were really good.  But my standard bloody mary was so lame that the waiter took it on himself to make me one with much more flavor.  I know, I know bloody mary requests at a Cantina?  \n\nThe atmosphere in the bar is actually nice and open when we went.  It seems lots of the Victorian bars have this same vibe.  \n\nAnd thankfully the prices during happy hour were really good.  So good I think the next time I am looking for a friendly place to have a few drinks with people in Sparks, I will scoot on down for their happy hour for sure.\n\nParking may be a little tight during busy times, but when we went, parking was right out front and plentiful across the street.",

    "text": "I have had a few pretty good experiences here and one really negative one that prompted our party to leave before eating. \n\nGenerally speaking, the food is good. It's the best Italian in town, in my opinion, but my mother would fight me on that one. They start you off with some complimentary bruschetta, which is nice. I recommend the Mixed Baby Greens salad to start, which is more like a Greek salad and is a generous portion for $5. I would also recommend the Porcini Stuffed Agnolotti. I have tried a few of their desserts - I liked the Chocolate Souffle but thought the Coppa Pistachio left something to be desired. The free limoncello shot at the end of the meal is a nice touch.\n\nThe problem here is the service. It seems that there is always a wait, even if you have a reservation. I don't usually mind waiting but they have very little standing room and no vestibule, so you end up standing by the door and get blasted with cold air every time someone opens it. I went recently with my family for their lunch buffet, which looked quite nice. We ended up waiting about 25 minutes, during which the hostess sat several smaller parties (which is fine), then started to seat a slightly larger party that had come in long after us. When we interjected to find out what was going on and why we had been passed over, the hostess said something along the lines of \"Oh I don't know, you all walked in at once.\" We had been there much longer, but apparently she hadn't been keeping a list (she told us so) even though she had been taking names. Isn't that what hostesses DO? Only upon us asking why this was happening and expressing our unhappiness with the service did she run off to check with a manger then report back that she needed to seat the larger party, without explanation. By this time the buffet was close to its end time and it seemed silly to pay only to receive the last bits and pieces, so we decided to leave and go down the street to Kooma where we were seated immediately and had a delicious brunch!\n\nThis restaurant is fine and a good choice if you are craving Italian food, but I generally prefer other places in West Chester. Also, be prepared for a wait and a potentially rude hostess!\n\nBut by the way, Richard works here now - he used to work at Gilmore's and is the best waiter in town!",

    "text": "This review pertains only to Saigon market, I will save the Restaurant for another review.\n\nThis is probably my least favorite Asian Market in town and probably Asian for that matter.  But they have two benefits that earn a visit from me every now and then.  \n\nEven though they have a very limited fresh meat selection but it is definitely the best out of all the Asian market.  You won't find rib eyes or filet mignon here, but more rustic cut such as pork belly, pork shoulder, beef shank, beef loin, and innards.  The second benefit is the one male worker, i think he's the butcher, stocking boy, and cleaner.  He's pretty fast when it comes to helping you with the meat.  If i needed him to cut the meat and bones a certain way, he'll be on it.  His English isn't very good but I think he can make out keyword and can help you find what you are looking for. \n\nTheir vegetable selection is limited and caters to Asian cooking.  Out of all the Asian market on Lafayette Road, Saigon has the worst vegetables!   They always look like they are dead or near dead.   The herbs in the refrigerated section is not too bad though and usually pretty fresh.  If you are wanting to buy vegetables though, I say skip Saigon and go to Saraga or Oriental market. \n\nSaigon has a similar selection of dried goods and frozen items like Van's Fish Market.   Check expiration dates especially on canned goods and I would be careful of frozen items as well.  I always make sure I do a thorough examination.  \n\nSaigon also sells freshly made bake goods and exotic fruits, and you can find them scatter up by the register.  The owner usually stands behind the register, she usually doesn't say anything to any of the shopper unless she knows them.  I wish she would be more cheery because it kinda ruins my shopping mood because I enjoy grocery shopping.  Overall, Saigon would be a MEH experience but the fresh meat selection earns this place another star.",

    "text": "Here is our back story.  Do you have a little time to kill?  Good because it's gonna be fascinating.  I'm gonna wow you with amazing tales of chili dogs and burgers.  No wait...don't go!  It'll be great!\n\nOk well for those of you who stayed...here's my back story.  We were in the GSR for a Pentatonix concert.  We had gotten there early to camp out a spot to get a better seat because the general admission at the GSR is really bad.  So this meant that during our dinner hour we were going to be stuck in line.  Luckily a very nice couple held our spot while we stopped into Johnny Rockets.\n\nWe asked to sit at the bar to make it quicker.  We ordered up two chili dogs for my daughter, a classic burger for my wife and I ordered up the Houston. I upgraded to sweet potato fries for a buck extra.  The burgers coming out looked really good, mine wasn't as good looking and was just fine tasting.  Nothing to write home about or get excited about, just a standard fare sort of burger.\n\nMy daughter however loved the chili dogs and ate them all up and her fries.  She enjoyed the paper hat that came with the kids meal menu.   Our waitress Daniel was really busy but also really helpful and friendly.\n\nSo if you are staying at the hotel for either a convention or just gambling, this place is a good place to eat for a reasonable price.  The prices are right in line with any other sit down burger joint, maybe even a little lower.\n\nParking isn't really that close because it's inside the mall downstairs at the GSR, but it is 1000000 times better than it's old location on the casino floor getting covered in smoke all day long.  \n\nWondering how busy they will be when summer comes and \"The Beach\" is open.  We will see.",

The seafood bastilla and mint tea were easily the best part for the meal. The decor is cozy, if a bit cheesy. It feels like walking into a hideaway of some 50's movie about the desert, more than a slice of Moroccan culture. Unfortunately, I've yet to go on a night with belly dancers.",

    "text": "First I must say the food was excellent.  The gorganzola filet with wine sauce was truly outstanding.  My primary complaint was with the service.  I was staying the week at the hotel next door and had dinner at Carmine's 3 times.  I finally came to the conclusion that management has trained the waiters to rush the service in order to turn the tables as frequently as possible.   Each night I dined with work  associates and throughout the meals the waiters kept trying to take away plates too soon.  It became difficult to have a relaxing dinner and constantly felt rushed.   On the 3rd night we spoke to the owner and it was clear that he did not want to take our complaint seriously and issued a very insincere apology.   In the end, he paid for our meals .  All of us at the table would have preferred that he would have acted more humble and treat us with more respect.  We were not looking for a free meal.  It was a company expense anyway.  We can only hope that he might think about what we told him.   We were most sincere and not trying to be difficult.  In his mind we were wrong and he was right.    All of the waiters I saw looked and acted somewhat inexperienced.  I suspect that mature professional waiters would not get along with the owner very well.   He seemed like a hot head and is probably difficult to work for.",

    "text": "I really want to give Taj India a break because I really appreciate them for being there. Northeast Philly is desperate for decent Indian food, and Taj is definitely decent Indian food. Decent. Sometimes great, sometimes kind of lacking, but almost always decent. However as far as Indian food goes I've had much better for the same or similar price within 20-30 minute driving distance. \n\nI never eat in the place, it's a little depressing looking and often with weird music playing...but it's clean...I just prefer home in this case.\n\nOh, they also have a wide array of Indian desserts but I think they  might be too authentic for most Americans' taste...not sure...I'm not into trying random sweets but that's what I've heard.\n\nStuff I love about Taj: they make dosas! but also do a good job at north Indian dishes like Channa Masala, fairly cheap, call in your order and pick it up! The food reheats fairly well in a warm oven or a quick dump into a pot on the stove. Viola! Like new! Oh and its all vegetarian! \n\nStuff I don't love: I have to ask 5 times to get enough mint chutney, the sambhar is a little salty at times, some of the curries aren't that good (don't do the black dahl! go for channa masala. Also the naans are really good as are a lot of the appetizers, including the samosas. \n\nAll in all, it's a great find for the area, but it's sometimes hit or miss on some of the dishes. However the naan, samosas, and channa masala have been consistantly good.",

I know a dozen people who go there weekly as their neighborhood bar and even they are exasperated by how consistently awful the service is. Good luck getting acknowledged, greeted, served, offered water, given a menu, getting checked up on. It's never excessively busy - they just don't seem to know how a bartender/server is supposed to treat customers.

I wouldn't call it bad, but it's a whole lot of fried food and most of the breadings, whether it's fried pickles or okra or calamari or shrimp, are the same across all of that. The batter is fine, but it gets wearing. The coconut shrimp and hush puppies were definitely overcooked, which was kind of disappointing. Coke Zero on tap, but the mix could be better. For the price, it is also worth nothing there is a ton of food here, definitely quantity over quality. D\u00e9cor is pretty cool and this is parked right along the Boise river, though it's a bit tucked away and has to be more or less sought out...probably worth hitting at least once, but there are far better local places that are more worthy of attention.",

    "text": "Study in contrasts. Went to Kazoku on Wednesday and Sachiko on Friday. Ordered same dinner for fair comparison: chicken teriyaki, nigiri, sashimi for $18.95. Chicken was definitely not stored at right temperature; tasted strong off note immediately. Nigiri: sake, maguro, ebi, and hamachi not as fresh, firm as Kazoku's. Sashimi: two pieces of sake, three of maguro; all smelled fishier than one would expect, and taste aligned with smell. Not good. Dinner came with miso soup, iceberg & shredded carrot salad, and potato salad. Overall, meh at best. Not as bad as I've had in places such as Bowling Green, KY (really should have known vetter), but not worth going out of your way for. Of course, I ordered a cheap combination that doesn't show an expectation for the restaurant's best nigiri or rolls; one might expect low-quality off-cuts for such a combo. If that's the case, then that's why I'm giving three stars rather than one. Caveat emptor, to be sure.",

    "text": "First I want to thank the Yelp community!  Your reviews led me to this spot. Me & my bff drove from Memphis to Nashville to create our own Diners, Drive-in, Dives best Burger experience. So in pursuit of the best burger in Nashville I checked in with my Yelpers. Thanks for your reviews. \n\nThe vibe in the area is amazing!  I will definitely be going back & trying other places.\n\nYada yada I know get to the review right. The service sucked. There was only two tables with people when we got there so why we had to special request water I have no idea. Now, I have my suspicions, but considering we were dressed business casual and the diction in my request should have have debunked any of the false assumptions & stereotypes that may have promoted the lack of service. I must admit it made me appreciate Memphis.  When I get crappy service I know it's just standard, but it feels like its crappy because I  came into the wrong restaurant in the wrong neighborhood  makes me feel some type of way \n\nI digress. The service sucked. We picked the restaurant for the pics & the reviews.  I ordered the 96. The 96 is a blue cheese burger with French fries on top. Sheer nostalgia drew me to this place. It took me make to school lunch when I used to put my fries on my hamburger.  Who could resist a place that intentionally puts the fries on the burger? Now the burger surpassed the Franklin Middle School supreme but it wasn't so spectacular that I would make the 3 hr drive again. We also had the tot fondue...tater tots & cheese sauce, like really really thick cheese sauce. It tasted like they made the roux and went straight to the cheese no milk. My recollection of a fondue sauce is much thinner. But hey, it could have been an off night. We had the pickles in peppers which had either a beer batter or tempura either way it was way too greasy to be enjoyable.  \n\nI had a great time with friends but the food was marginal & the service doesn't really deserve honorable mention. I give it 3 stars for the neighborhood & maybe it was an off night.\n\nThey did let me sign the wall  ....look for PenelopeChristmas",

The thickness of the patty was similar to a juicy, thick burger.  Although it was not what anyone would categorize as juicy, but it definitely possessed the grilled flavor of a burger.  The bread, however, was nothing special and really not worth eating.  I would recommend sticking to the \"Syberg's\" labeled items and having a dish that includes the famous Syberg's sauce.",

    "text": "It was a pretty cute little restaurant; the atmosphere was definitely \"neighborhood pub.\"  We had a very nice (very obviously not Ethiopian) waitress with multiple visible piercings.  She was (*gasp* ) very attentive for an Ethiopian restaurant waitress.  The service was not as good quick as the average non-Ethiopian restaurant, but it definitely blew all the Ethiopian restaurant services away with the speed!  Gee, I wonder if it could be because she's not Ethiopian?!?!?!  hahaha  However, she did mention that she grew up in West Philly eating Ethiopian food.  mmmm I'm jealous!  \n\nAs is my custom, I went to use the bathroom and wash my hands before the meal.  Considering that Ethiopian food is eaten with one's hands, I would highly recommend this practice to all my friends .  There were two \"stalls\" in the bathroom.  Both stalls have saloon styled doors (2 halves swinging freely in the middled, hinged on either side).  The first one was lit, but the right half of the door was missing.  Given this, I opted for the second stall.  After stepping inside, I noticed a good 2 inches between the halves of the door.  Needless to say, I did my business in a hurry all the while praying that no one else would come in.  PLEASE LADIES, GO TO THE BATHROOM BEFORE EATING AT THIS RESTAURANT.  It is a harrowing experience!\n\nWhen the food came (sooner than expected), the portions were fairly generous.  When I bit into the injera at the Queen of Sheba, I was pleasantly surprised.  It was fairly sour!  It was not as sour as Abyssinia's injera, but definitely a few steps more sour than anywhere else I have tried up to date.  Now, I'm not saying ideal injera should be sour, but I like mine that way.   hahaha  Unfortunately parts of the injera were a little dried.  *sigh*   It's a toss up for me between dried injera versus more sour injera.   \n\nThe dishes were all decent, but not amazing.  My companion liked the potatoes in the carrot, string bean, potato dish.  I thought their salad was fabulous - fresh and dressed perfectly.  I did not care for the raw onions, but have to admit the taste was a nice contrast to the other dishes.  Both lentil dishes were decent, as I have said before it is difficult for me to tell much of a difference in them.  However, my trusty sidekick noted that the lentils were more watery at Kaffa Crossing.  I know that 1 of the lentil dishes was too spicy for me, but I am a big, Big wuss when it comes to spices, so that is neither here nor there.   The lamb was a big disappointment, it was a little sour (bad?).  The collard greens were pretty standard, nothing amazing.",

    "text": "Blush Lane Market is a really great place for organic products. I like how everything is well organized and the products always look appealing. The staff are friendly and actually seem to enjoy their jobs. I haven't approached a sales person for assistance but I'm often greeted and asked if I need help. \n\nComparatively to Planet Organic, they have similar stock and similar prices although on occasion I have found some things to be marginally cheaper at Blush Lane and they seem to have more frequent sales on more items. However I still shop more often at Planet Organic simply because parking is a bit of an inconvenience here. There is meter parking on the street, or underground pay parking in the Roots building - but personally when I'm shopping for groceries I prefer the convenience of being in an out as quickly as possible. \n\nAnd I'm not sure if I just come at the wrong times, but I've never seen more than one cashier on the till at Blush. The last particular time I was there on a Sunday to purchase two items, spinach and apples. I ended up leaving without buying anything because there was line of several people with full carts and one cashier. An express lane or self-checkout would be really helpful. I still love Blush Lane for it's great products, just sometimes it's not the most convenient.",

The waiter recommended the $25 level (the second lowest level), disregarded all attempts to order the more expensive tasting menu, and basically insisted that the $25 level would be fine for us.

    "text": "Went to the newest addition to Japanese food on the north side, early on a Wednesday evening. \n\nIt's nice to have another option in the area, that isn't Sakura or H20, and who doesn't love a restaurant where their \"mascot\" is an octopus dressed as a hibachi chef?\n\nThe decor reminded me of something out of a Sims game - black, red and futuristic, a refreshing style for a city that is often full of stale interior design for restaurants. Lots of fancy LED lighting and a bit of tacky fish oriented decorations too, but, it's nice and comfortable and contemporary.  Even the music playing over the loud speaker was downtempo, providing a \"big city\" feel to the establishment.\n\nWe were greeted instantly, and seated in the dining area, being that we were here for sushi and not hibachi. All the hibachi tables were being used though, either by groups or couples.  They also have a larger hibachi in a private area for large groups.\n\nMy friend had some spicy rolls and really enjoyed them. The presentation was clean and crisp. I had some sashimi and the fish was fresh, generous and delicious. I went to Sakura two days later alone, and the nigiri tasted fishy, when the salmon I had at Tomo was fresh and sweet, as salmon should be. \n\nI also had the shrimp tempura appetizer which featured two very large prawns (biggest I've had in the city!) and a nice mix of veggies. They were tasty as well. \n\nThe service was a bit slow, but, needs were met when requests were made. They also have a somewhat vast (for Japanese) wine list and they make fancy cocktails such as mai tai's. I look forward to trying their hibachi and furthering my menu experience, glad to have Tomo here!",

I look forward to when that is available (I went two weeks ago so maybe it already is)     Location..   what's not to like?  On the pier!  A wonderful outdoor patio,  couldn't have a nicer setting to enjoy your tasting....   The staff were super, super nice,  I would give them an A+!  \n\nSo why only three stars?  It is because of the wine club!  Very expensive for the quality of the wines and stingy as HELL with the benefits to the members..   Most wine clubs will give you a free tasting every time you come in (after all, we are your best customers... we are the ones who buy your wine time and time again).  Some wineries will give their members a complimentary glass in leau of a tasting (Carr).   Most wineries allow you to bring guests which is how you get new wine club members.   This system works folks!  The way this wine club works is that you are given a very limited number of passes per quarter, five as I recall.   If I come with my wife once a month we wouldn't even be covered... let alone if we bring a guest!   \n\nSo go to this winery if you want to enjoy a tasting in one of the most beautiful settings on earth.   But avoid the wine club!  For that you can pretty much go to any of the other wine tasting rooms on the Urban wine trail.",

    "text": "For our last dinner in NOLA we randomly picked a 4 star place that had crawfish \u00e9touff\u00e9e. That was the only criteria. \n\nAmbiance was ok. It's Bourbon Street so the clientele is generally drunk. It was ok. Noise level average to above average. \n\nService was slow but reasonably nice. \n\nBBQ shrimp - good as advertised but the best part is dipping the free bread in the sauce. \n\nBoiled shrimp - plain. Nothing of note. \n\nRaw oysters - no brine left, far too big. Tasteless. \n\nRoasted oysters - with parm, these were decent. I'd get them again. \n\nHush puppies - good. \n\nFried green tomatoes - disappointing. I've had enough of the NOLA style of cooking which seems to be \"fry the damn thing up.\" I was told by 2 southerners with us that they are not supposed to be battered & fried. \n\nSweet potato fries - good. Worth it. \n\nCrawfish \u00e9touff\u00e9e - decent. Not the best thing in the world but I'd recommend the dish. This is what I came here for and it was decent/ok. \n\nJambalaya - tasted like it was made with hot dogs. After going to Coop's it is almost inedible. \n\nShrimp creole - absolute rubbish. Never get this unless you are in a dungeon and have nothing else to eat. \n\nGeneric po boy - fairly mundane. I'm tired if these sandwiches but even at that this was not good. \n\nOverall you could do worse, but you certainly could do better. Not worth the trip but if you end up there by chance there is good, and bad, food on the menu. Make sure you know what to get and avoid the rubbish.",

He wanted us to make our dinner order before we even got our wine order figured out. He really did not know how to serve wine. We ordered a bottle and after he poured the three glasses he took the bottle off the table which is completely inappropriate . We ended up only ordering guacamole and chips and ate dinner elsewhere. It's too bad that this menu was so fussy and overpriced because the decor was really cute and really nice. I loved the dim lighting and the upstairs seating but I just did not want to stay there. We went to Puckett's boathouse instead which was much more low key and had way better wine",

I'd say it's pretty packed for a weekday. There was a 30 minutes wait for outside seating so we decided to take inside instead. \n\nWas craving for some oysters so i tried their oyster shooters. Hmm definitely too sour for me. It was really just okay. I got their crab cake. Came with onion rings and salad. My sister got their fried calamari, shrimp, scallops, and oysters. Also came with onion rings and salad. Love their fried calamari and oysters! \n\nTheir foods are okay. Service is very attentive and friendly :) But I think this place is overrated.

I've lived down the block for a few weeks now, but visited Crazy Sushi even when I was living up in UC.\n\nTo start off, the food is good. The rolls are priced fairly, and the veggie gyoza compares to the best of the same that I've had in Cali (full disclosure: I think Cali has the best Japanese food in the country). The plates are beautifully decorated, and I think the decor inside the place, bar the color changing effects, are absolutely beautiful (I'm a fan of contemporary design). In particular, the sweet potato roll and the cucumber+avocado roll are my favorites, although I'm looking forward to trying the mango one soon too.\n\nIn any case, I really want to like the place, but the constant finding of hairs (not ours) in the food during our two visits and the subsequent 'not-caring' of the wait staff has been somewhat disappointing. Further, the lack of attention to detail - not bringing over new soy sauce containers when the other one is empty, not refilling water, etc. is disappointing as well, and in all, costs Crazy Sushi 2 stars.\n\nWith that being said, the food is still good, but if they just wore hair nets or whatnot and kept things more hygienic, and improved service a tad bit, that would definitely go a long way!",

    "text": "Eaten here a few times and came strictly for drinks yesterday. Bailey's and all their restaurants are great and so is the Range. 3.5 stars would be a truthful number. Mainly, I round down because of their service. My reasoning for the almighty stars would be as follows: \n\n4 - amazing food. quality ingredients with chefs who know how to experiment with flavors that go together better than you and your girlfriend (boyfriend). I have not heard anyone saying they do not like their burgers. They are small (errrr. Gourmet) in portion but big in flavor. Sauces are hit and miss, french fries are good to great, and everything I've eaten or tried off another plate was a big hit, except for the patty melt which is a bust. My stove does better than theirs for this regard. \n\n3.5 - price point again is the Achilles heel for all Bailey's places to me. I am from Chicago. When I want to pay Chicago prices I usually end up going to all the best places in Chicago. St. Louis has been rated one of the most cost effective cities to live in recently - NOT because of the Range, Chocolate Bar, Rooster, etc. \n\n3 - The service is average, at best. The staff is friendly? (not rude), slow, and I find it hard to remember a time when they have gone out of their way. It is as if they are not working for tips. \n\nSure, the Bailey's restaurants are sleek, sexy, cool, and important to the city evolving...I love that. But please hire some people who are also sleek, sexy, cool, and important to the city evolving.",

Forever grateful for that as there are only two big tables for two parties out back. We lucked out that night. Was happy they brought everyone's sushi out at same time. Waitress was very friendly and attentive though our group requested water few times from other staff and we only received it as we were paying bill. There was a big salmon bone in one of my rolls, which was scary, but overall I was very happy with my order. I tried my friends chirachi bowl and found some of the fish to taste less than fresh so I completely understood why he didn't finish it. Two rolls and a small beer was $40 before tip. Not a great feeling there, but when they are the only sushi game in town, what can you do?",

YES. \n\nxochitl, the RESTAURANT you go to for an impressively cooked meal that is worth the somewhat overpriced expense for mexican food ... NOT SO MUCH.  \n\nthey do serve some of the finest margaritas in the city. they are, as rumored, strong and should be consumed with caution. and the guac, though very high at $9, is incredible. each table has a guac card that you can use to customize the ingredients you'd like to add to your guac, including jalapenos, garlic, tomatoes, peppers, oaxaca, and so many other things. i only say that it's steep at $9 because you don't get much in quantity, but it's fair considering the cost of avocados. \n\nthe food was quite the disappointment.  years ago (before the menu revamp), the food was incredible. i still remember one of the duck entrees i had there as being the best duck i have ever eaten. HOWEVER, the same cannot be said now.  \n\nwe had 2 people in our group order the $26 braised short rib. and they did not even finish it. the meat was dry and a bit bland -  totally tragic. \n\nthe rest of our table had tacos - the carne asada, the carnitas and the fish. these were solid. honestly, there wasn't anything to complain about, but they weren't particularly memorable either. \n\nthe tacos ranged from $13-16 and included 3 tacos. of the ones we tried, i'd say the fish tacos were my favorite. \n\nthis is the upside though. considering the dearth of options fish taco lovers have in this city, if you're having a serious fish taco craving, xochitl is a reliable bet. the fish is not breaded/fried and it tastes very fresh, citrusy and the slaw gives it great crunch.",

Other then that, the thin crust style pizza was well executed and all of the ingredients were fresh. The prosciutto wasn't overly salty and the sauce was lovely.\n\nI will probably go back soon to try a bit more from the menu since there were a lot of things that were appealing like the Melanzana and Salsiccia pizzas or the Nutella Pizza for dessert, yum.  \n\nTo be continued...",

When I was a kid it was called Ron's School House, but they've changed the name. My family and I came tonight to celebrate my brother's birthday. We had a nice time, were seated quickly, service was friendly and attentive and we learned quickly that some of us should have stuck with what they are known for and not ventured into the extravagant choices of the menu. My brother got a Philly chicken cheese steak and a side of fire grilled vegetables, both of which he's had before and no complaints there. My Dad ordered an American meal- Chicken breast with a side of mashed potatoes and broccoli and also a caesar side salad. He liked his meal. My mom and I both ordered the eggplant parmasean dish with a side of spaghetti.. the noodles were slightly overcooked and the marinara sauce was very bland. I tried doctoring it up by adding grated table cheese, it helped a little.. but no basil or any other spices or flavoring.. disappointed in that. The actual eggplant.. where was it? It was heavily breaded and the eggplant was so thin I practically had to get a magnifying glass out to see it. Also it was fried, and covered it cheese- the cheese was probably the best part. It was so heavy from being fried and breaded. One thing I did enjoy though was I got the butternut, nutmeg, pumpkin soup for an extra $2. The soup was hearty, filling and sweet.\n\nIf you've never visited Ron's, i'd recommend sticking to the Ovals- pizza, which is what they're known for. I enjoyed the soup too, so check that out. Prices range from $8-17 for lunch and dinners. They also have a bar which stays pretty packed. We went tonight for dinner around 6 and the bar was already full by then and the dining rooms were filling up fast.",

    "text": "Natural Cafe is one of the best restaurants for vegetarians.  Their Buddha burritos and Falafel pitas are among my favorites. Their new location at Camino Real marketplace is great too,  although the older one at Old Town was more classic.  \n\nThe reason I gave 3 stars instead of a 4.5 or 5 was because of a few ridiculous rules they have.  First,  they regularly email discount coupons but want them to be printed in order to avail the discounts.  I find this very silly.  The name of the restaurant is Natural Cafe and they have messages all over the place to protect the environment.  But it's strange that they need a paper printout and don't allow if we show them the email in the phone. \n\nSecond,  they are also very strict with timings.  If you come around the closing time (9 PM), they just keep showing at the table to get you out.  The older place at Old Town was more relaxed with the timings. \n\nI would have given a higher rating of not for these absurd rules.  The food here is still one of the best.",

    "text": "Ok,  my initial disappointment has been  somewhat eliviated, but the Opryland Resort is still lacking a world-class resort feel.  Perhaps it's the purpose and theme of the hotel.  There are some really nice amenities,  especially the shopping. \n\nThe restaurants are somewhat disappointing.  Although many choices,  it kind of feels like different versions of the same choices.  Pricing is a premium,  but food is not. \n\nFinally,  I still don't think the resort understands what is necessary to be world-class.  It's not the property,  rooms,  or even the pricing.  It's the lack of that special sense of being taken care of.   \n\nAs a Marriott/SPG property, benchmark the Phoenician, Camelback  Inn or Desert Ridge in Scottsdale to see how it should be done.",

It was Labor Day, and I was surprised they were even open. We did have to wait 40 minutes for a table, and this was at 11:30. We found parking on the street, which was surprisingly easier to find than expected. \n\nHoney's had indoor and outdoor seating, we chose the inside seating because it was HOT and no shade. We got the biggest table in the joint and were seated with menus and beverages. It has a homey style to it.\n\nThere is a plethora of brunch options. I heard the pancakes are huge, and some items such as the breakfast bomb just seemed like too much food. I chose the open faced biscuit sandwich with veggie sausage and gravy. I also got the home fries, but could have had grits, hash browns or latke. \n\nMy friends got omelettes (designed) and the bomb. I couldn't finish my food as it was too much, and I got the smaller menu item. \n\nService was great-we never ran out of coffee, tea or fresh squeezed OJ. I would say try it once before making it a go-to destination.",

Even though he had to walk all the way around the bar to help us, he did it as often as he need to make sure we were take care of. The bar burger was huge!....Unbelievably! You'd think for a bar burger it would be much smaller but I'm sure it was their regular size dinner burger. Chargrilled meat cooked perfectly, squeeze in between tomatoes lettuce and chargrilled bun... yum!

Place about 1/3 full and of course the table we'd requested was filled. That was disappointing, but not as disappointing as dinner. Calamari was pretty rubbery, entrees just so-so.

The decor is very \"shabby chic\" and fits with its more \"hipster\" 20-something clientele. \n\nFirst of all, we went on a monday morning to dodge the crowd.  We heard from friends that the wait could get seriously prohibitive.\n\nI had a fresh-squeezed orange juice which was incredible.  Any fresh squeezed juice that I've had has been amazing, but the price was equally palatable.  The coffee is still on my \"to-try\" list, however I hear its very good.\n\nI had the Challah French Toast (~$7.25) which came as advertised. It was very basic for the price.  Real maple syrup made this dish one of the best french toast I've had in quite some time.  To add to that, the blueberry preserves on the table complemented the meal quite well.  However, I would have appreciated a potato latke or some other side as the meal was... basic.\n\nMy wife got an omelet of modest size but smaller than I'd like, which tasted very good.  Their redskin potato home-fry was rather poorly made.  It tasted too much like olive-oil and was seasoned with WAY too much rosemary.  A decent spread but I couldn't help but feel like I was paying a bit for the experience as the food left a little lacking.\n\nBottom Line:  A great spot for a nice breakfast, but not quite worth the price for the taste and portion.\n\nI hear their bargain breakfast is ($3.95) quite the deal, and worth the price.  I'll have to try that next time and hopefully give a better rating.",

    "text": "This place is pretty excellent- definitely a go-to for me and the BF.  Some notes:\n\n-HAPPY HOUR and LATE NIGHT:  Happy Hour is 5-7 weekdays, and gets you half-price margaritas ($2.50 is hard to beat).  Late night is Sunday-Thursday 10pm-12am, and gives you half-price margaritas AND draft beers (usually they have a few decent craft beers).\n\n*update- all specials have gone up :( bummer.  Alas! \n\n\n-$1 per person endless chips, smoked pico de gallo and salsa verde- DELICIOUS, and perfect happy hour/late night food\n\n-Be wary: the margaritas can pack a punch.  It may be the cheap tequila, but inevitably these hit me after the fact in a weird and often headache and/or hangover-inducing manner that margaritas (even strong ones) don't usually give me.  Drink lots of water, that's for sure- and don't let this deter you.  \n\n-Vegetarian Texas Cheesesteak?  AMAZING.\n\n-Brunch includes a free drink for each adult over $21 (Bloody Mary or Mimosa).  VEGETARIANS BE WARNED- the Bloody Mary mix is NOT vegetarian, and not all of the waiters know that.  I asked, was told it was vegetarian, had my BF try it, asked again to have them double-check, and found out it wasn't.  I lucked out, but if you are allergic to seafood or vegetarian, stick with the Mimosa and make sure the waiters double-check anything that could mess with your dietary restrictions.",

They do eat-in or take out, and I hear they do delivery but I'm not certain. \n\nI ordered the chef sauce noodle, and while it was decent it just didn't seem ~$9 good which is what you end up paying after tax. The dish was mostly noodles, lacking much of anything else. The sauce, meat, and green onions were practically condiment portions, but still managed to leave a large pool of oil/grease at the bottom of the container they were placed in. I put more sriracha on stir fry that already has sauce on it. The noodles were decent but nothing to write home about, and for all I know could've been bought from a store. \n\nThe people running the counter were nice but for lunch time with no one in the restaurant when I arrived, service was pretty slow (I got mine to go). \n\nOverall, Kung Fu Noodle isn't bad, its just okay. With China Pasta House being only 10 minutes away with higher quality, quantity, homemade, and cheaper noodles + potstickers, I have hard time thinking I'd choose this place first. \n\nWorth a try, I'd take it over Americanized Chinese food any day, but the prices are a bit steep for what you get.",

    "text": "So I got the MEMO about the 50 cents oyster @ Happy Hour...and during our visit to NOLA...we were so eager to go to eat as many oysters possible at a steal deal price!\n\nArrived around 4ish on a HOT (week)day. We both were tourists..wearing shorts, t-shirts and sandals just like MOST others in the bar (happy) hour area. The hostess was friendly but the waiter was just a plain @$$ ...pardon my language here.\n\nYup, we got the head to toe look and he walked around and talked to us with his nose pointing to the ceiling, oh, come on!! We didn't care really... all we wanted were just some fresh oysters and great beer to wash away the heat.\n\nWe ordered a dozen of the oysters and the duck liver and rabbit pate $8 with two glasses of beer (we later got a second round of beer).\n\nThe oysters came out slowly.. we almost finished our beer when they arrived. They looked grossed and not cleaned well. I understand it was 50 cents each..but they shouldn't cut corners on cleanliness especially while serving raw food plus they are a fancy restaurant..how do you expect us to come back for the pricier dinner if you can't even clean the oysters well?\n\nWe were thinking to order a couple more dozens but the fact that we tasted the debris from the oyster shucking process in each oyster PLUS the unappetizing look of the small shells sticking on the oyster' shells.. we just got turned off!\n\nThe pate was excellent and we loved the pickled cucumber etc and the warm toasted bruchetta that came with it and $8 was certainly worth the priced. We licked it clean!!\n\nWe were planning to go to Luke for a couple times during our NOLA visit and even considered going there for dinner (we watch food network and top chef masters) BUT our not-so-great first (and only) happy hour experience @ Luke left none to desire to come back.\n\nOur total tab including tax and tip was about $40... they get you on the alcohol..\n\nThe pate is a 4 to 5 stars..the oyster price is also a 5 stars, BUT the snotty service and lack of cleanliness didn't make the cut..so I'm giving Luke a fair 3 stars.",

    "text": "I came here with a large group of people. I don't feel as if this is a good place for large groups...the seating just really doesn't accommodate so half our party left. Those of us that remained (6 of us) ordered food and drinks. I really enjoyed the guac and the drinks. The tacos were just ok. The steak was probably the best, followed by the pastor....I didn't even finish the shrimp and bacon one even though the waitress recommend it. Difference in taste buds I guess because I didn't like it at all. This place Is also EXTREMELY loud but I guess that just goes with the territory around here. I did like that the waitress broke up our bill into individual checks without even asking!",
