    "text": "I actually think the beignet here were better than Cafe Du Monde.  They were lighter and fluffier.  However, they were also WAAAAY bigger.  I'm fairly certain that one person should never eat three beignet at a sitting anyway, but the idea of eating three of these gives me sugar shock.  We split an order, and I still couldn't finish.\n\nThat's not really a complaint, though.  Just be aware that, if you're going for beignet, you should bring an appetite - and two friends.  Anyway, we stumbled across this little gem while we were wandering around the French Quarter, trying to figure out what we wanted to eat.  The atmosphere is wonderful - the Cafe sits at the back of an open courtyard, with tables (some under a patio), and on Friday night, there were musicians playing jazz.  The music carried well, without being so loud we couldn't carry on a conversation.  I believe if you went up the stairs, there was a bar up there (although, probably another establishment).  I'm tempted to give this place five stars for the atmosphere alone, but a restaurant is more than atmosphere.  It was a wonderful way to spend a Friday evening.\n\nOther than the beignet, the food was fine.  It was nothing spectacular, but I got a pretty good club, and my fiance got a pretty good roast beef po'boy.  My bread was a little stale - it happens.  It seemed like we had to wait an awfully long time for the beignet to come out.  I know they're fried fresh, but I've also made them before, and I know it doesn't take 15 minutes.  Overall, I had a great evening, and I would go back.",

The staff is so friendly and helpful and the coffee is expertly prepared. There are always fun events going on and interesting community things happening. The food is decent, but not amazing. Also, the furniture is not the most comfortable. I enjoy going here to grab a cup of coffee and get on with my day.",

We got to try so many menu items, and all were amazing. The Philly Cheesesteak Pizza was my 10 year old's favorite. I loved the Cauliflower pizza...so buttery and garlicky and delicious (vegetarian). We also got to try the carmelized onion-smothered wings which were out of this world. Also tasted: meatballs, ribs, salad...all very good. We ordered off the menu a half and half pizza with pepperoni, sausage and mushrooms. So good. If they had liquor on the menu I would have given them five stars (I'm just not a beer or wine person). Thanks for a great evening Anthony's! We'll be back.",

    "text": "This weird restaurant bar has it going on. A small, simple, delicious menu allows for a greater amount of focus to be spent on making a few foods excellently instead of many foods with medicority, which is an idea some other indianapolis restaurants might want to get in on. \nBefore we went my boyfriend and i did that 'hey, wanna try bites of each others tacos?' thing where we think we'll get two different things and then try each others. I got shrimp, he got chicken and our buddy got pulled pork. I asked my boyfriend if he wanted a bite of mine and he sort of pulled back and said 'no, i mean, obviously we're going to be coming back, so we can just try a different type next time'.\n\nDude loved his chicken taco. And I loved my shrimp taco! I hear the pulled pork tacos were also pretty magnificent. The chips and guacamole were delicious, but for the price I would like a little more guacamole. The spicy rim margarita really hit the spot and was a great accompaniment to the tacos and, at $5.50, i think they were reasonably priced. (I had 5) but what I don't like to see with any margarita is a bartender pulling out a jigger and measuring precisely two jiggers of booze. For that, you get four stars, revolucion. live a little! get me greased up, liquored up, super slick and oil my gears!\n\nThe fried potatoes were pretty 'meh', but the 'pink death' hot sauce was killer. I think it removed a layer of my tongue while still managing to be flavorful, so that was pretty stellar. So now in a Rocky Dennis fashion, I will break down for you the 'Things that I love'\n\nThings That I loved: (the sun on my face)\n\n-affordability\n-deliciousness\n-freshness\n-an atmosphere where you go, eat your taco and then sit around for a few hours drinkng because it's just a chill place to be.\n\nThings That I Didn't love: (the sun on my face)\n\n-Not being a bit loose with the tequila\n-mediocre taters\nhaving to wait in line every time i wanted to order another margarita. Like I said, I drank 5 and a daquiri. Every additional margarita meant me waiting in line to order it. That's not so awesome. \n-THEY WOULD NOT MAKE A MOJITO! get out of here with that!\n\nBut we will definitely be frquenting!",

The benton bacon goes so well with the burger than regular bacon. It is crispy and when you bite down the burger, you don't have to use your finger to break the bacon nor eat the entire piece. So definitely recommend you try benton bacon!\n\nThe chili chili bang bang is excellent, especially the Chipotle aioli jalape\u00f1o gives a bit kick. \n\nThe burger buns are good, not the super chewy kind the Pharmacy has for its burger.

What he described the place to be was spot on.\n\nIt is very eclectic with random decor and music.\n\nThe bartender was on point and the rest of the staff seemed friendly enough.\n\nI ordered the Big Jerk sandwich and the Caprese, but asked to have that as a salad instead of a sandwich, which they had no problem doing. Both were good with the Caprese stealing the show.\n\nThe food:\nThe Big Jerk was flavorful and the meat was very tender (pork). It was a little on the dry side even tho it came with a dipping sauce. The caramelized onions were a little on the sweet side. The pickle spear that came with it was not your standard \"dill spear\". It is homemade and very fresh, just lacking a little zest, but still good.\nThe caprese rocked. The balsamic reduction, cubes of Moz, diced tomatoes and sunflower seeds was a winning combination. I will definitely get that again but next time I will ask them to scale back on the size. Way more than I needed.\n\nNow for the good stuff: The house beer, \"Phat Beer\". I'm not big on IPA's or local brews, but this one has won my heart. Somewhere twixt a Bud and Bud Light but with a lot more flavor and a little pinch on your tongue.\n\nThe only reason Phat's didn't get five stars was because of the Big Jerk. They need to freshen that up a little.\n\nFootnote:\nPhat's needs to upgrade/separate the restrooms. The women should not have to deal with what the men leave behind. They also need to upkeep it on a more regular basis.\nThey also definitely need to get an exhaust hood over the griddle.",

The menu isn't extensive, but it's got a good amount of inexpensive sandwiches, salads, and soups.  \n\nTheir Cuban Sandwich ($10 w/ side) was pretty excellent.  The bread wasn't the traditional panini-style, but a French baguette...it was still great and had a little crispness to it.  All the main ingredients (meat, mustard, pickles, cheese) were in good balance.  As a Florida boy who loves his Cuban sandwiches, I would definitely recommend this.\n\nI also tried a bit of their Royal Grille, a grilled-chese sandwich with several cheeses, as well as apple slices, on whole grain wheat bread ($8.50 w/ side, extra to add ham/turkey).  It was damn good and hit the grilled cheese craving just right.  A side salad was also done well.\n\nFor my side, I chose their \"spicy carrots\" which sounded unique.  It consists of sliced raw carrots that have been marinated in a tangy dressing with crushed red pepper, served in a cup. The carrots were cold and crisp and the flavors were fantastic.  The spice was just enough to be pleasant.  I would definitely get these again.\n\nOur food came out super quick and our service was great.  I'm looking forward to trying a couple more items and bumping this up to 5 stars.",

    "text": "Mr. B's.  Yes.  I was walking back to my car from ACME, when I spotted a fisherman who was parked and selling his fresh shrimp catch to a chef out on the street.  I took one quick look at his catch and found the most wonderful looking jumbo shrimp I had ever laid eyes on.  Not your standard jumbo, but real JUMBO.  Huge tasty looking shrimp!\n\nI was compelled--even though I had just gorged myself on chargrilled oysters and a po'boy--to inquire about these shrimp of his.  I asked him, \"excuse me, sir, where is the absolute best place to eat those shrimp of yours around here?\"\n\nHis answer: \"Mr B's, you have to try the BBQ shrimp there for sure\"\n\nWho dat?  Mr B's dat.  My convinced my coworker (which wasn't to difficult) to come with me to try the BBQ shrimp.  We quickly sat at the bar, as we had already eaten lunch, and requested an order of BBQ shrimp to share.\n\nWhen the shrimp came to us, and we took that first bite (after peeling the shrimp, of course), we found ourselves in decapod heaven.  They were served swimming (no pun intended) in a delectable buttery/spicy sauce, which was truly amazing.  The smokey and spicy flavors of the sauce were infused into the shrimp, which is truly no small feat.  The best part about a sauce like this is that it seems to build in nuance and intensity with each bite.  Each shrimp, as a result, seemed better than the one just before it.\n\nI was so amazed, that I returned the very next day for another order of BBQ shrimp, to be split with a different friend.  I take great pleasure in sharing the things I truly enjoy with friends, and what better way to do that than over a bowl of BBQ shrimp at Mr. B's?",

    "text": "Met a couple of clients here for dinner and really enjoyed my dinner! We started with the calamari and the burrata with prosciutto wrapped breadsticks. The calamari was very fresh and the burrata was good, but the breadsticks were hard to eat with the cheese. They also brought us a plate of bread to dip and I ended up using that instead. They have a very nice wine list with a map of where the wines come from in Italy. I did not personally recognize many of the types and was hesitant to order a bottle for our table. I think it would be nice if they had wine flights of the wines so one could become more comfortable with them. Our server was very helpful though and we ended up choosing the Pinot Noir from Willamette Valley, Oregon because you can rarely go wrong there. I started with the minestrone and then tried the Contadina pizza. It was amazing. I was so full by the time it came I ended up taking most of it home, but it heats up well! Our server recommended the in house made pasta, but we all ordered the pizzas. I'll have to check them out next time!",

We ordered the duck, and I'm sure they just reheat it, but they do that well. The duck came out with a slightly crispy skin. Yum! Their beef stew with tofu is also very authentic. The only thing to make it more so, would have been if they served it in a clay pot. \n\nDefinitely one of the better Chinese places in Reno!",

Behind the display of goodies there was a table with clear plastic cups filled with yumminess, labeled \"cake scrapple\" I was intrigued. They were different kinds of cakes and icings, most likely left over from a bake. There were about 5 different flavors to choose from and I went with my favorite Red Velvet with cream cheese frosting. I also ended up with an M&M cookie, my other fave! It was a nice day so I sat outside on their bench and had a couple bites of goodness! The cookie was great, soft & chewy with those hard candies for texture. The cake was also delicious and moist!",

Got the family special of large pizza, buffalo chicken cheesesteak and wings with a 2 liter.\nThe pizza itself was better than average.  There was a good amount of cheese on the pie.  The sauce was tasty and well seasoned.  It seemed like it had a hint of anchovies in the sauce.  Either that or garlic.  The wings were excellent top notch.  Very hot even though it was take out which was hard to do.  With several flavors to choose from we got the naked honey BBQ.  Thy were meaty and massive.  I def would return for the wings.  A good sign upon walking in were the empty boxes of liscios rolls outside.  The roll of course was fresh and soft while the chicken was chopped breast meat with a spicy hot sauce and Gorgonzola.  Good sandwhich but not overfilling.",

What we found was a busy place that actually knew how to operate with a full house. Our need were quickly satisfied with courteous and reasonably priced service. \n\nSince we were just two, we were quickly seated. We started off with a couple Highland stouts. It was a nice drink and at a reasonable price. Before our entree, we shared a large garden salad. It was fresh and flavorful. The dressing was a bit on the heavy side for a vinaigrette. \n\nFor entrees, I had the Black and Blue burger with fries. The burger was just incredible. It was perfectly cooked. The blue cheese was not overpowering. The bun was soft and fresh. The side of regular fries were crisp and lightly salted. Even better, they went perfectly with the homemade ketchup. I'm not a fan of ketchup, but theirs is very nice since they seem to avoid adding too much sweetness. My son had a basic burger with sweet potato fries. I tried the sweet potato fries and think they might be some of the best I've ever eaten. The burger looked as good as mine and my son concurred. \n\nThe burger was well made and consumed within minutes. No words were spoken as we ate. Always a good sign. We shall return.",

And the epitome of fast food is Taco Bell. \n\nI just had their Beefy Crunch Burrito, XXL Grilled Stuft Burrito, and a Meximelt. I shudder to think how may Weight Watchers points I just ate.  But it was goooood.  I hadn't been at this particular Taco Bell in a long time.  It's nice and clean, service was fast and the staff behind the counter very courteous.  \n\nI'm not going to debate the merits of Taco Bell food as Mexican food.  I've had authentic Mexican food, and this is obviously not it.  If you are looking for authenticity, something like Miguel's or Carmelita's or Vallarta's is a lot closer.\n\nThey do have some healthy options, which I recall from a while back and was nice to see them again.  Their \"Fresco\" items basically remove the cheese and sour cream and stick to salsa and lettuce as toppings.  It is actually possible to eat a couple of Fresco Tacos and stick to a strict Weight Watchers diet.\n\nI'll try that tomorrow.",

    "text": "ML Rose has always been a favorite burger dive bar of mine, though I tend to visit the location on Charlotte Avenue. When my work declared happy hour at this location, how could I not resist beating rush hour traffic to order my favorite craft beers?\n\nNow, I'm a fan of porters and stouts, so ML Rose never disappoints. This time, I ordered the Highland Black Mocha Stout from Asheville, NC which went down ever-so smoothly. It was quite frankly like drinking velvet. I've had the Japa Milk Chai stout in the past and was similarly thrilled. ML Rose is to beer as Nashville is to country music: it is the definitive marker of what beer goes. Period.\n\nIf you happen to be a huge fan of bar food, this location does not disappoint. I particularly appreciated the generous portion on my Carolina Sweets order. So, let me explain this magnificent paragon of culinary achievement: perfectly crunchy sweet potato waffle fries hugged by dollops of pulled pork, all smothered with a carolina mustard bbq and kissed by a few diced green onions. Talk about food that hits every tastebud high note: savory, sweet, sour, and (with a kick of hot sauce from your table) just a bit spicy. I suggest saving the entire plate for yourself because you will not be inclined to share. Trust me, this dish inspires selfishness in us all. While I have tried the Five Alarm Burger, I admit that what truly sticks out is the Caroline Sweets dish due to satisfaction alone. Bar none.\n\nBecause we did come in such a large party, I do believe the waitstaff struggled to handle the numbers. Beers were delivered late or could not be ordered due to busyness, orders were forgotten or delivered to the wrong people. Common mishaps considering the huge party that we made up. However, the quality of my food and beer were still spot on, despite my beer gazing at me from afar (for far too long). \n\nI would suggest the Charlotte location if you are looking for a less busy location, but this one is fun since it has a lovely beer garden in the back. Eat, drink, be merry at M.L. Rose. It's diner paradise for sure.",

    "text": "A great spot to take out-of-town guests. I take all my Chicago friends here and they fall in love. The burgers are incredible and the boozy shakes are like no other. The first time I had horchata shake I honestly had dreams about it for like a week. It's also super centrally located, a quick walk from Wash Ave and other downtown attractions. Great vibe, although I always prefer to get a table upstairs than sit at the community tables on the ground floor.\n\nThe burger selection is really, really great. You can pretty much get whatever your heart desires. I've had mac n cheese patties on my burger, you can get a bison burger, turkey burger, literally anything. I have tried a ton and have never been let down by the flavor combinations. The waiters are always super honest, in a good way. If you ask them what's better, X or Y, they're not going to jerk you around and say they're equally good. They'll give you their honest opinion. LOVE that. \n\nAnother unique aspect about Bailey's Range is that they have a burger showdown (can't remember their technical term for it) where last week's featured burger goes up against a new burger recipe. It's a cool call-out that you don't see at a lot of other restaurants. \n\nThe only reason I gave it a 4/5 star instead of 5/5 is because I've had a couple of instances (out of MANY visits, so it's really not alarming or anything) where I requested my burger medium or medium-rare and it turned out a little well done. I still ate it, but it wasn't really what I expected.",

    "text": "Aside from a few negatives, I really enjoyed this place. Mizu is at the end of the Washington Street bars across from Prime 1000. We had a reservation for the night but were seated at the table right by the front door. The hostess (who I think was the owner) understood that this was problematic as the door closes slowly and it was under 20 outside. When another table in a better part of the restaurant opened up, she reseated us. \n\nOur server was very nice and accommodating. We started off with an appetizer of dragon balls and seaweed salad. Both were very good. The server also brought a complimentary order of miso soup. \n\nFor our entrees, we had the Imperial Roll, Volcano Roll, and salmon skin hand rolls. The Imperial Roll and Volcano Roll both are served over a plate of fire which makes presentation unique. Although the Volcano Roll was good, it was exceeded by the flavor in the Imperial Roll. It had an open BBQ taste which was unique for a sushi roll. \n\nPrices were adequate for what we received especially since we were eating off of Washington St.  For all of the items above (no drinks) we spent ~$60 plus tip.\n\nIf you are looking for a downtown spot for sushi, Mizu offers a unique experience with a large selection of items and good service. The only negatives are parking (as with all the Washington establishments) and the seating. I know it seems petty but the whole place gets cold when that door is open. Even in the new seats at the other end of the restaurant we could feel a draft. My GF wore her coat throughout the meal.",

It didn't disappoint--everything was delicious and lovingly presented.  We ended up ordering the goat cheese and basil bruschetta (mild but tasty); figs stuffed with blue cheese and served over prosciutto (rich and pungent); calimari (which I didn't try); fennel sausage (tender and flavorful); two of the cheeses (one was an amazing triple creme; can't remember the other one); and the chocolate torte.  The cheeses (which are listed on a separate part of the menu--make sure not to overlook them!) are served with sliced bread and are paired with various toppings.  Ours came with fresh honey and some kind of tapenade.       \n\nIt's somewhat pricey but not exorbitant, which we had anticipated.  The bill came to $80 for five small plates, a cheese board with two cheeses, and two glasses of wine (i.e., a moderate amount of food for dinner for two people).  You could obviously tweak this depending on your appetite, your budget, or your mood.  It would be a great place to just drop in for a snack. \n\nWe ate at one of the cafe tables on the sidewalk, which made for a really pleasant evening.  The service was good but was attentive to the point of being slightly overbearing.  But on the whole this was a very fine meal.  Thank you!",

Tavern has a ton of TVs, so it's great for watching a game. The bartenders were pretty quick to provide drinks as we waited, and the craft brew and cocktail menu is good. There isn't a very expansive selection, but what's available is diverse. The food is pretty stellar as well. My mussels were delicious and our nacho appetizer was great without any meat. Fresh jalape\u00f1os, black beans, and the perfect amount of cheese made them a delight. Our server is what missed the mark. She was courteous for sure, but her timing was really off. It took a while for us to order once seated and she altered between smothering us or ignoring the table. I also wasn't impressed with my friends' lamb tacos. The tacos come in an order of two or three, and this place seems to be stingy with the meat filling. I'd definitely recommend a side an order of three. \n\nAll and all, I'd come back.

We explained that we would be there for the game and we were pacing ourselves and her response was \"the whole game, well you better be constantly ordering if you are going to take up my table.\"  I totally understand her concern, and we assured her that we would in fact be ordering beers and food throughout the game.\n\nA few moments later she walked through her section complaining and cussing about the $1.00 tip she received from her table, again, I understand her concern, but there is a time and a place.  She then cleared a table and came to take the order of the people next to us, and placed the dirty plate of shrimp peels on the table, gross.  While our beers sat empty she sat down a few tables near us and had a 10 minute conversation with her friends that were dining there.  Another table sat down and again we heard the same speech about not talking up her tables and that they had to order all night (glad it wasn't just us).  At this point, our beers had been empty for 20 minutes.  \n\nMy friend went over to the bar, found 2 empty chairs and I asked her for our check.  She knew we had planned to stay all night and asked why we were leaving, and I was happy to tell her that we were not going to take up her table.  Our check was $14.00 and I left $24.00 hoping that she would take that act of kindness and extend it to the poor patrons who had to deal with her next.\n\nNow.... Onto the experience at the bar... TOTALLY AMAZING.  The bar staff that was working on Friday 4/19/13 made our night.  They were friendly, informative, suggested what yumminess to order on the menu!  Over all, those 4 gentlemen negated the unfortunate experience on the other side of the restaurant.  \n\nThe food by the way... the crab fries... yum'tastic!  My friend ordered the \"red\" mussels and I had the \"bleu\" mussels.  I feel like we ate all night long and never put a dent in them.  Absolutely amazing.  If I am ever back in Philly... I will 100% be visiting the bar at Chickie's and Pete's!!",

The last time I was there the bbq was really under-par, the ribs were really tough, the sausage was mediocre at best, and the potatoe salad was just plain gross. Thankfully - that's what was on my boyfriend's plate, not mine. \n\nThe enchiladas on the other hand were amazing as always. I wish I could buy the enchilada sauce so I could put it on everything, plus the fried egg on top (which I first thought was a very odd addition) is cooked to perfection with a beautifully running yoke. Although I still think it's a little annoying that if you order them with a meat it comes on the plate almost like a side, the dish is still my favorite.\n\nPlus the happy hour is pretty on point - half off on margarita pitchers that aren't scrimping on the booze, sounds good to me.",

I love the little Trojan horse that's just inside the door (it's big, but \"little\" compared to the size of the original).\n\nI've been coming here for years, and the good has always been great. The kabobs are awesome (I usually alternate between the chicken and spicy beef), and come with nice sides of Bulgar and vegetables. The pita bread is absolutely amazing, and is made fresh when you place an order - it's a great appetizer (I recommend the red pepper sauce, or the hummus). There's a meal for two people that's great to get if you haven't been to the restaurant before, as you get to sample a few of the dishes.\n\nLast night we took 6 other couples to Sofra (8 of us total) - we lucked out as a group of 8 had canceled earlier in the day (reservations on the weekend nights should be made 4-7 days in advance). The other couples absolutely loved their meals, and said they'd definitely be back again.\n\nI knocked one star off because I feel the prices of some things are a bit expensive. Their baklava, which is absolutely delicious, sells for $8, and you get 4 small pieces. Yes, I ordered it every time I go, but it's still priced higher than it should be. I'd budget about $35-50 a person depending on whether you get alcohol and dessert.",

    "text": "Yes, this is a Whiskey Bar, but if you go in and just order booze you're making a terrible mistake. \nI took my boyfriend a few months ago and when we went, the crowd was generally in their late 20's - late 30's with a Hipsterish vibe. We were seated in front of the door at a small table which... admittedly did pose a few minor inconveniences. My boyfriend ordered a Whiskey Sampler, we split an appetizer, and we each got a sandwich... and we tried to play tetris to make it all fit and ended up using the table next to us until we were done out appetizer. As it was winter, every time the door opened we got extremely cold, and since we had winter coats that we kept on the bench behind me, when the next couple was seated at the table next to us we were so close that I had to scramble to try and compact our coats as much as possible and sit on them just so other people could sit. (Not to sound like a slob or someone that needs so much space, its just a super small area that would better suit one person rather than two and might use one less table to create just a little more breathing room)\nBut the food was incredible. We got the cheese fries with oxtail to split, and I got the fried chicken sandwich. Mouth-watering good. We also got the Salted Caramel Bacon Cream Puffs for dessert and they were so good! It's a bit more expensive than what we usually opt for, but for a once in a while treat, it's definitely a place we'll go back to. Highly recommended!!",

Well worth splurging for them. \n\nMy friends were drawn in by the awesome looking burger they had, and indeed the burgers were all they hoped for. It came with a generous portion of crispy fries. But if you want anything else besides the $17 burgers, expect to spend over $30 for your entree. While the ambience feels and looks casual, it is fine dining.\n\nUnfortunately, the waiter did sell the shrimp and grits with the additional crab as \"heaven in his mouth\", but that it was not. I've had better shrimp and grits in Atlanta, and there is no reasonable way you should be paying $30 for shrimp and GRITS. Without the crab, it was still over $20.\n\nBut everything else was great. Drinks were delicious. Everything came out pretty quickly. Oh, when we mentioned we were visiting from out of town, the waiter was nice enough to give us a complimentary appetizer of the cool pizza to start. It was great but the name is hard to say or remember. And the rabbit and chicken liver pate was super worth since it comes in a huge mason jar.\n\nI recommend sticking to the drinks, appetizers, and burgers and you'll be a pretty happy camper.",

Plus, this place was super close to our hotel so it made it a logical spot to dine.\n\nSince all of our meetings have been later in the day and catered, we are given lunch, but we have had to go on our own for breakfast/dinner each day. Tuesday was our first stop in at Caf\u00e9 Beignet (311 Bourbon Street). To no surprise, this place was jam packed and we're guessing that most of these people here are tourists (after all, this is Bourbon Street and we are from out-of-town ourselves). \n\nAll of the menu items are less than $10 and are all very tasty. I had the Cajun Hashbrowns on Tuesday and loved them so much that I returned again this morning to have them again. The \"Southern Breakfast\" (eggs, grits, bacon and bread) also looks good, but the hashbrowns had me coming back for more. They are loaded with Andouille sausage, onions and peppers and served with a side of scrambled eggs and bread. \n\nHad never sampled a beignet (NO-style donut with powdered sugar) and ordered one to go with my breakfast. Then another. And a third. Holy cow, these things are addictive!\n\nThe coffee is good as well. Hey, we're from Minnesota and we like good, strong coffee. \n\nThere might be better places to get breakfast in the French Quarter but Caf\u00e9 Beignet successfully filled our bellies during our stay in New Orleans.

    "text": "Dearest Reader,\n\nPlease allow me to hereby confirm the rumors: Village Whiskey does, in fact, have the best burger in Philadelphia. And, I should note, some of the best bartenders. \n\nAs my wife and I sat at the bar waiting for our friends to arrive, I marveled at the infinite selection of whiskeys and bourbons. I decided that this, self, is the day you will begin liking whiskey. So I petitioned the bartender to \"make me something awesome with whiskey in it.\" \"What kind of drink do you want?,\" he inquired. \"I have no idea, good sir. You see, I am a neophyte, a tyro, and fledgling when it comes to spirits such as these.\" (Perhaps my banter wasn't quite at this level at the time; I was already a few drinks in from my visit to Franklin Mortgage, but this is how I remember it going.) So, he thought about it for a while and proceeded to mix up the craziest drink I had ever seen -- it had whiskey, orange bitters, an egg white, Portuguese red wine, and other stuff in it! The verdict: delicious. I also had the \"The Commodore\" off the drink menu, and it was very good, too. The drinks are a little pricey here, and they will set you back around $11 or $12 each.\n\nWhen our friends arrived, we were seated outside and I got to try to village burger and the short-rib and cheddar duck-fat fries. The burger, which comes with an artfully restrained dollop of homemade thousand island dressing, was unbelievable. The applewood bacon and the dressing served the elevate the already-incredible taste of the meat. I can't wait to come back and order another one. As for the fries, they were very good, but I think next time I will stick with the plain duck fat fries. Our friends ordered those, and they were super crispy and delicious.\n\nWarning: this place gets insanely busy, so you might have to wait a pretty long time for a table. \n\nAll in all, the drinks were great, the food was delectable, and the staff was very knowledgeable and personable. I would totally come back.\n\nStill dreaming of that burger,\nChris M.",

    "text": "Excellent food! We had such a complicated order for hibachi, and they were so gracious. We had four tofu and vegetable, one vegan, and one chicken hibachi. For the rice, we had one without butter or eggs, four with butter but no eggs, and one with eggs and butter. As you can see, we were totally annoying. But our server and chef were so accommodating.  Our chef, Tanaka, was great...and the tofu was AMAZING. We also had miso soup, noodles, vegetables, and fried rice. Everything was great except the vegetables, which were pretty bland. We also got a side of mushrooms, which was a waste...not flavorful at all. Portions were big. Service was great!",

BUT i would really suggest to the owners / workers for everyone to work on their customer service and attitude. Hence missing a star. A couple of times I have walked in 10 minutes before they close to get a to go order - they seemed annoyed. Other than that this place is ACES! If you go get the chicken gyro with a salad of pasta salad. go good! Everything is always crazy fresh tasting.",

    "text": "Located at the Farmers Market in the French Market district. You basically order at the counter then pick up your food. There are a few patio tables/chairs where you can dine in as well.\n\nDefinitely get the peel and eat boiled crawfish and bbq shrimp!!! Freshest crawfish I've ever had and doesn't have an aftertaste that lingers. If you've never had crawfish, make sure you research how to open 'em up before you try 'em cause you'll be missing out. These crawdaddies are cooked with some vegetables (celery and onions) and it does have about a 6/10 spice to it; so I wouldn't recommend it to those who can't handle spice very well. I believe the market price was $12/lb so a bit pricier than other crawfish joints in NOLA. The BBQ boiled shrimp was very tasty as well! It came with bread drenched in garlic butter. My boyfriend and I also shared the crawfish beignets which were okay, it felt like they were sitting out for awhile waiting to be picked. These crawfish beignets resembles a hush puppy with a few pieces of crawfish tails inside. I would probably pass on them next time. Make sure to order yourself a side of fries too to sorta help fill your tummy up!\n\nIf you're trying out the peel and eat, make sure to bring some wet wipes/hand sanitizer to use right after. Restrooms are a bit tricky to locate. I believe the closest restroom would be in the flea market area of the French Market District.",

I was really happy that the barista asked me about sweetness level because I didn't realize they allowed customization.\n\nThe mango, I will probs not get again.

He even still had his chopsticks in his hands!  Once the chef shook his head at him, he walked away.\n\n\nMy husband ordered the \"all raw feed me\" for $60, which was 5 dishes.  They were all crafted with a lot of thought, tons of flavor, and precision in the plating.  The last dish was New Zealand king salmon, which came in fresh that day.  All of the fish was super fresh.\n\nThe portions were VERY SMALL- more like a tasting.  He was still hungry afterwards.  I got the dumplings, which were very delicious and also the \"monkey\" salmon dish.  It was good as well, but the portions again were small.  All of the fish was sliced thin and small in size.   \n\nI'd say go once to experience LUVI, but if you like to eat sushi/sashimi like we do, find another place.  It's too pricy for what you get.",

I ordered the jambalaya pasta and my bf ordered a pound of crawfish. It took a really long time to get our food. My food came first before the crawfish and oysters. I was halfway through my meal when the crawfish finally came out. My bf finished the crawfish and then the oysters came out last, a little weird, but at least everything was really good. \n\nThe oysters were fresh, the crawfish was amazing. We really enjoyed how they make their crawfish here. It was seasoned just enough, but you can still taste the freshness of the crawfish and it was super sweet and juicy. We eat a lot of crawfish back in Cali, but having it here in NO, you can't beat it. I also liked my jambalaya pasta as well, it was tasty, but nothing special about it. \n\nOverall, we had a really good experience. The restaurant is right in the heart of Nolo. So definitely a good place to check out.",

To our pleasant surprise, there was zero wait! That alone earns you a star, Biscuit Love! In addition, the self-serve sparkling and still water machine is a nice touch.\n\nI ordered the Princess with an egg on top. Trust me, hot chicken and eggs for breakfast is a gorgeous & delicious thing! I devoured the entire meal in very short order. \n\nThe only problem I could find was the coffee. It tasted burnt and left something to be desired. Then again, if you are going to Biscuit Love for its coffee, you're doing it all wrong!\n\nFrom what I can tell, this location is something of a \"locals secret.\" I did not see any obvious tourists here. If you ARE a tourist, though - welcome to Nashville! I highly encourage everyone who reads this review, locals and tourists alike, to visit this location instead of the one in the Gulch.",

They seem to not have enough people working there to keep up with all of the people and orders. On a more positive note, their sushi is some of the best I've had. (Pok\u00e9mon Go roll is addictive.) Their beef Korean tacos are delicious and huge. My daughter gets the sweet potato waffle fries and finishes them, she never finishes anything except for those. I recommend this place for the food but go there expecting to wait a long time for everything.",

    "text": "Fireside Pizza is located in the \"historical\" downtown part of Palm Harbor..it is another of a new breed of restaurant that I have noticed is starting to pop up around the state in that it's a high end wood fired Pizzeria that also serves high end beer and wine..this is definitely one of the better ones I have been to...first the beer menu is fantastic...whomever is choosing it knows their beer...lots of great \"national\" craft beers from Founders..Stone..etc, but than many stellar local ones from the likes of Cigar City ..7th Sun..etc...as for the food, everything I have had so far has been great...salads are done well....the hot wings are cooked in the pizza oven and served with crunchy onions on them..these are worth the trip here alone...the pizzas have all been good as well..the wood oven gives the thin crust a crunchy snap that is tough to match...pepperoni and sausage version has received high praise, but my personal favorite is one of their specialty Pizzas, the Parma, which has prosciutto and arugula on it..just fabulous..if I was just rating on the beer and food this place is a 5 star all the way...the only problems I have with Fireside are it's pretty small inside and outside on the patio so there is not much seating, so as you can imagine the wait times can be pretty long on a lot of nights...even calling in takeout orders we have been quoted one hour plus pick-up times ,obviously due to the fact they are crowded and the brick oven can only hold so many pizzas at once...the crowds and the fact that the servers here always seem to be in a grumpy mood(maybe due to always being busy) makes me have to deduct a star...well that and the fact that last time we were there the utter chaos in the parking lot at the Redneck Bar across Nebraska had all of us Diners on the patio at Fireside hoping we were not going to end up as collateral damage from the rapidly escalating conflict!!.... Fireside is definitely a recommended spot if you like high end Pizza and Craft Beer and don't mind paying a little more for such high quality fare..just try to go at an \"off\" hour and watch the parking lot across the street to make sure \"All's Quiet on the Western Front\" and you will have a great meal and time",

Since I was a kid, I grew up with my best friends' family who are from Calabria. Their mom and grandma (spoke no English) would spoil us with the very beat home made Italian food I've ever had. She used to make multiple pizzas every Saturday...and placed a huge emphasis on the dough. Any true Italian always uses good bread and good dough for their food. With that being said, Vincent's is the best Pizza you can find outside of south Philly or center city. Very good dough and good use of cheese and sauce. Marras in south Philly is probably my favorite in the city.",

    "text": "Stopped here last week while in the area from Burbank. Had read about it on Trip Advisor. It is in a great location, quiet, peaceful and cool under the shade of the big old trees. For its location and it being noon on a Thursday we were surprised to find there was literally only one table open when we walked in. Food is served pretty quick though so it didn't seem anyone was really waiting. \nBased on reviews we had read, my hubby had the tri-tip sandwich. I ordered the buffalo burger. I have to say that was one of the best burgers I have ever had in my life. As usual, we traded tastes of our orders. My hubby was so jealous of my buffalo burger and I heard about it several more times throughout the day, that he should've got the burger. The tri-tip was quite dry, and it was literally just the meat on bread, big bread.  The horseradish sauce (served on the side) was very tasty though.\nFor the tri-tip, I give a 3, hubby gives a 4. We both give the buffalo burger a definite 5++.\n\nEither way, worth checking out if you want something with a unique atmosphere and that is away from town but not a long drive. Very peaceful.",

We dragged our hungover asses out of bed and walked in here with hopes of eating some delicious food and a well needed dose of caffeine. We each got started with coffee, which was absolutely fantastic. I ordered the southern breakfast and requested toast instead of sausage, while my friends ordered the soft shell crab and crab omelet. I loved the food I ordered.. except everything lacked a little seasoning. Also, the bacon was completely dry. I love bacon in any shape or form, so I didn't seem to mind the lack of grease. The jalapeno grits were spectacular and so was the biscuit. My friends seemed to really enjoy their breakfast as well. The fries again, lacked seasoning which seemed odd. How does one forget to add salt to fries? We were too hungover to notice or care.. Overall, its a pretty good place if you're looking for decent French food.",

So I assumed when I got the arroz con pollo with chicken, rice, and mexican sauage (which was delicious) that it wouldn't be spicy enough.  I so stupidly didn't even taste it and asked for some hot sauce, which they brought me in a dish.  It looked like Franks Red Hot, so I dumped it on.  Big mistake.  The hot sauce was SO SPICY (which unbeknownst to me, they charged me $1 for).  It was so hot that I downed 5 glasses of water, had tears in my eyes, and couldn't finish the rest of my meal.  On the plus side, I was stuffed from water and hence, didn't overeat!\n\nThe service here is really fantastic.  The server was so friendly and kept our water glasses filled.  We had a groupon ($15 for $30) and although it didn't say it on the groupon, the server told us that it came with a free dessert!  We got the crepes with bananas, caramel, and fresh berries which was tasty.   You also get free chips and tomatillo sauce, which was great.  The place is BYO, takes credit cards, and they offer different margarita mixes w/ your booze.  They have a private room upstairs which is great to reserve for large groups.",

I really enjoyed the appetizers (dumplings in chili oil) and the entree (garlic chicken).  I know, I know, I was looking for noodles and ended up without.  I think this was mostly because as I was looking at the menu, plates kept going by me, steaming of fresh, Chinese wok flavors. I couldn't resist but to try a little of this and a little of that.\n\nMeal was hot, fresh, flavorful and an excellent recommendation.\n\nOn a down side, as I have noticed on this trip, the customer service, servers, waiters don't seem too excited to be working.

We arrived at 8:45pm, and knew they would be closing at 10.  \n\nI've loved the concept of B&B since I heard about it - literary favorites transformed into delicious food and drink options is a super creative approach.  I also like that this is a family friendly environment, with fun drawing of Shakespeare on the wall and tons of board games to choose from.\n\nUsing our Membership, we decided to go for a flight of 4 beers each since we were not familiar with their goods.  Between the 8 different options, the only one I'd say I wouldn't order again was the Ice and Fire Sour - they have a series of them and I'm sure the others were great, but this specific one was an interesting Scotch Ale that was soured.  Our server said that \"it packs a punch\" and she wasn't kidding - incredibly rich and I would love the Sour Scotch if it was split into a Sour and a Scotch Ale.  The SO enjoyed her Blonde and Hefe the most, and if it had been a bit earlier in the night we might have stayed for a few more drinks.  \n\nTable service was a great touch, and they offer select bombers, cans, and growler fills to go in addition to a nice little selection of merchandise.  We didn't venture upstairs but it seems like a great space that can accommodate large groups and have lively atmosphere.  They had live acoustic music last night, but things were dying down a bit by the time we got there (he was great! Bring him back!).  \n\nNote - if you live in the area, B&B has a Mug Club where they do discount fill nights in cute ceramic pint glasses.  I almost bought one to take home.",

It was great! the soup had tons of vegetables and chicken, just the right amount of heat and the corn bread is pretty big and delicious.  \n\ntheir chi latte was not impressive.. do not get it. lol \n\nlittle pricey but, it's a great place to have a wonderful breakfast/lunch and the workers are nice and friendly. \n\ncheck this place out, let me know what you guys think.",

    "text": "Ordered from here for the first time tonight. I got jalepeno poppers which were by far the best i've ever had, although they were a little pricey.\n\nI also ordered a small plain pizza, and after I finished off the poppers I opened up the pizza and realized there were mushrooms on it.  I was alright with that, to me I just got lucky with a free topping, but if it had been some kind of meat I would have been pretty bummed (I'm a vegetarian).  The pizza was really tasty, Crust was a little softer then I prefer but it was real good. I will definitely order from here again, maybe not for a little while just cause it is more expensive then other places.\n\nAlso delivery was fast, and the guy called me right when he got to my house. A big problem I have with delivery places is when they call before they actually get to your house, cause I live pretty far out in the ghetto and I don't like standing around outside after they call... but these guys were right out front when they called me.",

They agreed to cook it while we waited, but when we got home with the food, half of the dinners were not correct.\n\nThe next day, I called and asked to speak with the owner/manager who got on the phone. He profusely apologized and explained the reason for the ordering snafu. He offered to re-do the order as a comp. A few days later, we ordered take-out again and he made good on his word.

Katie's is a neighborhood place, and everyone's super friendly. There's plenty of street parking, so no worries about parking meters or anything.\n\nThe food was yum! What we had:\n\n-Crawfish beignet: spicy with a hint of sweet, creamy (cause of the cheese), all highlighting the crawfish goodness :) I liked the marriage of flavors.\n\n-Atchafalaya pizza: topped with seafood goodies :) the crust was super thin and overall delish! the grilled garlic adds a very nice touch (I LOVE garlic).\n\n-Fried green tomato and shrimp poor boy: I'm sorry New Orleans, but after trying different poor boys from different places, I decided that I just don't like poor boys in general :(... so my opinion for this one would be very biased...\n\nMaybe it's cause at dinner time I eat really healthy most of the time (fish, or veggies, and fruits only), but I ended up with a huge tummy ache :( though I enjoyed my time here, I hate having an upset stomach after eating... or maybe it's cause I'm slightly lactose intolerant -.- oh why do I do this to myself?",

You can't miss with this spot as a date night locale - always delicious, and cozy. The menu has changed very little over time, and it's not overly extensive, but they often have a new \"special dessert\" or special of the day. Be warned as their favorites do run out, so the later in the day you go, items may not be available. Their carrot cake is pretty good, moist and not too sweet. Located close to local schools and Webster University, this is often a place to go to escape those \"regular\" establishments. #AsianLadyLikes",

    "text": "Honestly this is my favorite place to get pizza but there are a few little issues that keeps me from giving it 5 stars. One is how much everything costs, it is worth it but I still feel like the only reason why I don't order there often is that sometimes the good stuff is around $30 for one pizza. My other reason is that sometimes the food will get to you undercooked and that is based on how many toppings it has since they seem to put  all the food items in the same oven for the same amount of time.",

She was great. Losing a star for the hostess. Told it would be 45-60 minutes for a booth to accommodate a party our size. Not a problem. Then I see three tables on the outdoor patio. I tell the hostess we would take those and they don't have to move them they are close enough that we would be good. She tells me she had to get with the manager. Holy crap you have to ask the manager ??  What, to accommodate customers and feed them in a restaurant ?  She came back and moved the tables together, which we didn't ask her to do. And man was she ever pissed about it. She didn't say anything but you could see it on her face.",

    "text": "Excellent food and bar. Slow service.\n\nA friend and I stopped here during an evening of bar hopping in the CBD. We were seated promptly and given our menus, which are half-French, half-English. Not a big deal for anyone who can read French and/or has been living in Louisiana for a reasonable amount of time, but definitely something tourists should be wary of. I didn't have any alcohol because I was the designated driver, but I can say that their drink menu is extensive, and the bar was packed from the moment we arrived until the moment we left. \n\nThis restaurant's biggest strength is it's food. I tasted their crab bisque, and had Poulet Grand-M\u00e8re as my entr\u00e9e. Both were excellent. The latter arrived in a wide cast-iron bowl, which I'm sure has a more proper name, but was an interesting touch nonetheless.\n\nThe service was why I gave this restaurant 4/5 instead of 5/5. Most of the wait staff seemed to be interns from culinary school. The handful we dealt with were very friendly, but would do well to be a little more attentive. For example, the server who brought us our desserts ran off before we could ask for spoons to eat the dessert with. \n\nIn summary, a good dining experience, but I think I would rather continue exploring new restaurants in the area before returning.",

    "text": "Dropped by for lunch after church because we were craving burgers.  Love the atmosphere and we got there before the rush.  Rustic wood and metal made the dining room feel warm and contemporary.  Music was hip and a few beards could be seen.  The bull horns over the bar and the abstract cow scene paintings felt like a ranch house.  We ordered the Black and Blue burger medium and the Salmon burger medium.  The salmon burger was visually and texturally perfect and a moist and tender medium but under seasoned.  The quality of the salmon was good and flavor was clean.  The Black and Blue burger was cooked perfectly and seasoned.  I like the buns, brioche style buttered and grilled so they are soft and crispy.  On a side note they served home made ketchup and Heinz so the kids have something familiar.  The home cut fries were great as usual and with the truffle oil made them perfect we also tried the special side which was a roasted red potato and grilled okra salad.  It had a mayonnaise base with seasoned salt sprinkled on top which was good but not my favorite.  I liked that the okra was left whole but may be better with the mayo seasoned with the seasoned salt.  \n\nOver all I like Burger Up they are consistently good but wish they would season as they cook.  The staff are friendly and the restaurant including the restrooms are clean.  Jeremy was our server, he was there when we needed him and close by when we didn't a perfect balance that allowed us to enjoy our family lunch.",

Next up were the steak fajitas.  They had a nice taste and the spice they used was just right.  The onions were heaped on the platter but there were so few poblano peppers as to be almost nonexistent.

    "text": "We took a break from Sesame Place and ate some real food here before heading back to Elmo for a final beating, aka: The Sesame Parade and Fireworks show. \n\nIf this wasn't the sweet haven of amazingness between furry monsters and sweat, I really cannot attest to what the heck a sweet haven is. \n\nI ate steak, delicious steak, instead of a grilled cheese at Elmo-Bites. Because I found out that Elmo can really bite. He is a monster after all. \n\nThe servers are so great with kids and yet you sit in that swanky dark mahogany bar atmosphere and feel like you are human again after a day at Sesame Place. I actually think JB DAWSON's is the reason we went back after our dinner. I downed my steak and two beers, looked at my adorable 3 year old who was quietly coloring on the kid menu they have, turned to my husband and said, \"Wanna be parents of the year, and take her back to see the parade?\" Swiftly, he responded, \"Let's do it. Go big or go home.\"\n\nAll the waitstaff works together here too. I don't know if they pool tips, but it's like some sorta family feeling they give you as if the waitress' big brother just took over her shift so she could go help mom in the kitchen. So rare to find fast, efficient, and dependable hosting like that in a restaurant these days. \n\nBeing from New York City and eating at an array of places over the years (with plenty of annoyed waitstaff), this place reminded me of Gorgios of Gramercy in terms of atmosphere and service. And it was child friendly which always scores well with me.\n\nMy only constructive criticism: my newborn has a dairy allergy and an overwhelming majority of the dishes and sides have butter, milk, or cheese in them. They made me a beautiful plate of steak, but all the higher priced sides I was supposed to get, I could not have. So I paid the same amount for two less filling sides....basically steamed broccoli (which was actually amazing) and fries. An additional side of something small like corn or rice, would have made it even-steven. But I loved my meal. I'd go back.",

Definitely cheaper in Old City. Anyway, the food was great. Fresh and hot and huge portions; neither of us could come close to finishing. Only food complaint was the bacon was way under cooked; needs to be crisper.\nBy the time we left, the place had started to fill up, so get there early for a spot. Definitely will return.",

I really liked the fact that their lattes and cappuccinos have beautiful latte art on top. The store has a beautiful modern design that reminds me of coffee shops in New York. \n\nThis particular location is in Hyde Park Village. The benefit is that parking is free. The down side is that seating is limited. The store is also extremely cold, so it is uncomfortable to sit and socialize for very long. You may be better off getting your coffee to go and walking around Hyde Park Village instead.",

    "text": "A very upscale and respected chain, with a short list of cities to allure with their prime cuts of meat and their fresh seafood. Philly is lucky to be one of those three cities! \n\nThe bar melds perfectly inside the restaurant and does not make you feel like it is the \"bar\" area. Tables fill this room for dining or having a cocktail. One step up and to the side is an elevated floor, where we sat.  Beyond the \"bar\" area that you walk into, is a more secluded dining area, but we were center stage and had a great view of it all. \n\nHubby and I ordered and shared three appetizers. We loved them all, but I was partial to the escargot and the oysters Rockefeller and he to the clams casino, so I did not mind letting him finish the clams while I devoured the other two appetzers. We did skip salads, but hubby enjoyed the wonderful lobster bisque, of which I found exceptionally good, with my one snitched spoonfull. \n\nMy husband had the Prime Rib, what else? I love filet mignon and they have in house made bearnaise sauce, so I stuck with what I love best and it was a huge, juicy and tender portion, very good indeed. \n\nThe restaurant has a lot of class and prices are what you would expect. \n\nWhat I loved most about the service, for such an upscale establishment, the wait staff was not at all uptight. The waiters were professional, but with charisma and humor and knew how and when to have conversation. \n\nBottom line, I would go back in a heartbeat!\n\nWheelchair accessible with ramp through main entrance into the lobby of the hotel and entrance right in through their door.",

Being my first time having an event at my home, I was particularly interested in everything going smoothly.  The waitstaff explained what hors d'oeuvres were being passed and were very friendly.  I couldn't have asked for better!  The manager did a great job too.  Unfortunately, the bartender was not familiar with Manhattans or Old Fashioneds, which I specifically wanted.  Every time anyone asked for one she had to refer to a recipe or ask how they were made.  I had requested a specific bartender I had met at another party.  She was guaranteed to be my bartender but she was replaced by another at the last minute without anyone notifying me.  She was available but was pulled off at the last minute for another party.  I was very peeved by this and called the party planner.  They apologized and tried to make it right.  For a cost of $2,200 they reimbursed me $80.  Not exactly wanting my business I guess.",

    "text": "The new Han Dynasty took over the spot where the old Mid-Atlantic restaurant (with the unchanging menu) was. I like the Han Dynasty here a lot more than the one in Olde City even if I give both 4*. Maybe I'm biased, because I love the service here. They've always been very nice, and came over to check in with me and just make some small conversation when they heard I had a peanut allergy (even though they had no peanuts in any of the dishes I ordered; I think it was Han's sister?). I've been to this Han Dynasty more times in a month than the number of times I've been to the other.\n\nNote though, that the different branches have different specialties. I heard the dan dan mian in Olde City is the best, but the one in UC isn't so good (I wouldn't know since it has peanuts). Overall, I think it;s okay food wise, still not spicy enough as with the other branch. But I like the layout and atmosphere a lot more.\n\nNext, if you go during lunch, you can ask for lunch portions, that are smaller than the dinner portions, and half the menu price! So it's a great lunch place too, alone, or in a group of 2 or 3.",

This may wind up being one of my more regular haunts as I slog my way through more of their menu (I think I may need to heavily modify next time I'm there), but so far, I have no cause at all for complaint and much to celebrate. It's interesting to me that the environments of the various locations are different, sometimes vastly, yet all have their own unique and innate charm. Whoever is running these is doing a phenomenal job, so props there.\n\nOne thing of note here...the ordering system is extremely clunky and seemingly disorganized and I sort of dislike it. Not enough to stop coming here, since I really dig the vibe of these, but on one of my less patient nights, that sort of thing may be enough to cut this out of the running. Definitely a good spot for pizza and a brew (or several), though. I back it.",

It's more of a treat spot. \n\nMy husband ordered the banana fosters French toast which he loved! And I ordered the crab omelette with a biscuit. My omelette needed a tad more salt but the biscuit was phenomenal. Everything was just so heavy. I tried originally ordering the jumbo crab meat salad but I was told that they didn't have any jumbo crab. So I was stuck ordering an omelette. I'm sure if you come here for lunch the options are a bit less heavier. They do also offer a variety of fresh juices but that's not what I want to order at 8 am in the morning. I want food but the kind of food that doesn't weigh me down for the rest of the day!\n\nEither way, the staff is very friendly and welcoming. And this restaurant has a very fun vibe to it!",

The only improvement could be in selection- I would love to see some whole wheat everything bagels, or multigrain styles.\n\nThey also sell doughnuts, which are good, very good, and fresh... but not great. Then again, I have been to Doughnut Plant NYC, which was basically life-changing, so again, bar set high. But it's a nice bonus when I'm picking up bagels to bring home a treat.

Was I setting myself up for utter disappointment, or was I going to be enlightened?  White pizza is not exactly the most complicated-looking pizza around, but I only know of one other place that makes a few versions of it spectacularly (Top Tomato in Philly!!!).  \n\nAs serendipity would have it,  I received two pizzas on this date night: one which I had ordered (prochuitto gourmet pizza) and the other that was free (Il Giardino white gourmet pizza) because the free one was apparently sent to my table by accident -- yay!!!  It was a wonderful surprise, because the pizza was fantastic.  The white pizza that eventually came out for me was also very delicious and is definitely in my top 3.  \n\nThe atmosphere, I must add, feels intimate not just because it was small (I would say that it's 1/10 the size of The Olive Garden) but because on this Thursday date night, there were people who were enjoying themselves around their respective dinner tables like families, even if they really weren't in the same family.",

    "text": "Delicious! \n\nI wish they took reservations, but my friend and her fiance go there nice and early so that we could snag a seat inside (it was cold out!). \n\nWe ordered the bianco salad ( to share between 2) and the western addition (to share between 4).\n\nI thought the salad was tasty but nothing special, despite the white chocolate shavings. Cute idea, but not enough crunch or pizazz to make the salad seem really fabulous.\n\nThe pizza, however, was pretty darn good. We ordered it deep dish to try their special cornmeal crust and were pretty impressed. \nThe crust tastes a little bit like cornbread, a little bit like pizza dough, a tiny bit like grease (the good kind) and a lot like YUM!\n\nI don't know if it was the best pizza I've ever had, but it was very good. It would be even better if it were a tad cheaper, and didn't get so crowded! But definitely worth a visit if you're in the area!",
