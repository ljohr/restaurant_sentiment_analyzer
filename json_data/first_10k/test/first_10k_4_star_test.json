    "text": "The bun makes the Sonoran Dog. It's like a snuggie for the pup. A first, it seems ridiculous and almost like it's going to be too much, exactly like everyone's favorite blanket with sleeves. Too much softness, too much smush, too indulgent.  Wrong. It's warm, soft, chewy, fragrant, and it succeeds where other famed Sonoran Dogs fail. \n\nThe hot dog itself is flavorful, but I would prefer that it or the bacon have a little more bite or snap to better hold their own against the dominant mustard and onions. \n\nI'm with the masses on the carne asada caramelo. Excellent tortilla, salty, melty cheese, and great carne. \n\nSuper cheap and you can drive through.",

Everyone from the servers to the bartender is very knowledgable about the menu and was able to immediately recommend items I could eat as-is, substitute or delete to make something safe for this Celiac girl to eat. The wine and cocktail menus are spot on. The food divine.  My only wish is that they would have a gluten-free dessert, we've always had to go elsewhere for something sweet.

    "text": "The only reason I didn't give this restaurant a 5 star rating, is because of one single pretentious waiter. As a 4 night guest at Hotel Palomar, the location of the restaurant is an obvious plus. The first night of my stay, I met a coworker in the restaurant for a cocktail. When we arrived, the host staff were busy and not available, so we just walked in. The restaurant was not too busy, so we just looked at a small table next to the bar and proceeded to take a seat. A waiter came by and I quickly asked if we could have a seat, before sitting down and told him we'd only be having cocktails. He stumbled on his reply, and in an irritated/in-convinced tone, told me \"I guess it would be fine\" and basically just kept walking mid sentence. My guest and I brushed it off, and started having a conversation while looking at the drink menu. To make a long story short, he was distant and we both got the \"couldn't be bothered\" vibe from him. When it came to the bill, we asked if it could be split due to company transaction policies, and you would have thought asked him for some inconceivable task. We basically spent the rest of our night and elevator ride to our room in shock of the rudeness we had just experienced. \n\nAlthough that situation left a bad taste in our mouth, and the night before we decided to avoid the restaurant, we decided to grab another cocktail and give this place one more try. After looking around and ensuring \"last nights waiter\" wasn't on shift, we walked over to the bar and started looking over the menu. Instantly, the bartender greeted us with pleasant small talk and made us feel 100% welcome. He asked about our day, recommended cocktails and was a completely genuine person. This guy (I think his name was Ben) is an absolute star! He gave us lessons on Whiskey, described how to make classic cocktails, and was 100% invested in our experience. This is exactly what a bartender at a 4/5 star establishment should be - actually he exceeds that. He was kind, funny, friendly and completely redeemed this restaurant/bar from our terrible experience the night before. \nI also ordered room service last night from this restaurant, and it was amazing. The bacon wrapped dates and chocolate cake are to die for! Great restaurant and amazing bartender(s). Too bad one bad egg could have spoiled this experience.",

    "text": "It was my fiance's birthday and he decided he wanted a good, laid back Thai restaurant for dinner. Yelp steered us in the Jasmine Rice direction, and it was definitely a good decision. We wanted the summer rolls, which were on the menu, but apparently will not be available until summer, so we settled on the pan-fried dumplings. The flavor was good, but I don't think we'd order them again. We got the green curry fried rice with duck and chicken pad thai. Both of those dishes were great, but the duck stole the show. That was some the of tastiest duck I've ever had. The pad thai was a bit sweet for us, so I think we'd try a different noodle dish when we return. But it was still very good, especially with some chili sauce mixed in. Our service was good, but other people had issues. One table was rushing to get to a show at the Kimmel Center and waited quite a while for their meal (and were going to be late). Another person who got take-out was missing one of their items (but the owner realized it and called him and walked the dish to his house, which was very nice). Overall, good quality Thai! We would definitely go back.",

This place also makes getting down and dirty with your food easy. There are sinks all over so you can rinse the mess off your hands once you're done....good touch.\n\nTo sum it up, Chickie's and Pete's is a Philadelphia institution and always a good time. I strongly suggest going at least once to enjoy the experience. \n\nPlease note: Make sure to remember two things before coming during major sporting events. 1. You'll never get a table and 2. You'll deal with a ton of drunk people. I've absolutely been one of these people before and we can get annoying unless you're in the right frame of mind. :)",

They grill their steaks over oak and citrus Wood and the smoky flavor is to die for! We are big fans of our smoker back home and cook our steaks this way as well, it's rare to find steak cooked over woodsmoke in most places and this was worth the side trip!  Sides were veggies and sweet potatoes. The wines on offer were so reasonably priced- most under $20 a bottle but a decent selection. They just don't mark them up 5x like most places! \n\nOur waitress Lisa also made great recommendations and her service was welcoming, friendly, and excellent.

But today I could smell the roast beef and so I got that one. Yum. Good portion of sliced beef that was beyond medium cooked with cheddar cheese and a yummy horseradish sauce. Nope, don't get lettuce or tomatoes on it. It's perfect the way it is.\n\nAnd since it's right between the security station and the top of the D gates (right near the Delta SkyClub!), it's easy to get and eat at the gate or on board.",

    "text": "This was my first time dining at Ava and I enjoyed most of it. We ordered the Ricotta cheese & toasted bread and although the flavor was excellent, I thought the bread to cheese ratio was off quite a bit. The ricotta came in a tiny ramekin typically reserved for flavored butters, so I expected more for an appetizer. \n\nThe two pizzas split among a couple of people were the sausage and the potato with rosemary. They were both tasty but I think they forgot the Rosemary on ours. Still yummy, tho! Another entree was the grouper w/Israeli couscous. Scrumptious!\n\nDessert was a must and the zeppoles, or sugared donuts, were amazing. The cherry tart a little less so, but one person at our table loved it, so maybe it was just not my cup of tea. The cherries were a sort of candied cherry-interesting, but sweet with a very dense crust. Again, just not my personal fave. \n\nI will definitely return to try other menu items that looked great-like the pastas made in-house daily...that's next!!",

Behind the display of goodies there was a table with clear plastic cups filled with yumminess, labeled \"cake scrapple\" I was intrigued. They were different kinds of cakes and icings, most likely left over from a bake. There were about 5 different flavors to choose from and I went with my favorite Red Velvet with cream cheese frosting. I also ended up with an M&M cookie, my other fave! It was a nice day so I sat outside on their bench and had a couple bites of goodness! The cookie was great, soft & chewy with those hard candies for texture. The cake was also delicious and moist!",

In fact, I felt a little rushed.  All the locals were running in, saying hi to the owner and ordering up their usual's.  No place for a rookie, but they were extremely patient with us and a few others that wandered in not knowing what they were doing either.\n\nAs soon as you cross the threshold, you know you have made a good choice, the smell makes your mouth water.  The Punk agreed so we decided to sit inside (everyone else was outside).\n\nTypically, I would never ever order pastrami, but the menu said it was lean, so I tried something different for me.  Lean indeed.  Best pastrami I have had in a very long time.  In fact, maybe ever.  \n\nThe punk was amazed at all the bottle caps glued to every surface in the place.  It is a visual feast to keep you busy and entertained while you eat, if you choose to eat inside.  You cannot see the walls for all the nostalgic fodder.\n\nShe was especially thrilled when they brought out her sandwich. When he set it down she exclaimed with delight, \"He knew exactly what I wanted!\"",

    "text": "Thank you for a lovely morning!  I was in NJ early and decided to stop in for a delicious diner breakfast.  I got a taylor ham, egg, and cheese and a short stack of blueberry pancakes (I simply couldn't decide between sweet or savory, plus leftovers are never a bad thing).  \n\nThe egg sandwich was fantastic.  I was nervous when they said they didn't have kaiser rolls so I went with a hamburger roll.  It was an excellent decision.  The roll was excellent - not just an average cheap hamburger roll.  They layered the cheese on the sandwich, which to me is a must for a true egg sandwich.  It was served with home fries, which were sauteed with large slices of peppers and onions.  I'm not the biggest breakfast potatoes fan, but these were great and I appreciated that they didn't clearly just scoop some food from a huge pile of pre-cooked home fries.\n\nThe pancakes were great and fluffy.  My one gripe was their use of smuckers pre-packaged syrup.  I realize that if they put syrup in a container, it probably wouldn't be real maple syrup, but I sort of wish I didn't know that they were giving me sub-par syrup.\n\nThe server was friendly and very attentive.  The coffee refills were constant, and the coffee was actually good (so many diners fail at coffee).  Bonus points for the server agreeing not to judge my decision to get two breakfasts.\n\nAll around, I loved this place and hope to go back soon.  Long live the Jersey diners!",

I like the Han Dynasty here a lot more than the one in Olde City even if I give both 4*. Maybe I'm biased, because I love the service here. They've always been very nice, and came over to check in with me and just make some small conversation when they heard I had a peanut allergy (even though they had no peanuts in any of the dishes I ordered; I think it was Han's sister?). I've been to this Han Dynasty more times in a month than the number of times I've been to the other.\n\nNote though, that the different branches have different specialties. I heard the dan dan mian in Olde City is the best, but the one in UC isn't so good (I wouldn't know since it has peanuts). Overall, I think it;s okay food wise, still not spicy enough as with the other branch. But I like the layout and atmosphere a lot more.\n\nNext, if you go during lunch, you can ask for lunch portions, that are smaller than the dinner portions, and half the menu price!

There isn't a ton of seating but it also isn't close to the TSA area so it's a bit hidden. Hey have TVs if you wanna catch a game while you wait for your flight. Food is very reasonably price for the portion size. Appetizers run from $5-$10 and majority of sandwiches are $12. I didn't order any food but it looked amazing! Drinks are tasty and Prices are not terrible. Think 22oz Jai Alai for $8.50. You cannot take alcoholic beverages into the terminal (Columbia does this I think). I had a Manhattan for $11 and it was very tasty. Staff is attentive and friendly. I know my new spot when I'm waiting on a Delta flight!",

It was good, but the whole Sonoran hot dog isn't really my thing (too many components for me) so I can't say it was great. The guacamole on the other hand, was great! I also had the taco combo - the chicken and carne asada were very good but the cabeza was slimy. BK has a salsa bar that allows you to help yourself to your own toppings and I appreciated that. Service was good, food arrived quickly. It was pretty packed during lunch on a weekday.",

I order with chicken as the protein but they have the typical options for this .  The portion was good for lunch and had good flavor.\n\nFor dinner I ordered the chicken satay to start and the Panang Curry with chicken for main course. I was very disappointed in the satay being that you only get two small skewers. The flavor and peanut dipping sauce were very good but they give a few more skewers.  The Panang was good and you get a good size portion of rice.\n\nOn a side note, I was disappointed they do not have Pad See Ew. Still some other options on the menu I will return to try.\n\nThe staff and manager really know customer service.  Look forward to returning soon!",

    "text": "A great spot to take out-of-town guests. I take all my Chicago friends here and they fall in love. The burgers are incredible and the boozy shakes are like no other. The first time I had horchata shake I honestly had dreams about it for like a week. It's also super centrally located, a quick walk from Wash Ave and other downtown attractions. Great vibe, although I always prefer to get a table upstairs than sit at the community tables on the ground floor.\n\nThe burger selection is really, really great. You can pretty much get whatever your heart desires. I've had mac n cheese patties on my burger, you can get a bison burger, turkey burger, literally anything. I have tried a ton and have never been let down by the flavor combinations. The waiters are always super honest, in a good way. If you ask them what's better, X or Y, they're not going to jerk you around and say they're equally good. They'll give you their honest opinion. LOVE that. \n\nAnother unique aspect about Bailey's Range is that they have a burger showdown (can't remember their technical term for it) where last week's featured burger goes up against a new burger recipe. It's a cool call-out that you don't see at a lot of other restaurants. \n\nThe only reason I gave it a 4/5 star instead of 5/5 is because I've had a couple of instances (out of MANY visits, so it's really not alarming or anything) where I requested my burger medium or medium-rare and it turned out a little well done. I still ate it, but it wasn't really what I expected.",

I mean like my last meal on earth would be a burger. Or, just maybe, the fajita wrap. Because it's that good.\n\nHaven't had everything on the menu yet, but everything I have had has been great. The buffalo bella and crispy hipcity ranch are amazing sandwich alternatives, especially paired with the green lemonade. The groothie is also delicious, and can stand on its own to get you through an afternoon if you only want to spend a few bucks.\n\nOkay suffice it to say that the food is great. The staff is also very friendly, and when they get busy someone will come out along the line and take orders so congestion doesn't get too bad at the register itself.\n\nMy only issue with HipCity is that it is at times nearly impossible to figure out where to stand when you're waiting to order or waiting for your food. People kind of convene everywhere and it can get awkward when there's a line out the door. In such a small space it's hard to rectify, but if I see a line out the door I tend to walk on by not because it's a long wait (they're really efficient), it's just difficult to navigate the interior.",

    "text": "This review is mainly chicken talk as Cuenelli's Peruvian Style Rotisserie Chicken brings to the table. Pollo a la brasa.... Rotisserie chicken.... Whatever you wanna call it.... I call it a technique done here with love and pride. Lets be clear, you will find no comparison coming from your grocer deli section or at the checkout isle.\n\nWhy do I think this chicken have some TLC put into it? On biting down of this chicken you can note seasoning flavors down to the bone. This is an inclination that prior to even getting into the rotisserie oven, these birds spend some time in some form of marinating process. Building flavor, the chicken also has a seasoning rub all over the skin.\n\nLets go to this rotisserie oven. Another unique element is this oven has a charcoal or grill like component. This gives the chicken a smoky element in the flavor build. As these birds turn in this oven, they keep moist from the natural drippings dropping from bird to bird as they rotate through this oven. In turn, this a reason why some people may note some pieces the skin end up dry and crispy and others get moist or soggy skin on their chicken In the end, you end up with this tender, smoky, well seasoned, fall off the bone goodness. Wait.... how can they add more flavor? Cuenelli's serves it with two dipping sauces, a chimichurri  which gives a herbaceous and slightly spicy flavor, and an aioli which has a garlicky - lemony element.\n\nRound out this meal with some solid sides. Must haves for me would be the cilantro rice. Another herbaceous addition that works well with this meal. I got to use the word herbaceous a few times in this review, it has reflects such great imagery for food talk:) Must have beans with rice no? I pick the spicy pinto beans over the black beans at this establishment but lets be clear these beans are pretty spicy. I also love the maduros here. These sweet plantatains are cooked to perfection where the outsides has this caramelization from the natural sugar of the sweet plantain, leaving you with this toffee-like, stick to your tooth exterior and soft and sweet interior. \n\nWash all down with Inca cola or a bottle of chicha limena.  Inca cola is almost like a cola champagne or a cream soda type of drink. Chicha Limena I say is Christmas in a bottle. This juice has a floral base blended with cinnamon and cloves.\n\nThough Cuenelli's Peruvian Style Rotisserie Chicken have many other notable Latin dishes, the one thing that comes to mind to me is this chicken made with love. This chicken gives new meaning to all who thought they knew what rotisserie chicken is. I say, go to Cuenelli's and taste again for the very first time.",

Raw salmon and white fish with avocado and fish egg wrapped in cucumber with some sweet sauce. Perfect for those who is looking for no-rice roll. Salad dressing was more like carrot pur\u00e9e.",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I both decided to try Jesse's for the first time after we'd both grown up in the Brandon area and neither of us had ever been, and really hadn't heard much about the restaurant. \n\nWe dined on a Saturday night and even though the parking lot and restaurant was packed, we were sat right away at a 2-top next to a window facing SR-60. \n\nOur server, Nikki, greeted us in a reasonable amount of time. We ordered our beverages and she brought them shortly after that. Something I did not like was there was not a drink menu on the table, but Nikki was able to tell us what beers were on draft and non-alcoholic drinks. She took our appetizer and entree order all at once. \n\nWe ordered crab stuffed mushrooms and a French onion soup to share. These items came out together. The crab stuffed mushroom was basically a giant thing of crab stuffing on a TINY mushroom, which was almost laughable, but had a good flavor nonetheless. The French onion soup had a great flavor and wasn't scalding hot, which was super nice to eat right away. \n\nAfter our appetizer came out and we finished it, our Caesar salads came out as well as a loaf of bread and some butter. This was also really great pacing of our meal! Nikki never let empty plates sit on our table, was very attentive, and always made sure we had drinks in front of us. The Caesar salads were good. I gave the bread two chances... once dipped in the French onion soup and once just with butter on it... the bread could have definitely been better - it just didn't have a good flavor to it. \n\nI ordered the 6 oz filet and he ordered the 16 oz Delmonico - both cooked medium rare. The steaks are served with saut\u00e9ed mushrooms, your choice of side, and a salad or soup of the day, which isn't mentioned anywhere on the menu. I got broccoli as my side and my boyfriend got a sweet potato with all the fixings. I saw three tables sat after us receive their entrees before us - I don't know if it was a kitchen issue or something else, but we were sat at least five minutes before each of those tables - I tried to make sense of the delay, but it honestly wasn't a big deal to me. Our steaks came out on hot metal plates that were inserted into a cooler outer shell. My filet was nice and thick and cooked perfectly and the broccoli was steamed very tenderly, but there were not enough saut\u00e9ed mushrooms on the plate, in my opinion. If I had known it would have been like five mushrooms with the steak, I totally would have gotten them as a side. My boyfriend's steak was cooked perfectly as well, but being on the hot metal dish led the steak to cook more at the table, which he wasn't particularly pleased with. He enjoyed his sweet potato with butter, but it didn't come out with cinnamon on it like he requested. \n\nAnyway, I am sure we will return! Our server, Nikki, was fabulous. She was extremely attentive, had a great attitude, and was knowledgeable!",

But something that I crave everyday! \n\nThis particular Starbucks is great. The baristas are always friendly and welcoming. The drinks are made correctly and quickly. I usually go with a Salted Caramel Hot Chocolate or Mocha. I also occasionally order the White Mocha. If you can't tell, I enjoy coffee that doesn't taste like coffee! In the summer their iced teas are the perfect thirst quencher! Their breakfast pastry items are always delicious. Try the Cranberry-Orange Scone and you will not be disappointed! Their breakfast sandwiches are unique and pretty tasty as well.\n\nI always choose to go in and place my order over sitting in the drive thru. The line for their drive thru is always ridiculously long. It's usually quicker to go in!",

    "text": "Don't judge a book by it's cover.  Looked like a any similar bar food type chain like Friday's, Bennigan's, or Ruby Tuesdays... JB Dawson's is far better.\nAwesome experience from the second we stepped in, hostess greeted us with a smile and time to table waiting expectation.  We were promptly seated, and tended to right away with a smile and good attitude by a server, Nancy, who helped us with a beverage and app order.  \n\nFor our app we shared the twisted shrimp as it was Twisted Tuesday.  Nancy told us this dish far surpassed Bone Fish's Bang Bang Shrimp, to our surprise, it clearly did.  Our beverage and app shortly followed. \n\nShortly there after another server stopped by, Kyle, who was our designated server.  Boy, smile, great greeting, great attitude, engaging.  We talked a bit, figured our way through the menu and placed our order.\n\nFor our dishes, my wife selected the Four Cheese Mac & Cheese side -- Sharp Cheddar, Pepperjack, Mozzarella & Reggiano dusted with bread crumbs with cornbread as she had large lunch.  Very good.  Unexpected, light, not overly creamy, not burnt, just right.  And the corn bread with maple butter..... ahhhhhh that was really nice.\n\n I ordered the fish tacos-- 3 Flour tortillas, seasoned tilapia, chimichurri sauce, mango cilantro salsa & a lime cream drizzle.  Passed on starch sides and had their asparagus that was cooked to perfection.  To my surprise the they were filling, nice size portion (see photo)  not a two bite app.  Very moist and super fresh fish.\n\nGreat first experience all around expect one key aspect.  Their so called craft beer menu was really limited and did not contain a variety of types; focused more on IPAs.  Limited thinking for the bar manager I must say.  Kyle our waiter also bar-tends.  We got to talking and he offered with no questions to swap out my beer for another option --- Stoudts Scarlet, which is a reddish beer.  For my beer palette it was better then the others limited options had a nice taste at the swallow then waned off.   Kyle informed us that they buy for all 4 restaurants and try to find a middling that works across the 4 guest demographics.  Not a great decision honestly.  There are so many great craft brewers in the Bucks County region and even Bristol area that should be showed cased and tested through.  For me a bad or poor beer selection stunts the overall experience.\n\nWe'll be back but I may need to sneak in my own beer selections from my craft collection.",

It is always clean and the staff is always friendly. the reason I am giving them for star in that V is because they haven't done some of the necessary updates that other theaters have done by updating the seating offering wait staff service excetera. You can go to the Roadhouse theater for $11 with a student discount or 12 bucks, which is all required liners and heated seats and they have wait staff with a chef. The pricing is nearly the same at this theater but it doesn't have all the same perks. I believe they may have one or two theaters with upgraded seats but they really need to go through the entire theater and update it.",

He ordered two steak tacos and a side of rice. The beans are hands down my favorite I've had from a mexican restaurant.  My only complaint is that, unfortunately you do not get a very big portion. The salsa is so fresh tasting and delicious-very cilantro forward, and the chips were nice, thick and crunchy without being oily at all. Take note though, chips and salsa are not included with your purchase and must be bought separately. Now let me get to the best part-the made to order, chunky guacamole. The hardy chips would definitely withstand this heavy duty guac, but I opted instead for tortillas as my vessel to stuff it with along with my beans and salsa. The hot sauces were anything but, though admittedly my tolerance to spices may be higher than the average persons. While I had a great eating experience, my boyfriend did not. He said the meat was of low quality and quite flavorless. He did say he would give it another shot though!",

All of the ingredients taste fresh, and their bread rolls are amazing. They are nice and soft, not with that cut the roof of your mouth crust. Being born and raise in Santa Barbara, actually just down the street, I have been coming here for some years now. I've tried probably over half of their sandwiches and all have been good, so good it's hard to pick a favorite.  In addition, I cannot forget to mention their awesome soda selection, so awesome I cannot hesitate to try something different with every visit. You won't find anything super fancy or exotic, like a roasted duck pastrami sandwich here, but if you're a local or just passing through and feel like having a great sandwich with good fresh ingredients swing by Plaza Deli and grab a bite.",

Well worth splurging for them. \n\nMy friends were drawn in by the awesome looking burger they had, and indeed the burgers were all they hoped for. It came with a generous portion of crispy fries. But if you want anything else besides the $17 burgers, expect to spend over $30 for your entree. While the ambience feels and looks casual, it is fine dining.\n\nUnfortunately, the waiter did sell the shrimp and grits with the additional crab as \"heaven in his mouth\", but that it was not. I've had better shrimp and grits in Atlanta, and there is no reasonable way you should be paying $30 for shrimp and GRITS. Without the crab, it was still over $20.\n\nBut everything else was great. Drinks were delicious. Everything came out pretty quickly. Oh, when we mentioned we were visiting from out of town, the waiter was nice enough to give us a complimentary appetizer of the cool pizza to start. It was great but the name is hard to say or remember. And the rabbit and chicken liver pate was super worth since it comes in a huge mason jar.\n\nI recommend sticking to the drinks, appetizers, and burgers and you'll be a pretty happy camper.",

For its location and it being noon on a Thursday we were surprised to find there was literally only one table open when we walked in. Food is served pretty quick though so it didn't seem anyone was really waiting. \nBased on reviews we had read, my hubby had the tri-tip sandwich. I ordered the buffalo burger. I have to say that was one of the best burgers I have ever had in my life. As usual, we traded tastes of our orders. My hubby was so jealous of my buffalo burger and I heard about it several more times throughout the day, that he should've got the burger. The tri-tip was quite dry, and it was literally just the meat on bread, big bread.  The horseradish sauce (served on the side) was very tasty though.\nFor the tri-tip, I give a 3, hubby gives a 4. We both give the buffalo burger a definite 5++.\n\nEither way, worth checking out if you want something with a unique atmosphere and that is away from town but not a long drive. Very peaceful.",

Great food, creative options! Couple areas of critique: it was FREEZING (every woman had a sweater on in July) and lack of ambiance. The latter could be easily remedied with some decent background music, and better lighting? (Overhead office lighting is a drag, but large windows a plus) Customer service was good not great, tad disconnected...but it was a holiday weekend. Overall, a keeper. I'll def be back!",

We also got to try the carmelized onion-smothered wings which were out of this world. Also tasted: meatballs, ribs, salad...all very good. We ordered off the menu a half and half pizza with pepperoni, sausage and mushrooms. So good. If they had liquor on the menu I would have given them five stars (I'm just not a beer or wine person). Thanks for a great evening Anthony's! We'll be back.",

It was a beautiful afternoon, and a handful of people were scattered around the shop and the outdoor seating area, working on laptops and visiting with friends. \n\nI ordered a small cold brew with vanilla, easy on the ice. I added a hunk of gluten free zucchini bread (the bread butt; the best part!) to my order and paid with a credit card. They have a fancy touchscreen register that lets you add tip to your card purchase. \n\nI topped off my drink with whole milk -- which in itself was a real treat. It's so rare to see whole milk at the mixing station! \n\nBefore leaving, I asked what else they had in the way of a GF offering, and the young man behind the counter said \"just the zucchini bread.\" That's a real bummer; the zucchini bread is great but I'd love to have more than one option. \n\nMy drink was smooth and had a perfect flavor. I was happy with my choices. \n\nIf I lived in the neighborhood, I'd be here all the time. I like the hipstery feeling of this place, and everything I've ordered has been delightful.",

The wine bar area is small but had a very modern atmosphere.\n\nI started off with the Vina Vino wine flight and my friends ordered The Bold and the Beautiful. Both came on a cute wood/chalkboard board with the wine written in chalk. All the wines were very tasty but the Vespucci  Primitivo and the Il Fauno di Arcanum were my favorite.\n\nWe then ordered the fig jam and prosciutto, bleu cheese, arugula flatbread. A little heavy on the blue cheese for my liking but overall was really good. We also ordered the Farmers Platter. You can choose anything from 1-7 items and build your plate from a variety of cheese and meats. We selected the Brillat-Savarin, Cypress Grove \"Purple Haze\", Blue Brie, Spressata and the Italian Speck. The farmers plate also came with jam, mustard,  caramelized nuts and crostini. The Farmers plate by far was my favorite!\n\nOverall I really liked CRU. Its cute, quaint and cozy. Can't wait to come back!!",

We hadn't seen eachother since elementary school and got reacquainted through Facebook so this was a pretty special dinner. \n\nThe restaurant is very swanky and the prices show this.

It was not fantastic and there wasn't alot of seafood but it was adequate for me. I also ordered a Neopolitan Old Fashion which was made perfectly. \n\nMy friends ordered the fritters, carpaccio, crab cake and fries. Plus 2 shots of tequila, a lemonade and 2 more old fashions. Bill was $170 which is not bad but some of my friends weren't expected it. \n\nAnd I must say something about our waiter. Unfortunately, I didn't remember his name but he was fantastic! Very attentive, nice and even bought out a dessert because it was also one of my friend's bday.

It was delicious ( granted my first and only time) I believe it's pork and has hominy, lettuce, radishes,onions and they give you a small container of dried oregano. Not the biggest fan of the lettuce cause it's gets all wilted but add some hot sauce and it's a meal in itself!!! I got also got the taco lunch special (2 pork tacos and rice) and that was good. Besides the amazing service from the sweet lady, the salsa was way sweet! Wasn't the biggest fan but everything is def fresh! And the pineapple water is a must. I don't like pineapples but I read reviews and just had to try it and thank u guys!

    "text": "Dearest Reader,\n\nPlease allow me to hereby confirm the rumors: Village Whiskey does, in fact, have the best burger in Philadelphia. And, I should note, some of the best bartenders. \n\nAs my wife and I sat at the bar waiting for our friends to arrive, I marveled at the infinite selection of whiskeys and bourbons. I decided that this, self, is the day you will begin liking whiskey. So I petitioned the bartender to \"make me something awesome with whiskey in it.\" \"What kind of drink do you want?,\" he inquired. \"I have no idea, good sir. You see, I am a neophyte, a tyro, and fledgling when it comes to spirits such as these.\" (Perhaps my banter wasn't quite at this level at the time; I was already a few drinks in from my visit to Franklin Mortgage, but this is how I remember it going.) So, he thought about it for a while and proceeded to mix up the craziest drink I had ever seen -- it had whiskey, orange bitters, an egg white, Portuguese red wine, and other stuff in it! The verdict: delicious. I also had the \"The Commodore\" off the drink menu, and it was very good, too. The drinks are a little pricey here, and they will set you back around $11 or $12 each.\n\nWhen our friends arrived, we were seated outside and I got to try to village burger and the short-rib and cheddar duck-fat fries. The burger, which comes with an artfully restrained dollop of homemade thousand island dressing, was unbelievable. The applewood bacon and the dressing served the elevate the already-incredible taste of the meat. I can't wait to come back and order another one. As for the fries, they were very good, but I think next time I will stick with the plain duck fat fries. Our friends ordered those, and they were super crispy and delicious.\n\nWarning: this place gets insanely busy, so you might have to wait a pretty long time for a table. \n\nAll in all, the drinks were great, the food was delectable, and the staff was very knowledgeable and personable. I would totally come back.\n\nStill dreaming of that burger,\nChris M.",

    "text": "Wildflower is a super scrum, cute little restaurant. I've been here twice now for lunch, unfortunately I am always too late for breakfast. Fortunately though, their lunch is delicious! I took my mum here for her birthday for lunch and we were both so pleased!! \n\nSad to say, but due to some health issues, I've had to really change my diet around. This was my first time going out to eat since being on this new regimen. I'm definitely limited, which is too bad, and there was a lot I couldn't have. The menu has good selections, but there is a lot with meat, and I've been a vegetarian for years. Regardless, they serve great food, I just like big menus. Everything is made in house and they use fresh and local ingredients. My mum got the Vermonter salad, which she LOVED!!! It had mixed greens, Vermont cheddar, applewood smoked bacon, pecans, and dried cherries. The dressing was a home made honey vinaigrette I believe. It came with two delicious pieces of muesli bread with a home made honey butter. YUM!! I had the tuna plate, which was great too. It had a very good portion of tuna salad, mixed greens, mixed veggies, and came with a biscuit with that delicious honey butter. It also came with a fresh fruit bowl!!!! I couldn't have the biscuit so I traded for muesli and man that stuff was delicious. My mum loves the biscuit too. Everything is definitely made with love and happiness here!!!\n\nThe patio is so cute, 4 tables on a nice little deck with fans and hanging lights. Our server was wonderful, SO kind and adorable. She even brought my mum\na homemade red velvet cupcake with a candle, which LOOKED amazing, and she thought was delicious. Another win at Wildflower, would love to come back for breakfast sometime.",

We were quoted an hour wait, but were able to grab a high top in the bar area with no wait (they are full service).\n\nSpasso is Italian, but has its own little spin; it's not just the classic dishes of a typical Italian restaurant.\n\nThey start you off with bread and this delicious eggplant/pepper topping that is so refreshing. I typically love oil for bread, but love this alternative.\n\nI started with a Caesar salad which was perfect; just enough dressing, super fresh and I love the shaved Parmesan on top. For dinner I had pappardelle porcini which I think is the best item on the menu, it is thick pasta with sundried tomatoes, mushrooms and chicken with light sauce. It is totally delicious, and I had leftovers to have for lunch the next day.\n\nSpasso is definitely recommended for a great dinner in Media!",

The wait staff is always nice and the owner is often around to talk to.  Free dum dum lolly pops at the counter as you walk out and news papers to read if you are eating alone or want to check in on the Phillies.\nFood- always good. Great pancakes that are fluffy and crispy on the edges.

Sweet Confections is on Magazine St, around corner from the art gallery strip on Julia St.   We had a sampling of cupcake (chocolate with mocha filling) and truffles (raspberry, creme brulee, and orange).  Cupcake was good, mocha filling best part. Rasberry truffle was my fav, love the dark chocolate so it's not cloyingly sweet. The coffee was a wonderful chaser, not overly burnt, smoky, or acidic... I usually have coffee with milk n sugar, forgot this time, but I didn't even need it!  Seating was nice, with a few cafe tables inside. Enough for our 6-girl troop. And service was great, helpful with flavor suggestions and labelling.  Gave 4 of 5 stars because maybe they could benefit from one more equally gracious staff person.",

So I convinced my husband to do so. Here's how this 2nd chance went:: Absolutely wonderful. Chris asked that we let him know when we wanted to give the restaurant a second chance, but we decided not to. We didn't want any special attention. We wanted real unreviewed service.  We were seated in the bar because it was a very  busy night, regardless of that the server was very attentive and had a great personality. Our food came out in a timely manner, well prepared and delicious. We have since then been back several times and service continues to remain great.",

Perhaps too hip for many over 35 but if you can tolerate the boisterous and extremely casually attired youth--I haven't worn a suit in 20 years either but even 20 year olds should have something besides skinny jeans and T-shirts with borderline obscene slogans in their closets--the food is worth it and the staff copes well.   \n\nI had a 6:00 reservation (obtained the day before) but the sky seemed threatening a downpour so I came early to avoid it and was seated 20 minutes or so before the appointed time.  I often don't even make reservations and have no trouble getting seated at popular places by being there when they open or, for those open all day, coming before the popular dinner hour, but that didn't work the day before at L\u00fcke.  Even at 4:30 the place was packed so I did make one for the following day.\n\nMy meal started with the crispy Brussel Sprouts.  Even if you hate Brussels sprouts (I like them), don't be afraid to try this dish--if no one told you you might not know what you were eating.  They are in some sort of sweet/sour sauce/dressing and fried both slightly blackened and crispy as advertised . . . tossed with almond slices, small bits of jalape\u00f1o and sprinkled with shavings of cheese on top.\n\nThen I had pork schnitzel and \"pommes frites\" (that's shoestring fries to the Galliphobes).  It came with whitish gravy in a pitcher, I suppose to make it \"Southern\".  The gravy was good but I skipped eating it, doing that the usual way with a squeeze of lemon.  It was excellent and the fries were fine too.\n\nI finished with some excellent decaf and a glass of Kahlua--I had had iced tea with the meal so some alcohol was not an excess.\n\nA lady who was some sort of hostess dropped by my table while I was eating to make sure everything was OK and when told I needed ketchup (for the fries), went and got me some (in a dainty little single-serve Heinz bottle).  My waiter also checked several times but didn't hover.\n\nI am giving it 4 stars.  The 5th star is withheld because of the crowded dining room and noise level . . . nothing to do with the food which I greatly enjoyed.",

The beer is pretty good.  I wish they would do some more adventurous offerings, but I can still get a good beer here.  \nThe food can be a mixed bag.  I had a small pizza that was a gooey mess (mushrooms and hearty toppings need a thick crust for stability).  I love all the scotch egg offerings (you can get it on a pizza or burger here), but they are so salty.  The burgers are good. The desserts are great (please get the frangipane).  It's also great to get the ploughman's plate and a beer, and just relax for a bit.",

Zen Yai is a tiny place, which is both good and bad. Good if you don't have to wait, because it is nice and cozy, but bad if enough people eat here on a given evening -- because you may just have to wait a while.\n\nI like the decor a lot, and the use of colors. The tables and plates are full of refreshingly bright colors. \n\nThe service was fine, and the food was at our table in no time.\n\nMy Pineapple curry was excellent! And the rice is served in the shape of a pyramid, which is fun. \n\nAll that being said, my girlfriend had a less than pleasurable experience.

The other appetizers like Tuna Tartare and Coconut Shrimp each had awesome flavor surprises - fresh, melty tuna and a wasabi and jam sauce respectively - both excellent and plated beautifully.\n\nMy cocktail \"The Tryst\" didn't impress. Watery and a strange alcohol after taste. I'll forget it tomorrow. \n\nSERVICE\nThanks Yelp for introducing me here. It's easy to get overlooked at the bar, but once seated, our server was quick and helpful and was great at lowering my inhibitions by telling me what to expect in a \"vegetable\" beer they offered--spot on. \n\nSUMMARY\nI'll probably stick to the drinks only here because the food prices are above my range... or go during happy hours.

    "text": "Tried the Brew Bros. Burger challenge as a dare from friends. What are friends for? Though I came close to finishing all 4lbs of burgers, fries, and fixings, I fell short on time. Our server was kind enough to issue me a shirt for attempting and \"coming the closest to finishing.\" Whatever that meant. The food was good, staff was great, and the challenge left me with a stomach ache for 3-days. \n\nI did not get a chance to sample their beer selections but from what my friends said, it's good. I would not recommend the burger challenge if you're going to drink beer. Otherwise for $24, it's by far the best deal on the menu; especially if you split with friends! (splitting the meal violates the rules of the competition)\n\nIf I'm ever in the Reno area again, I will be back to conquer that elusive challenge!",

Definitely check out the squash casserole.  it was quite the tasty dish.  I'd also recommend their meatloaf, which is what I had.\n\nMy only complaint--and it's a minor one--is that they advertise cornbread.  Yes, it's cornbread, but not a slice of cornbread like you typically think of it.  People in the North would call it a corn fritter.  Being from KY, I'd call it a hoe cake.  It's cornbread but more like a cornbread pancake.",

    "text": "This wasn't my first visit to the Italian Centre, but my last visit was many years ago and all I could remember was the huge selection of charcuterie and cheeses. Slightly overwhelming to say the least, meats and cheeses (at the time) I had never even heard of. With some guidance from the staff I was able to select some delights. \n\nFast forward a few years... \n\nMy most recent visit was only for some pastries and a quick lunch, so I didn't have time to browse the huge selection of Italian delights. \n\nI decided to go with the Mossimo pizza. The toppings were fresh the cheese was bubbly! The crust was thin and baked to perfection. I wasn't expecting such a huge pizza- definitely big enough to share! And priced at just $14? A steal if you ask me!\n\nFor pastries we chose the Cream Horns; while they were quite pricy, they were certainly delicious. Likely made that day, they were fresh, creamy and flakey! Impossible not to over indulge! \n\nWhile visiting the Italian Centre I suggest enjoying a freshly crafted coffee beverage and a pastry. The perfect treat before or after shopping.",

We had the daily oysters which were great. Followed by the Brussels sprouts, delicious but the crispy chicken skins were a bit of a let down, they needed more flavor. \n\nThe smoked tuna tartar is great but the sweet chips can overwhelm the dish. Definitely get the marinated shrimp and jalape\u00f1o jus it is a wonderfully fresh and bright dish. \n\nTo close thing up we had the dobeger cake with lemon curd and chocolate ice cream, as if that wasn't enough they pour this amazing chocolate sauce on it when it arrives that will have you just dying as you wait to dig in.\n\nOverall Compere Lapin is a great addition to the New Orleans food scene, great for groups or date night with your significant other.",

    "text": "Not mediocre at all IMHO.  Makes me wonder if Daniel O. went to the same place we did.\n\nThis is a great neighborhood byob place that provides welcoming service and excellent food at a reasonable price.  We started going here because numerous South Philly friends recommended it.  This is not foo-foo Italian.  This is not pretentious Italian.  This is \"let's go back and work our way through the menu\" Italian.  We found the specials to be good choices.  My husband's broccoli rabe and sausage was excellent, as was a grilled romaine salad with bleu cheese and pine nuts.  Both were generous enough to share.  Last time, sausage & figs was a hit.  If you are in the mood for a basic plate of macaronis with red gravy, you won't be disappointed either.  We had a great time with the waitress because my BIL brought a bottle of Great Wall wine from China (that was the 2nd bottle we opened) and that started a whole crazy discussion.  She didn't know us from Adam, but we left there feeling like regulars.\n\nIt's a very doable destination if you are on your way to a sporting event at the Linc or the Cit, or to the Spectrum or Wachovia Center.  For those who rely on public transportation, you can get off the subway at Broad & Oregon, then walk back a block to Broad & Porter.  Make a reservation, though because it can be a popular place.  You also want to make sure you have time to have a relaxing meal and make your event in time.",

Nice, hard-working, mannerly people in a very cool atmosphere that appreciate the business.  Food is consistently fresh(seafood) and good.  Pizza is the best in South Jersey and my husband, the unofficial pizza 'officianado' makes me try them all, from NYC, to Trenton to Philly, Delaware, Chicago.  This is really the best pizza I've ever had. The crust is thin, crispy yet has a nice chew, and flavorful.\n\nLast night I had a dinner special of chicken cutlet in a lobster, white -truffle oil, light cream sauce with asparagus, shallots and sundried tomatoes over angel hair pasta. On the Special's menu it is listed as a veal entree, but the kitchen was more than happy to substitute Chicken for me. The dish was so delicately seasoned with such a fine touch that I enjoyed smelling it almost as much as tasting it. In addition, it was such a generous portion that I enjoyed it two nights later for dinner and now want to go back tomorrow and order it again!!  What an absolutely fabulous recipe. Very fine, subtle flavor but also comforting and satisfying. \n\nNot to mention, Selena the Bar Manger, bartenders Jayna and Chris are just so pleasant, professional and helpful, it really is a great place to go!\n\nEnjoy!!",

    "text": "If you are looking to be impressed by French-German dishes in New Orleans, please go to Luke Restaurant, I know I was. \n\nThe restaurant is located in the Central Business District, next to the Hilton and in the former Masonic Temple Building, so there is that historic vibe to the restaurant. The front room is a lot more grand than the back room (where we were seated), but that is offset by views of the open kitchen. \n\nApparently they only want to seat people with reservations, so since we did not have one, we were refused seating until 9:15pm (it was 6:45pm) but with a little back and forth, we ended up waiting only 15 minutes before we were seated. However, as we walked through the restaurant to the back room, way too many tables were empty that it made no sense that they acted that way. A lot of tables still remained empty throughout the meal.\n\nI decided to start out my meal with a cocktail. I originally wanted the Mint Julep but they were out so I had the Riverbend (vodka, lemon juice, basil syrup, blueberries & ginger ale) at the recommendation of the server. It was a relatively sweet cocktail, with the ginger ale being the most powering flavor, but you could still taste the alcohol.\n\nMy friend choose a regular starter and ordered a cup of the Crawfish Bisque. She ate all of it so I am assuming she liked it, but she did complain of a sour aftertaste.\n\nMy boyfriend skipped the appetizers and went straight for the entree. He always seems to find the most basic item on the menu and order it. He had the Luke Burger (bacon, caramelized onions, tomatoes, Swiss cheese) and was raving about it. One thing I can tell you, it was a very good size. \n\nMy friend had the Jumbo Louisiana Shrimp \"En Cocotte\" with lump crab meat, roasted jalape\u00f1o cheese grits, andouille & green onion sausages. She loved it.\n\nI have an obsession with mussels so I had the classic Moules et Frites. Although only having two simply ingredients (garlic & thyme) in the broth, the flavors stood out and the taste was a lot bolder than others I have had with a lot more ingredients. The house-made fries were scrumptious. These are the best kind.\n\nEven with all that food, we still made room for dessert. We first had the Bread Pudding which was delicious but quite sweet. I am also not a fan of over sauced foods.\n\nOne wasn't enough so we also ordered the Bourbon Vanilla Bean Creme Brulee. It was superb and not too sweet which is a plus for me. The little cookies on top added nothing to the dessert and if anything could have been left off.\n\nAll that good food, I still have to give props to our server. He was amazing and engaging. The front desk soured the mood a little bit a first but he more than made up for it. I couldn't have asked for anyone better.",

    "text": "Excellent food and bar. Slow service.\n\nA friend and I stopped here during an evening of bar hopping in the CBD. We were seated promptly and given our menus, which are half-French, half-English. Not a big deal for anyone who can read French and/or has been living in Louisiana for a reasonable amount of time, but definitely something tourists should be wary of. I didn't have any alcohol because I was the designated driver, but I can say that their drink menu is extensive, and the bar was packed from the moment we arrived until the moment we left. \n\nThis restaurant's biggest strength is it's food. I tasted their crab bisque, and had Poulet Grand-M\u00e8re as my entr\u00e9e. Both were excellent. The latter arrived in a wide cast-iron bowl, which I'm sure has a more proper name, but was an interesting touch nonetheless.\n\nThe service was why I gave this restaurant 4/5 instead of 5/5. Most of the wait staff seemed to be interns from culinary school. The handful we dealt with were very friendly, but would do well to be a little more attentive. For example, the server who brought us our desserts ran off before we could ask for spoons to eat the dessert with. \n\nIn summary, a good dining experience, but I think I would rather continue exploring new restaurants in the area before returning.",

    "text": "Came here for Sunday brunch and walked away with a very full belly and a good buzz! \n\nTheir brunch buffet includes tons of seafood, an omelet station, pasta bar, carving station, custom sushi rolls, fresh fruit, salads, and the usually breakfast foods you'd expect at a buffet. I almost forgot dessert...an entire side of the room is dedicated to a table full of desserts AND a chocolate fountain. The brunch price also include bottomless mimosas which were literally bottomless. Our server never let us empty our glasses and  the mimosas were very heavy on the champagne, so we all got a bit tipsy. At least the alcohol let us forget how much weight we gained during this meal.\n\nAs if the buffet spread wasn't enough, they also have an a la carte menu with small dishes. The choices included Belgian waffles, french toast, blintzes, Mahi, and a few other savory dishes.  You can order as many of these items as you want, as many times as you want. Our server was sure to remind us of this, she seemed to enjoy watching how gluttonous our table was! \n\nUnfortunately we were here during Tropical Storm Debby, so we didn't get to enjoy a beautiful view of the bay, Although, being here while the weather was so awful was very cozy with the fireplace and wood interior. Thanks to the weather it wasn't crowded either, so don't write this place off on account of bad weather. \n\nAt $35 a person, the Sunday brunch seems pricey, but if you have no qualms about overeating and overdrinking, you'll definitely get your money's worth.",

What we found was a busy place that actually knew how to operate with a full house. Our need were quickly satisfied with courteous and reasonably priced service. \n\nSince we were just two, we were quickly seated. We started off with a couple Highland stouts. It was a nice drink and at a reasonable price. Before our entree, we shared a large garden salad. It was fresh and flavorful. The dressing was a bit on the heavy side for a vinaigrette. \n\nFor entrees, I had the Black and Blue burger with fries. The burger was just incredible. It was perfectly cooked. The blue cheese was not overpowering. The bun was soft and fresh. The side of regular fries were crisp and lightly salted. Even better, they went perfectly with the homemade ketchup. I'm not a fan of ketchup, but theirs is very nice since they seem to avoid adding too much sweetness. My son had a basic burger with sweet potato fries. I tried the sweet potato fries and think they might be some of the best I've ever eaten. The burger looked as good as mine and my son concurred. \n\nThe burger was well made and consumed within minutes. No words were spoken as we ate. Always a good sign. We shall return.",

I've never seen anyone get so excited about food and discuss the ingredients in such detail with so much passion.  The food really was different and had unbelievable flavor.  Anyone who calls themselves a foodie should try this place.  I'm thinking they would be pleased with this place.  But, the portions were small.  And I really didn't like the interior of the restaurant.  I'm more of a booths girl.  Booths can be classy, you know?  All in all, I would say this was an interesting place and I would come back, but the dishes were too complicated for me to want to come back beyond once a year.  Speaking of timing, the chefs change the menu every year.  And these guys really are good at what they do.  The owners actually own the Red Pony and two other restaurants all on the same street!

The strawberry orange juice was excellent so I recommend trying it. It was a little hot in the restaurant, could have been cooled down a lot for a more comfortable experience.

    "text": "This is a great late brunch option during the weekends when the big morning rush dies down after 1 pm. Usually there is no wait or 5 minute wait at this time. One big complaint is that they don't have an organized system for seating guests. The servers don't always greet incoming patrons (which should be required Waffle House-style) and they sometimes tell you to seat yourself (which can lead to one or two people taking up tables for 4) or they'll seat you (whenever they get around to talking to you). \n\nI've ordered a several different dishes at this point and they have varies from ok to awesome. The chicken wings and onion rings are just ok. The wings are either lightly dredged in flour or not at and then fried whole. They aren't really seasoned so the wings are pretty bland. The \"onion rings\" made of formed, chopped onions that are breaded. The chicken fingers were a bit over battered and dry. The smashwich (or whatever it's called) was pretty good: your choice of breakfast meat with hash browns and eggs in a hoagie roll, but unspectacular. The club sandwich is classic diner fare that is very well executed. The egg and omelette platters are a very good deal and dang tasty. The best thing on the menu is definitely the waffle. It's gently sweet, very crispy and covered in butter. So good!\n\nThe service is generally pretty attentive (once you're seated), the restaurant and bathrooms are very clean, the food is a good, tasty value",

I've been here a couple of times, but they were the ones that wanted to go, due to their lunch special. It's a nice, well know restaurant that offers a 17.00 lunch special that includes a soup or salad, entree, and the option for a 4.00 Bloody Mary or martini. I got the Bloody Mary and it was a great size for the price. It was spicy and hit the spot.\nThey text message you when your table is ready, so were able to walk around the quarter while we waited. Thank god a lot of restaurants are getting rid of the those buzzers that make you feel like you are under house arrest. \nWe sat down to a beautiful table right by the open shutters. The servers, were ok. They were busy, but forgot a couple of things we asked for. It was still a great experience though!\nI got the pork chop with red beans and the turtle soup. The turtle soup was one of the best I have had. The pork chop was cooked to perfection and the read beans were seasoned very well. It came with cornbread, but it was very dry. After this lunch at noon, I didn't find myself hungry till it was basically time for bed. It was a very generous portion and well worth the money.\n\nMuriel's is a great way to get a classic, good quality New Orleans meal at a decent price. The location is spectacular, and the history behind the restaurant made for great conversation at the table.\nDefinitely check it out if you are in the Quarter!",

    "text": "It is typical Broad Ripple charming spot. Small, trendy and bustling with activity. They do not take reservations. Which is somewhat annoying when you are traveling from another part of town. Whatever, we just had to arrange to arrive earlier than we would have liked to hopefully secure a table, which we did. When we arrived it was quiet and only several tables had guests seated. As our dinner progressed it became more crowded until every seat was filled. Nice lively scene except then you can not hear squat! It made dinner conversation difficult. Boo!!!! I think this could be an easy fix for them. \n\nMeal/Drinks:  The cocktails were creative and tasted wonderful. Our servers suggestions were pretty spot on as we enjoyed most of her suggestions. \n\nThe guacamole was very good with the exception of the fact that my friend has a nut allergy and we asked to have them left off and of coarse they arrived with them on! They really weren't necessary in my opinion either as I don't think they add much to the dish. The reason I wanted to try this restaurant- The Harvest salad! We all split this as well and it was good. The combination of fruit and root vegetables was delish! The figs were so good and the herbed goat cheese mouse was a highlight on this plate!\n\nTwo of us ordered the Veracruz Trigger fish and the other ordered the Serrano Scallops and all of it was wonderful. The white sweet mashed potatoes were interesting! I am glad we tried them. The Veracruz sauce was wonderful and full of flavor. It was a lot of food though. Had we known we would have probably skipped one of the first course selections or split an entree. That'a ok though- lunch for today :)\n\nWe also tried the Tostones and Stewed Black Beans. Beans were very good, full of flavor! Tostones seemed very dry but maybe that is what they are supposed to be- this is the first time I have had them. BUT, dipped in the Stewed Black Beans they tasted great!\n\nWe passed on dessert as they had no gluten free, dairy free options. Delicia offers many options for restricted diets, which we loved. Just no dessert, which is probably better anyway-we were so full! \n\nGo, you will not be disappointed. Just go before 7pm on a Friday night to ensure a table.",

I applaud the change in style with the change in times. Too many places get stuck doing the same thing over and over again. I am glad to see that the food is still delicious. The Chicken Parm, Eggplant Parm, house salad and Alfredo are some of my favorites and they have great pizza. The alfredo sauce is made to order and taste amazing with their breadsticks. Some appetizer items leave something to be desired like the frozen cheesesticks or calimari. I would love to see these replaced with better quality items. Overall, I still love this place and would choose it over Olive Garden any day. I do miss the homey old school vibe from the old location but I also miss the good old days when people talked to each other, fragglerock ruled and hip hop was Wu Tang Clan. Oh well....",

They are nice people and corrected my order but instead of simply picking up my food I had to wait 20 minutes To get my original order. When all was said and done, the food was good.\n\nI was nearby and decided to give them a second chance. This time I ordered a pizza steak and I was really impressed! I need to have a couple more before I can declare them my new favorite pizza steak. Plenty of mozzarella cheese and the roll is stuffed with meat and just enough sauce. It's looking like this place is a lot better than my first impression.",

Half price beer during a generous happy hour, a huge deck that welcomes dogs, and delicious key lime pie.   Sadly, said deck allows smoking, and there is usually lots of it. I wish they at least had a nonsmoking side. \n\nIf giving a review just based on the food, I would give it a two. The pretzels are ok, but the cheese dip is Velveeta nastiest. As a native Wisconsinite, I take offense at plastic cheese. Then, there's the pretzel bun sandwiches. I've sampled the chicken, brat and Italian sausage. It's pricey, considering it comes with potato chips (seriously guys?! Get a fryer!) and just ok. The buns were kind of soggy and the overall experience underwhelming, especially knowing the epic sandwiches for sale next door. I wish the Village pub would focus on what it's best that, serving beer, and let us bring Mitchell's sandwiches over.",

    "text": "I finally made it to Farmhaus last Saturday, and it was worth the wait.  \n\nAs expected for a weekend, it was crowded.  We arrived about 15 minutes early and had to wait on the bench back by the bathrooms for a few minutes.  However, as I said, we were earlier than they anticipated, and they got us to the bar as soon as seats opened up.  They wisely gave us a copy of the menu to be prepared once we were seated, and we did indeed plan our entire meal in advance.  This was helpful, because we were actually seated about 20 minutes late, and I was about to eat the menu itself as I drooled over the descriptions!  \n\nThe smoked fish dip and escolar with prawns were fantastic- the standouts of the meal.  The mushroom salad and tapenade were also very good.  The meatloaf was good, but a little on the dry and bland side.  I wanted to get the nachos, but there were no other takers in my group....next time....\n\nService was good.  It was a bit shaky at times, but it was slammed the whole time we were there and that small space must be tough to work in.  \n\nI would love to go back and check out their blue place special lunches...I have heard amazing reviews.  I think I will head back for dinner when there is outdoor seating, as I think that would add to the experience.",

Jazz music was playing and I felt at home. \n\nFirst of all, I could not have been more grateful for the fresh loaf of bread we were given. We devoured it in a matter of minutes. Then came the gumbo ya-ya. It was spicy and savory and everything I expected from a gumbo. Finally came the bbq shrimp. We had been warned that these shrimp did come with their heads and tails on. Bibs were placed around our necks and we were off. The shrimp were some of the most rich and delicious ones I have ever tasted. The sauce they were served with was divine. Although it was messy, there is no other dish on the menu I would have traded for this.\n\nOverall, service was friendly and quick at Mr. B's. The food was delicious, although a little pricey.

    "text": "3.50 stars.  \n\nGabby's wasn't open.  I knew that.  Neither was Rotier's.  But my handy Yelp app had assured me that Fido's was open.  Imagine the disappointment when I realized there was a very real possibility that no burgers would happen on this trip down to the Deep South.  Would I really have to wait two more weeks when I would find solace in East Texas?   \n\n\"We can try Burger up,\" I mentioned.  \n\n\"Why don't you just call them?\" hissed the appropriately nicknamed Viper.  \n\nTrue.  We didn't have to keep driving around aimlessly.  So I call Burger Up, and a very pleasant, sweet voice assures me they are indeed open.  \n\nViper: \"What was her name?  She sounded hot.\"\n  \nMe: \"Paige.\"\n\nViper: \"Yeah, she's definitely hot.  Have you ever met an unattractive Paige?\"\n\nMe: \"Good point.  At least we have that going for us.\"\n\nPaige was indeed attractive, but this review isn't about a photogenic individual who happens to work at Burger Up.  It's about what ended up being a visit to our fourth choice for burgers in Nashville.  \n\nBurger Up follows a national trend towards upscale burgers.  My particular order consisted of a medium rare patty served with aged cheddar, Benton's bacon (very good), and ketchup served on an artisan bun.  Basically, it was a gussied up bacon cheeseburger, but it was a rather tasty one.  My major complaint is that I wish the actual meat itself exhibited more flavor.  Having said that, the burger was cooked properly and the flavors worked well together.  I ordered some wilted spinach on the side (mediocre) and truffle fries.  Let's talk about those truffle fries for a bit.  I know more people are apparently into the sweet potato fries here, but I think they are missing the boat.  Burger Up's truffle tries have pleasant aroma, taste great, and are the perfect texture for soaking up oil.  If you are on a diet, it is true you should skip these delightful fries.  But if that were the case, why are you at a burger joint in the first place?  Seriously, if you get nothing else out of my review, please do yourself a favor and order the truffle fries.  \n\nBurger Up also boast an interesting beer menu with semi-obscure breweries from the Deep South included in the list.  I tried a pecan-infused amber from Mississippi - not bad.  I could imagine Burger Up could be a decent place to drink for a bit after eating.  \n\nIf I attended Vanderbilt, I would probably go here on a moderately frequent basis.  If you want a change from the dive bar hamburger, Burger Up is a decent change of pace.",

I do believe they use flash-frozen sashimi grade fish, but the color, texture, taste and smell are perfect.  Easily the best spicy tuna I have ever had.  I think the secret is the kewpie mayo along w/ the right amount of sriracha and sichimi powder.  Frankly, I can't get enough of this place and have at times, eaten it every day for lunch for weeks.  I've gone as far as to pick it up for dinner AFTER having had it for lunch. Their introduction of short-grain brown sushi rice has been great!\n\nThe Sushiman, YC Park is amazing to watch.  I've seen him skin a cucumber with a sword-like sushi knife in no time flat, in a single ribbon and then continue to shave it into a nori thin sheet for his tuna naruto roll roll.  The temaki are as big as a carnival iced cream cone.  You can barely finish one of them, there is so much fish in there.  The nigiri are beautiful.  Uniform pieces of fresh fish, perfectly perched on the best sushi rice I've ever had (just the right amount of vinegar and sugar).\n\nSkip the newly opened Kooma.  Save Mikimotos for a night out, but go to Tokyo for lunch!  The owners are lovely, so support them in this tough economy.  If you must eat sushi, eat it here!\n\nWhy not 5 stars?  I have to save it for places that serve the local fresh fish, plucked out of the water that morning.  Let me know if you find a place that does!",

Since Friendly's closed a few years ago, Warminster has sorely needed a new ice cream place (DQ was our last one standing for quite some time). \n\nMuch to my dismay, the Big Scoop had already closed for the season. I marked it in my calendar go return in March, when it reopened. Upon my next trip home in the spring, I was disappointed to see that I was just a few days early for their reopening, and would have to wait until my return in April.\n\nAfter much anticipation, I made it to Big Scoop last weekend with my sister (who has been before). I was shocked to see what a range of products they serve - hot dogs, funnel cake, onion rings, pizza, you name it! I was tempted at the prospect of waffles and ice cream, but I wasn't that hungry so I settled for a scoop of chocolate chip cookie with hot fudge and whipped cream. The generous scoop of ice cream was tasty and packed with globs of cookie dough! I also tasted the birthday cake, which I enjoyed very much. \n\nThe service was quick, and the shop crowded quickly. The interior was nicely remodeled and looks clean and family friendly. The man who helped me was extremely courteous and seemed to be doing most of the work. \n\nEspecially given the lack of competition around here, the Big Scoop gets an easy four stars!",

This may wind up being one of my more regular haunts as I slog my way through more of their menu (I think I may need to heavily modify next time I'm there), but so far, I have no cause at all for complaint and much to celebrate. It's interesting to me that the environments of the various locations are different, sometimes vastly, yet all have their own unique and innate charm. Whoever is running these is doing a phenomenal job, so props there.\n\nOne thing of note here...the ordering system is extremely clunky and seemingly disorganized and I sort of dislike it. Not enough to stop coming here, since I really dig the vibe of these, but on one of my less patient nights, that sort of thing may be enough to cut this out of the running.

They also have a pool table and darts in the back which we played while waiting for bingo to start.\n\nWe will definitely be back!",

The bartender was a bit slow at first but kept us well tended. \nOur table in the corner against the glass was ready early and we enjoyed watching the rays chase fish around the bay as the sun set.  \nI started with the tasty crab and corn chowder but was a bit disappointed with al dente potatoes in the bowl. \nWife ordered the scallops which were superb as was my crab stuffed grouper. But my rice was also inadequately cooked. \nCreve br\u00fbl\u00e9e was excellent as was Tim's attentive service. \nWorth going again, but they need to get all the parts of the dishes correct to get 5 stars.",

From  the  70s vintage floral upholstery  to the back entrance off the alley, it undersells it self and sets you up for a great surprise.  The food is good -- not fancy, not at all pretentious - but good. \n\nA group from work made the trek on the coldest day of the year and we were rewarded for our efforts -- the chicken hot pot was the best example this dish I have ever had.  The seafood dish with shrimp, scallops and squid was very generous for the price of about $10. The beef in black bean sauce was nice and spicy.  \n\nI will certainly return, but only with adventurous companions.",

    "text": "FOOD REVIEW\n\nIf you're looking for quality meal that is quick and affordable, the Fountain has you covered. The menu isn't extensive, but it's got a good amount of inexpensive sandwiches, salads, and soups.  \n\nTheir Cuban Sandwich ($10 w/ side) was pretty excellent.  The bread wasn't the traditional panini-style, but a French baguette...it was still great and had a little crispness to it.  All the main ingredients (meat, mustard, pickles, cheese) were in good balance.  As a Florida boy who loves his Cuban sandwiches, I would definitely recommend this.\n\nI also tried a bit of their Royal Grille, a grilled-chese sandwich with several cheeses, as well as apple slices, on whole grain wheat bread ($8.50 w/ side, extra to add ham/turkey).  It was damn good and hit the grilled cheese craving just right.  A side salad was also done well.\n\nFor my side, I chose their \"spicy carrots\" which sounded unique.  It consists of sliced raw carrots that have been marinated in a tangy dressing with crushed red pepper, served in a cup. The carrots were cold and crisp and the flavors were fantastic.  The spice was just enough to be pleasant.  I would definitely get these again.\n\nOur food came out super quick and our service was great.  I'm looking forward to trying a couple more items and bumping this up to 5 stars.",

It was warm and fragrant and with all the condements they bring on the side, easy to customize. We also got BBQ pork sandwiches and they were very tasty. The meat was tender and flavorful and they had fresh herbs on them and some kind of yummy sauce. They only take cash, so make sure you hit the ATM before you go.

The place is open 24/7\nThe ATMS are no surcharge (yes!!!)\nThey place really, really cool music!\n\n(OK, so I just glanced over at Simon E.'s review of this same WaWa and he says the vibe is upbeat, and that is def. true!  Friendly staff who seem happy to work there!  And getting a wave in the ALWAYS packed parking lot is indeed a common occurrence.)\n\nGripes:  Parking.  I never even try to park in the front lot anymore.  I either walk to WaWa, or if I am driving, I park in the back lot.  Yes, WaWa has a second lot, behind the store.  Almost always an open spot.  Often times, there is 5-10 open spots back there.  \n\nGripes continued:  Often there are panhandlers.  Not really WaWa's fault, I mean we are talking Germantown Ave, in Philadelphia proper, it is a reality.  There have not been any aggressive panhandlers since 2014, so this is not a concern really any longer.\n\nMajor points for:  \n*seasonal specialties!  I look forward to autumn for the pumpkin cannoli dip and chips!  I also dig the apple cider donuts and to a lesser degree the pumpkin donuts.  \n*Prices!  Everything is reasonable!  Some stuff is cheap!\n*Selection!  Good choice for candy, chips, snacks, healthy snacks/protein bars, drinks, etc.\n*For the MASSIVE VOLUME that the store does, the lines usually move very fast and efficiently, and 2nd registers open up lightning fast when they are needed!\n*The store is clean from my point of view.  It is a busy, busy store, but I never see any mess on the floor or coffee station or food station.\n\nI do not eat any of the hot food.  Low quality, I steer clear.  \n\n\nFor a convenience store that is open 24 hours, WaWa is awesome!  \n\nDoes this one have a bathroom?  I never used it, I never checked....but maybe there is no bathroom for customers there!  Maybe it is around back?  Hmmm.  I would avoid using it anyway.  \nAlso, this WaWa could never have gas pumps, traffic is already congested between Allens Lane and Mt. Airy Avenue along Germantown Ave.  (Between WaWa and the Bank of America on the corner.)\nOverall:  This place is awesome based on the music selection and friendly staff working 24/7.  This store does a lot right!",

There are a few dishes I dream about and this is one of them.      We also tried the fried calamari; it was good.    I'm from the north where we like marinara sauce with calamari.   In the south it seems to be served with sweeter soy or  sweet chili based sauces which I'm still getting used to.    Our entrees were very good: po-boy and fish of the day.

On a weekday, it is good for lunch or dinner with friends or the hubby.  I recommend the Luke burger (even though I believe it is sacrilegious to order a burger at an establishment such as this, however this is THE exception!) The flamenkutche is really good, too.  It is like a German pizza.  I also enjoy the cochondelait poboy, shrimp & grits, and croque madame , which are excellent.  We are never disappointed and always enjoy the ambiance of the old style New Orleans  restaurant.",

It was probably the most delicious lasagna i have had other than my mothers, obviously.

    "text": "We had a reservation and were seated immediately upon arrival. The menu consists of small plates, so really nice for sampling a number of different items on the menu. We tried the sliders, fish tacos, fries and mac&cheese, all of which were pretty good. There was a lovely duo playing during our dinner and it was nice that we were able to enjoy the music and still have a conversation. \nA few tips if you have never been here before:\n- Make sure you have a reservation or be subject to dine/stand at the bar.\n- Even with a reservation, you are instructed to complete your dining within 90 minutes of being seated. Understandable. \n- Try everything!",

    "text": "I visited the Gaylord Opryland hotel/resort/conglomerate a few weeks ago when I was visiting Nashville with my boyfriend. We stopped by to see the hotel, but didn't stay there as guests. This place wasn't really near any downtown things, but we rented a car so it was no big deal to get there. (If you're flying in for a weekend, I really recommend renting a car- I have no idea how we would have gotten around otherwise.) \n\nParking was outrageously expensive so we parked in some shopping center across the street and walked in. It was maybe a 10 minute walk, but you're mostly walking through nicely manicured Opryland foliage so it's a nice walk.\n\nThe hotel was a sight to behold- HUGE glass ceilings, indoor river, many, many restaurants inside which had an \"outdoor\" feel because of the massive atrium. We took a boat ride given by \"Delta River Boat Tours\" which was a cute little boat on a track in their indoor river with a sweet southern tour guide letting us in on all the \"fascinating\" facts about the hotel. She told everything as if it was the most amazing fact that had ever left her lips: \"Here we have the original interior wall of the hotel... it was built in NINETEEN SEVENTY SEVEN!\" (So old!) or, our favorite, \"Here in the hotel we have an INDOOR SWIMMING POOL, so that you can swim ALL YEAR ROUND\" (You mean, INSIDE the building? Impossible!) \n\nAnyway, it was hilarious. Seems like a nice place just to see/have a drink/ maybe dinner if prices aren't insane. Extra star for our tour guide who we still laugh about.",

In fact, it's really the only Chinese restraunt in the area that gets filled up with the majority of Chinese patron's on any given night.  Bottom line is Chinese people go where the food is good, so hopefully this place will continue to serve good food to keep us coming.  Szechuan food is spicy, so beware.  Each time we go, we order the Happy Fish in Spicy Soup.  The soft shell crab is another one we've tried.  The tea duck is great.  Anyone can definitely gravitate to the typical americanized Chinese food, but ask the server for the authentic Szechuan style.  I'm giving this place 1 less star becaue we've experienced a mix of servers where some are more patient and courteous than others.\n\nOn the final note, we've frequented this restaurant about once a month, but we've never had the problems with flies like some of the other reviewers.",

    "text": "This place was recommended to me by one of the hotel staff. What he described the place to be was spot on.\n\nIt is very eclectic with random decor and music.\n\nThe bartender was on point and the rest of the staff seemed friendly enough.\n\nI ordered the Big Jerk sandwich and the Caprese, but asked to have that as a salad instead of a sandwich, which they had no problem doing. Both were good with the Caprese stealing the show.\n\nThe food:\nThe Big Jerk was flavorful and the meat was very tender (pork). It was a little on the dry side even tho it came with a dipping sauce. The caramelized onions were a little on the sweet side. The pickle spear that came with it was not your standard \"dill spear\". It is homemade and very fresh, just lacking a little zest, but still good.\nThe caprese rocked. The balsamic reduction, cubes of Moz, diced tomatoes and sunflower seeds was a winning combination. I will definitely get that again but next time I will ask them to scale back on the size. Way more than I needed.\n\nNow for the good stuff: The house beer, \"Phat Beer\". I'm not big on IPA's or local brews, but this one has won my heart. Somewhere twixt a Bud and Bud Light but with a lot more flavor and a little pinch on your tongue.\n\nThe only reason Phat's didn't get five stars was because of the Big Jerk. They need to freshen that up a little.\n\nFootnote:\nPhat's needs to upgrade/separate the restrooms. The women should not have to deal with what the men leave behind. They also need to upkeep it on a more regular basis.\nThey also definitely need to get an exhaust hood over the griddle.",

    "text": "I'd heard the hype. Seen the NY Times article. Nevertheless I was skeptical. Mainly because most people have at best, two reference points for donuts, Dunkin Donuts or Krispy Kreme. Neither of which really makes truly great donuts.  So after waiting for the crowds to die down a little, I traveled over to see for myself last Saturday.\n\nIt's a small shop that blends into the surrounding neighborhood. Inside there are a couple of seats at the counter and a wide window well that two people could sit in. I ordered my donuts. I went with the Indian Cinnamon, the caramel banana, the pina colada, and the halva pistachio. The ladies behind the counter worked as fast as they could given the decent sized collection of people waiting for orders and bopping in. My order was processed quickly, and I got my coffee right after I ordered it. The coffee was one of the only things that was a disappointment besides the lack of seating.\n\n Since there was no room to sit, much less stand I took my donuts and coffee out to a park just off of Federal between 3rd and 4th St.\nThe donuts were truly transcendant.  Each donut was a symphony of flavors on my tongue.\n\nThe Indian Cinnamon-Very light on the cinnamon, coated with sugar. Hot, fresh, and so moist that it pinched in half when I started to eat it.\n\nThe caramel banana-A delicious meld of flavors with something added to the banana chips that made them more tasty than I\"d imagined.\n\nThe pina colada-The donut I though I'd enjoy the least. However it tasted like the Rach 3 and Beethoven's 9th all rolled up. A complex mix of flavors that together was truly amazing. And unlike the current generations, I don't use that term lightly.\n\nThe halva and pistachio-the final movement. More subtle flavors that nevertheless worked well. I'd never had halva before, but I liked it.\n\nBelieve the hype. Believe the NY Times article. Federal Donuts makes some of the best donuts I've had.",

We did skip salads, but hubby enjoyed the wonderful lobster bisque, of which I found exceptionally good, with my one snitched spoonfull. \n\nMy husband had the Prime Rib, what else? I love filet mignon and they have in house made bearnaise sauce, so I stuck with what I love best and it was a huge, juicy and tender portion, very good indeed. \n\nThe restaurant has a lot of class and prices are what you would expect. \n\nWhat I loved most about the service, for such an upscale establishment, the wait staff was not at all uptight.

    "text": "I frequent the Rittenhouse Square area often as an old friend runs a bar down the street, and have passed Porcini's many times. Having had a date last Saturday, I thought it would have been a good opportunity to try it out. \nThe layout of the restaurant left some to be desired, as the host stand is at the back, and the place is very small save for the upstairs, but they were able to sit us almost immediately in the upstairs dining room which was small, yet charming, and slightly more roomy. A gentleman who I am guessing was the co-owner was very friendly and ensured our 8:00 reservation was filled and the wine poured. The service wasn't slow, though awkward. It seemed that our server was there when we didn't need her, yet not there when we did, though she had a very friendly demeanor and was not rushing us in the least.\nThe food was delicious, though a few things stood out to me as peculiar, hence the 4 stars instead of 5. This was a legit Italian restaurant, yet they had ravioli as an antipasto. Anybody who knows Italian knows this means \"before\" the pasta, not the pasta itself. Secondly, the bread, which was very good, came with butter, and not Olive Oil. Again, this was an Italian restaurant, not an Applebee's. \nFor our appetizer we ordered eggplant, which was okay. Was sliced a bit too thin, though this may have been personal preference, but in doing so was masked by the (delicious) red gravy and (addictive) mozzarella, which was very fresh, so while I may not have been tasting the eggplant, I was tasting some very delicious flavors. \nOur main courses came in due time afterwards, enough to let our eggplant digest, but not enough time to make us forget. I ordered the special, linguine in a light vodka cream sauce with salmon and capers, my date ordered the canneloni. Both were inspired. Not the gigantic portions known to most frequent Italian restaurant goers in Philadelphia, but just enough. The flavors were subtle, yet plentiful. \nWe did skip dessert in favor of coffee. I ordered a double espresso, my date a cappucino (I know, but she was cute, so it's okay). The waittress came out with a regular and double cappucino. Wasn't the end of the world, so I just enjoyed it, and it was good, but just speak up if you want an espresso. \nOverall I recommend this place, mainly for the main courses, but am willing to go back and give it another shot and give Porcini's their 5th star. I hope I can!",

I wasn't blown away with the lunch options but I would recommend this place for breakfast to my friends and family. Their quality is WAY better than Dunkin Donuts sandwiches. However, the man and woman behind the counter are very rude and it's a shame becuase the owner seems like such a nice man. They have ignored customers standing in a long line to hold conversations and move extremely slow as if no one has anywhere to go. Don't bother calling an order ahead becuase chances are they won't answer the phone during breakfast hours.",

Decently priced. Not the best location - but there is street parking around. \n\nIt can be hard to find a table because it is very popular but the wine list was pretty extensive so everyone will find something they like. Each glass is around $8-$12. Good cocktails as well if you're not feeling wine. They have a kitchen as well where you can order food but I didn't eat any so can't speak to it. \n\nVery chill place to hang out and enjoy some good wine and good music. :)",

    "text": "I've been waiting for what seems like ages for Lee House's latest restaurant to open up shop. Seriously, it's been in limbo since the spring time. What took so long? I guess, as the saying goes, you have to wait for the good things in life.\n\nAnyways, we had a little reunion with one of my buddies from out of town and went to check out Lee House's latest digs. The place was pretty packed for a Wednesday evening and is split into two different areas, the left side more compact with smaller tables while the right side is for bigger groups of families and friends. The restaurant has a very spacious, open air feeling and they clearly put a lot of time and effort into making things look great. I was hoping that they would put more of their focus on Korean BBQ, as Edmonton is seriously lacking a good place. We shall see, I'm sure things will change when they finish renovating their original Whyte Ave shop.\n\nWhile we were waiting for my buddy to show up, we perused the menu which has quite the variety of options. We decided to try several of their BBQ options but sadly, we didn't even get to grill any meat. Sad face. Also, I have to mention service was pretty weak, even for an Asian restaurant. We could barely hear when the waitress told us what our dishes were, had to ask for tea several times, and it was hard to flag down someone to take our order. I'm sure it will get better once they settle in.\n\nWe ordered:\n- Banchan and rice bowls - the banchan were all good, especially the bean sprouts and spinach. I just wish they brought out more/re-filled them during our meal.\n- Bibimbap ($10.95) - steamed rice topped with vegetables (carrots, spinach, zucchini, daikon, bean sprouts) over a lightly fried egg.  They brought out the Korean chili paste in a separate bottle, so you can add as much as you want. The bibimbap was decent but nothing to write home about. \n- Jap chae bokeum ($11.95) - potato noodles with mixed vegetables, black fungus mushroom in a sweet soy mushroom sauce. This dish was perfectly done! Noodles had the perfect chew. I think I just love noodles. Someone teach me how to make this at home.\n- Bulgogi ($14.95) - sliced beef marinated in a sweet soy garlic sesame sauce. \n- Spicy pork loin bulgogi ($14.95) - sliced pork loin marinated in a sweet onion, garlic chili paste. Slightly spicy, full of flavour, this was my favourite bulgogi dish of the night.\n- Sweet ginger pork bulgogi ($14.95) - sliced pork loin marinated in a sweet ginger sesame soy. I didn't get too much ginger flavour from this one, but it was still quite tasty.\n\nSo to sum up, first visit (of what I'm sure will be many) was pretty good. Lots of interesting items to lure you back. We'll have to make sure next time we try out their other BBQ items and do some grilling! I'm impressed with all the good Korean restaurants in town - make sure to add this one to your list of must try.",

I was told by a girl that cut my hair that they have the best gluten-free bread and buns she has ever tasted. She said they were so good, that she ate six buns in a row. I was excited, when I heard this, because Kinnikinnick's bread is not very good. It's like eating bricks, and it took me years to get used to it; not to mention, it only really tastes good when it's toasted. \n\nI've tried Breadland's arrowroot gluten-free buns. These are indeed very good. They are very soft and the outside is chewy, and they taste great with just about anything: butter, hummus, melted cheese, or peanut butter & jam. The only problem is that I can't eat them, because they give me really bad eczema on my face. I suspect it's all the yeast they put in it. The focaccia gluten-free bread they sell is also really good. This is like a thick flat bread that is flavoured with tons of herbs and I think some garlic too. It's so good, and although it contains yeast, I don't get eczema, so it must not be that much. \n\nThese breads are very expensive though, so I only get them as a treat.",

    "text": "Have gone to this location several times and am always impressed. The staff is always super polite and welcoming even when it is a busy weekday lunch hour. They even offer samples if you're having trouble deciding. The bakery area is always well stocked. Some favorites of Panera in general include: black bean soup, vegetable soup with pesto, Asian chicken salad, Thai chicken salad, tuna salad sandwich, Cuban panini, Napa almond chicken salad sandwich. I recently tried a soba noodle bowl with chicken and it was yummy. Perfect size with a side of baguette. And I absolutely love the strawberry poppyseed chicken salad. Wish it was around all year!! Losing one star because it is always freezing in here despite the time of year. Not a comfortable eating atmosphere.",

    "text": "Went to lunch today with some fella's.  we all got the Wednesday specials- I got the shrimp \u00e9touff\u00e9e with a side salad. The \u00e9touff\u00e9e was a good size portion the meal was delicious(9.99 can't beat that and if you can you can beat the mission of the cafe) The other two tried the pot roast with the two sides both were happy! For dessert we split a bread pudding THE best in the city. Great visit as always and the renovation are wonderful. Have been going to cafe reconcile for 5 years now and always walk out happy!",

    "text": "Delicious sandwiches, great pizzas, decent sides, all made with fresh, flavorful ingredients. Their toasted subs are the best, and the pizza sauce is among the best around. Really, my only complaint is the lack of a whole grain bread. Try the traditional grinder, or the tuna sandwich.",

    "text": "Mead -- I always thought of it as some old timey drink.  Boy, did New Day blow my mind with all that they have to offer!\n\nHoney wines, mead, ciders, and even mixed cocktail concoctions.  \n\nI highly recommend starting with a tasting menu so that you can try several different drinks and then settle in a pint of your favorite.  This place looks small, but if you see that door near the back -- head down the hallway to another seating area that is basically the same size as out front.\n\nI also enjoy that New Day supports many local charities and events.  And they sell local honey and other artisan goods.  A great stop when hopping around Fountain Square!",
