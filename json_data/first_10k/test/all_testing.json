I called ahead, (90 minutes prior) and arrived and was told it would take an hour to be seated. I was a bit confused and asked why so long, and the hostess said the call ahead didn't really matter, it takes into affect when I arrive....that made absolutely no sense. I left. I have been here before and the food was okay, not the best and two wait an extra hour after my call ahead and getting the response from the host was unacceptable.",

The waitress was very nice and really understood the menu. The salad and pizza were awesome. The portions were large and the price was reasonable.  I knew it was family owned so you never know what to expect. Sometimes family owned is like going to someone's house and eating in their kitchen. The negatives? The draft beer tappers were broken and not fixed because too expensive according to staff. The toilet was leaking in the rest room. They had a bucket under it that only caught half the water leading to about an inch of standing water on the floor. We were the only people there for the hour we visited. The staff of about 5-6 who all appeared to be family hung out in the front watching TV. My review. Incredible food at a good price with good service. I don't know why it's an empty restaurant on a Saturday evening. But like a family home/restaurant you take the chance of being a guest in their home that needs a little work and hanging out with family members. That's what a family restaurant is. I'll be back.",

Charlie got a caesar salad, which was just some lettuce with cheese and croutons sprinkled on top. The lettuce was slimy and the croutons were soggy by the time they were brought to the table.

For its location and it being noon on a Thursday we were surprised to find there was literally only one table open when we walked in. Food is served pretty quick though so it didn't seem anyone was really waiting.  Based on reviews we had read, my hubby had the tri-tip sandwich. I ordered the buffalo burger. I have to say that was one of the best burgers I have ever had in my life. As usual, we traded tastes of our orders. My hubby was so jealous of my buffalo burger and I heard about it several more times throughout the day, that he should've got the burger. The tri-tip was quite dry, and it was literally just the meat on bread, big bread.  The horseradish sauce (served on the side) was very tasty though. For the tri-tip, I give a 3, hubby gives a 4. We both give the buffalo burger a definite 5++.  Either way, worth checking out if you want something with a unique atmosphere and that is away from town but not a long drive. Very peaceful.",

I also had a taste of their pear cider (which you can also get off tap) and the flavor mixed with the fizz was actually really good. Not the kind where it sort of hurts your throat. And with the ciders you won't feel the alcohol so much too so you wouldn't really know if you're starting to get tipsy or not.

    "text": "Okay, so, this is a pizza place.  Unless you're Italian, which I am.  Then this is something completely different.  Different in a good way, in my opinion, but very far off traditional Italian pizza.  The crust is whole wheat, and slightly sweet, and the toppings range from typical American to wild and wacky -- I'm looking at you marinated tempeh!  I like that Mellow lets you customize your own meal -- not just for pizza toppings, but also for salads.  The Build-Your-Own salad is a great idea that gives you endless opportunity for variety.   The salad size is AMPLE, the choice of toppings is exceptional, and the dressings are very good.  I also like that Mellow has something for everyone.  They have gluten-free crust available, and I hear they are working on vegan cheese, if they don't have it already.  Lest your meativore cohorts get nervous when they see vegan cheese, tofu and tempeh on the menu, assure them that they also have the full range of carnivore-approved toppings.  No one need go away hungry.  But I can't forget to mention the very best thing about Mellow -- their beer selection.  They take their beer VERY seriously at Mellow and provide their beer-loving customers with an ever-changing selection of artisan brews, both on tap and in bottles.  It's a very good place to explore what beer can be, although you should be warned, some selections are not for the beer-timid.  Their knowledgeable barman will be willing to help you make a selection that will please your sensibilities.  Which brings me to the main reason I didn't give dear old Mellow a 5-star review: if you fall in love with a beer here, drink up, because it will in all likelihood be gone the next time you visit.  Also, the selection changes faster than the printed menu, so they are often out of the first choice you make.  Nearly every visit sees my waitress going to bar and returning empty-handed when a beer listed on the menu is no longer in stock.  Sometimes more than once.  One time, it took me 4 tries to choose a brew that was still available.  It's a niggling complaint, but a little more consistency would be nice.",

I got the meat pies, which were just okay...they tasted like they came out of a frozen box, but like a nicer brand, as opposed to... for example, Hot Pockets. Ha! Nothing wonderful, nothing terrible.  The drink that the bartender made was solid though.   The second time we went there was a different bartender.  We were there on work, so we needed to stay within a certain budget with our food.  I ordered a slider (they have them as a single option) and a side of the brussel sprouts.  I specifically had pointed to the single slider on the menu when ordering.  When the food came out, it was the two slider meal option, and when I pointed it out (because of the work budget), it was just really awkward.  The bartender came out with an extra plate and proceeded to clear off the second burger and fries and take them in back... The slider was a better choice than the meat pies.  The brussel sprouts were good, but not great, a little greasy.  The environment is chill, relaxed, easy.  This place is not far from the convention center, so it's an easy walk after a long day there.

When my work declared happy hour at this location, how could I not resist beating rush hour traffic to order my favorite craft beers?  Now, I'm a fan of porters and stouts, so ML Rose never disappoints. This time, I ordered the Highland Black Mocha Stout from Asheville, NC which went down ever-so smoothly. It was quite frankly like drinking velvet. I've had the Japa Milk Chai stout in the past and was similarly thrilled. ML Rose is to beer as Nashville is to country music: it is the definitive marker of what beer goes. Period.  If you happen to be a huge fan of bar food, this location does not disappoint. I particularly appreciated the generous portion on my Carolina Sweets order. So, let me explain this magnificent paragon of culinary achievement: perfectly crunchy sweet potato waffle fries hugged by dollops of pulled pork, all smothered with a carolina mustard bbq and kissed by a few diced green onions. Talk about food that hits every tastebud high note: savory, sweet, sour, and (with a kick of hot sauce from your table) just a bit spicy. I suggest saving the entire plate for yourself because you will not be inclined to share. Trust me, this dish inspires selfishness in us all. While I have tried the Five Alarm Burger, I admit that what truly sticks out is the Caroline Sweets dish due to satisfaction alone. Bar none.  Because we did come in such a large party, I do believe the waitstaff struggled to handle the numbers. Beers were delivered late or could not be ordered due to busyness, orders were forgotten or delivered to the wrong people. Common mishaps considering the huge party that we made up. However, the quality of my food and beer were still spot on, despite my beer gazing at me from afar (for far too long).   I would suggest the Charlotte location if you are looking for a less busy location, but this one is fun since it has a lovely beer garden in the back. Eat, drink, be merry at M.L. Rose.

This place is truly a vegetarian/vegan haven, boasting an exciting and expansive menu geared towards this demographic. One major downfall is service, however.

I was excited, when I heard this, because Kinnikinnick's bread is not very good. It's like eating bricks, and it took me years to get used to it; not to mention, it only really tastes good when it's toasted.   I've tried Breadland's arrowroot gluten-free buns. These are indeed very good. They are very soft and the outside is chewy, and they taste great with just about anything: butter, hummus, melted cheese, or peanut butter & jam. The only problem is that I can't eat them, because they give me really bad eczema on my face. I suspect it's all the yeast they put in it. The focaccia gluten-free bread they sell is also really good. This is like a thick flat bread that is flavoured with tons of herbs and I think some garlic too. It's so good, and although it contains yeast, I don't get eczema, so it must not be that much.   These breads are very expensive though, so I only get them as a treat.",

We were seated and given menus promptly.    The place is nicely decorated, comfortable and clean.  Good start.    Our waiter seemed a by annoyed that it took us a bit to decide what to order although they weren't overly busy-no one waiting for a seat.  After getting coffee (waiter didn't offer creamer & there wasn't any on the table) my husband requested water and the waiter just looked at him.  He did bring it shortly, but I realized later that the hostess took water to another table so maybe that wasn't his job ??   Hubby ordered corned beef hash with eggs, I got the spinach cream cheese omelette w/fruit and ordered a side of hash browns, and our son ordered pancakes with chocolate chips and bacon.   My husband wasn't pleased with his corned beef.  It was grisly and not great.  Said he would rather have had canned.  He tried to use the pepper grinder but quickly decided it was too much work as he couldn't turn it without working really hard at it (although a nice touch to have one at each table of a restaurant).  My omelet didn't have much flavor, the hash browns had a \"wang\" to them, Hubby agreed and ketchup didn't cover the flavor even though I tried (they just tasted off -wondering if it was the oil they used or something) and the fruit I got wasn't cold and looked like they had mixed a new batch of fresh with old as some of the pineapple was great and some like it had sat for a few days- then with a couple of really fresh blackberries right on top.  My son ate his pancakes like a champ but the texture seemed weird to me.    Sadly we won't be back as the reviews looked great & the food actually looked great on the plate as well, but sadly missed the mark for us.  Seasonings and textures just weren't right even though everything was visually appealing.  The only thing that tasted good to me was the bite of pancakes I took of my son's meal because I got a chocolate chip= flavor.",

I watched her take the other two people's orders and make their crepes from a pile of already made crepes on the counter and not prepare them fresh as they are supposed to. She took my order and I asked for a fresh crepe made to order. She ignored me and made my crepe from her pile of previously made Crepes and I could see that she still had at least three more premade crepes yet to use. My crepe was soggy and a little gross. I watched her from the moment I stood in line till I left and she did not make one crepe for the three of us.  The next day I was at the mall to deposit a cheque so I went to the crepe works to let them know what happened the night before and get another one to take home. When I started to tell the guy what happened he cut me off and said I was wrong. He told me it was impossible and I did not see that. So I tell him that I know what I saw and it happened for three crepes not just mine. Again he tells me no I'm wrong they are not allowed to do that and so it was impossible. I told him that he was calling me a liar which is a bad thing to do to a customer and that I was there and he was not so I would know what happened. I tried logic as well explaining that the word impossible implies that there is no possible way for her to have done however anyone could make a bunch of crepes and pile them on top of each other. It's not even hard and in fact obviously she did it to cut corners and save time for herself.   For the next twenty mins he tells me that I have no idea what I am talking about, that its impossible to happen and that I'm wrong. He also has the audacity to say I'm just in a bad mood so I'm saying these things because of that. First of all this guy knows nothing about me and I was in a great mood before when I started to tell him about it I just wanted them to make sure it doesn't happen again. Now every time I come to get a crepe he asks me if I'm in a bad mood or not which makes me feel very uncomfortable. Plus when I told him that his customer service was horrible and NO ONE talks to a customer that way that wants to run a successful business he tells me the owner would treat me exactly the same way. He gave me a card supposedly with his bosses number on it but after I left a message explaining the whole thing I never heard back. That was over two weeks ago now.  I do mostly enjoy the crepes although they are NEVER made the way the example looks. It bothers me that every time I go buy one he asks me if I'm in a bad mood and makes fun of me.",

A mild taste for all backgrounds, but they were happy to bring out a side of pepper sauce for my dad who needed a kick. The owner Anthony was kind enough to greet us and explain the meaning behind the name of the restaurant. The peanut punch is a must have. The food was authentic and satisfied my Trinidadian mother!

    "text": "If you're adventurous in your food-tasting, I guess this would be the place to go. I came here during Mardi Gras weekend, and found it (after searching for 30 minutes) in one of the alleyways with very few people dining in. It seemed strange to me, as people on the streets were raging outside, why this restaurant was as deserted as it was. I soon found out the reason.  THE FOOD was definitely not my cup of tea. We were feeling adventurous and ordered the P\u00e2t\u00e9 of Louisiana rabbit & chicken livers and Pied de cochon \"croustillant\" off the Charcuterie section. NOT WHAT WE WERE EXPECTING. Apart from the fact that we did not speak French and had NO idea what we were ordering, the waiter made no attempt to help us despite our questioning gazes. When they arrived, the croustillant turned out to be two small pieces of deep-fried undistinguishable meat (or pig's feet meat, not that we could tell). We couldn't see where the Louisiana rabbit & chicken livers were, but on the other plate was a jar full of questionable jam. We soon found out the \"jam\" was actually the \"p\u00e2t\u00e9\" of the livers. Ech.  THE SERVICE was pretty absent (or should I say absentminded?). When we first entered the restaurant, the host was talking on the phone with her friend/SO, and even though we stood right in front of her, she kept on giggling to the person on the other end of the phone. It wasn't until a man with a managerial vibe stood behind her that she hung up the phone and showed us to our seats. Our waiter clearly was not really paying attention. He told us he would bring us water with lemons and straws, and it took him 30 minutes to bring just the water, without the lemons and straws (but I guess I must be too picky). When it was time to ring up the check, he brought us a check totaling $100. Um excuse me? No way two deep-fried balls and a jar of pate could cost $100. We had to wait for him to come around to ask him if it was the right check. So in total:  Time we spent waiting for service = 1-2 hours Time we spent eating = 10 minutes Get the picture?  THE ATMOSPHERE was pretty good. Dim lighting gave off a romantic kind of feel. The bookshelves were a nice touch. Made me want to grab a book and start reading it while waiting for service.",

Our waiter was very courteous and we felt very welcomed the instant we stepped into the restaurant.

They started with the hand washing and distribution of towels (yeah we were dressed all nicely which is fine, but keep in mind that your pants might get dirty). The cucumber and eggplant portion (it tasted like beef lol) was delicious, the chicken/egg plate was odd but we liked the flaky stuff as we all choked on the powdered sugar on top haha Then came the meats; we had the mild chicken with olives where, its true, the meat just fell right off the bones, and we had half of the beef kebabs and half of the lamb. The lamb was dry, definitely go with the beef kebabs. The couscous was ok, not really great but it probably would have been better to give that before the meat courses because we were getting stuffed. The desserts were fabulous; incredibly fresh fruit,  yummy baklava, and tasty mint tea. The courses were nicely paced and we were finished dinner in a little over 2 hours. All of this for $25 a person! And if you get the wine carafe ($12), get the white wine.  Now for those of you interested in the belly dancer, our dancer was not that great. She seemed nice but we weren't really into it. However, the other incredibly drunk parties were (luckily we only had to deal with them for a few courses).

We ordered the loaded biscuits and gravy, sweet potato hash, and 'chicken' & waffles.   So delicious.  Would LOVE to see a kids' menu at brunch.  The regular portion is a bit too much food, and a little pricy, for our 6yr old. But it tasted good, so we helped eat his meal. :)   Will absolutely be back. Try the noochy grits and the braised kale!  Yum!",

Although it was 10 pm on a Wednesday night, she was hesitant about sitting a party of two at a large table. Perhaps she was expecting a sudden stream of late night diners. The waitress was as sloppy and disheveled as the hostess. No makeup, no hairstyle and clothes that looked as though she found them on the street. I ordered something from the menu that did not have goat cheese listed as one of its ingredients, but she argued with me that the menu did have it listed. I showed her the menu and corrected her. She was rude and had a nasty attitude. I guess I would too if I looked like her. It was $30 for a burger, a salad and two Diet Cokes.The staff is arrogant, the place is filthy and the food is perfect for those who don't care about their health or appearance and like to stuff their faces with a bunch of high fat, high cholesterol, high calorie greasy food. No thanks.",

The low quality soy sauce that came with the sushi was mixed with water - utterly vile.  We also ordered tempura, which was basically an oily, greasy mess - basically deep fried assorted vegetables.   We ended up throwing everything away and cooking our own dinner.

Well, the food was delicious. I had gulf fish meuniere and boyfriend had shrimp & crab etouffee. The fish was really lightly fried with a wonderful meuniere sauce that was just perfect - not too goopy like it can be at cheaper places. The etouffee was awesome, too. It came over pasta, which is unusual, but it totally worked. We also had a St. Charles Streetcar and a Sazerac to drink. No complaints, but also no rave reviews on those.  Now for the reason I gave 3*. I've had more attentive service at Applebee's. And come on, this is a John Besh place we're talking about. Our waiter, Terrione (I think?) barely said 10 words to us. He actually just motioned at the water once instead of asking if we wanted more.

In my humble opinion the more negative or cautious reviews of this particular location are accurate and are consistent with my own experience of the place.  For my own experience, the presentation and cleanliness of the restaurant is fine.  You are greeted with a modern looking fast food restaurant with some nice branding about clean eating.  But once you speak with staff the experience unravels.    I found staff to be more involved in whatever they are up to rather than customer service.  This can involve on going conversations amongst each other, or something else that is not readily apparent.  In any event, some staff are completely distracted or disengaged.  My order took a while to come out, and it required corrections which added more time while customers continued to line up.  Within 30 minutes after enjoying the meal, I became violently ill, and the rest of my evening was basically spent nursing myself back to normal.    I made a complaint many moons ago about this to Mucho Burrito's website, but be forewarned I did not get any follow up whatsoever from them.  This is a demoralized business to the core.    If you are craving Chipotle or some other Mexican branded place, do not come here.  You will be better off for it.

It was pretty busy for a Tuesday night so we expected a little bit of a wait for our meal. But the wait was compounded by service issues.  We ordered the Vietnamese Pancake for an appetizer and Pho and Vermicelli for our entrees. Our order was taken pretty promptly but it took over a half hour for our pancake to be served. A party who arrived after us got their appetizer about ten minutes before us.  It took another twenty minutes to get my vermicelli but Baby's pho was nowhere to be found nor did our server (the older gentleman) offer an explanation or apology. We waited a minute or two but when the pho still didn't come, I flagged down the other (young) server who said he would check into it. He came back apologetically alluding to some issue and promised it would come soon.  Finally, about five minutes later, our original server delivered the pho without a word nor any acknowledgement of a problem. This is the same guy who at our last dinner forgot to place part of our order and then double charged us.   It seems we're not the only ones whose order he screwed up. As we were taking care of our bill, we heard the party behind us pointing out that something was missing from their take-out order.  The owner used to be here frequently but we haven't seen him in quite some time so I'm wondering if in his absence he's taken his eyes off the ball leading to the slippage in service.

I stopped in with my gal pals to take advantage of their happy hour which includes $3.50 screwdrivers and bloody Mary's, which are massive and not light on the liqueur.  We all ordered off of the happy hour menu which had 16 options for $6 dollars apiece.  Their regular menu is also massive so there is sure to be something to satisfy just about anyone.   We ordered zucchini sticks and jalapeno popper for appetizers.  There wasn't really anything special about the jalapeno poppers; there was no spice to them at all.  I'm the type that likes my stuff mild but this was no spice at all!  The zucchini sticks were good and I liked the size, they were more like a big French fry size which made them easier to share.  The zucchini wasn't especially impressive but anything deep fried is usually good.   I ordered the beef sliders with a salad.  Two of my girlfriends got the chicken fingers and another got the chicken Philly.  Mine was certainly the best presentation; it was the best part about the meal too.  My sliders were served on Hawaiian rolls which were good but the patties were actually one hamburger patty cut into four pieces which I thought was really lame... If you're going to serve a slider at least make individual patties for it or don't even bother.  The hamburger was also really dry and had to be doused in mayo and ketchup in order to be eaten without choking.  The salad was good.  My girlfriends that got the chicken fingers were happy with them but I could tell that they probably came frozen and all Bully's did was fry them.  The chicken Philly was definitely the least impressive meal; the chicken was left in huge, tough, chunks and there was mention of quite a bit of gristle which is a deal breaker for me.   My friend picked at it a little but ended up eating hardly any of it.  The service was fine overall; no extra points for great service and no deducts for bad service either.  I would recommend going to Bully's for the great drink specials.  If you are going to get food stick with anything fried; Bully's doesn't get any extra points for being special or unique. The food had a good price but I can't say I would want to pay more than $6.00 for it.  If you want to see any other places I've reviewed check out my blog at: http://jparkhurst07.wordpress.com/",

Starting with a positive. The food was great! However, the criticisms come from the moment I walked into the restaurant. A server who was at the desk completely ignored us as we entered. A young man with no sense of urgency came from across the room where he was seated playing with his phone. We were seated. Our server was actually at our table within minutes but, like I read another review, did not have much of a personality. We ordered food as I was noticing other customers entering. They were also not seated quickly even there seem to be plenty of staff. This happened a few times. The restaurant was filling up quickly and there seemed to be a dispute and confusion about which servers were assigned to which tables. I witnessed at least 2 parties wait at least 5 minutes before a server came to greet and get drink orders. My final complaint is that my waitress forgot an important detail in my order and I was forced to wait too long watching my mother eat her food before I got my breakfast. I do hope that with a little training and good management that service will improve. Sincerely.",

One is how much everything costs, it is worth it but I still feel like the only reason why I don't order there often is that sometimes the good stuff is around $30 for one pizza. My other reason is that sometimes the food will get to you undercooked and that is based on how many toppings it has since they seem to put  all the food items in the same oven for the same amount of time.",

The prices are extremely high in proportion to the food quality and portion size.  A chicken sandwich that is a little bigger than a slider, for $13, no fries.  A side order of fries is $4, and about the same size as fries in a happy meal.  $17 + tax and tip, and unless you're 9 yrs old you will still be hungry.   Pros- The staff seem very friendly.  Especially the redheaded bartender, she is very pleasant and accommodating.  They have a nice beer selection, and you can buy a growler to go of your favorite beer.  The wings are really good too.",

I'm not sure you'll know what I mean by atmosphere unless you're from the Trenton area and are familiar with the Burg or should I say, what used to be the Burg.  Anyhow, the new location has a lovely decor, it just has a very different feel. About the menu, again - it's different.  They could have at least kept the menu the same, right?  The menu is smaller and missing some key items I once enjoyed.    Moderate prices for menu items, while dinner specials were a bit higher in price. Portions were on the small side, as I think I was able to count the number of penne in my side of pasta.  On a more positive note,  we had a party of eight which can sometimes be a problem on a busy Friday night, yet the service was still very good. Now a BYOB.",

It took me three phone calls and two messages which were never returned to even get a reservation. I did inform them that I had a groupon in all messages and conversations. We arrived a few minutes prior to our reservation time and I gave them the groupon as instructed per groupon policy. We were promptly seated but no on came to greet us, take our orders for tea or even just a nod and \"I'll be with you soon\" for over ten minutes. Eventually someone did take our orders and bring out our rasberry sage tea which was \"okay\" but nothing spectacular. My mother's salad and my soup arrived....only my soup had been sloshed all over the small bowl and was running down the side into the paper doily and all over the serving plate. At a tea house, you expect the best service, atmosphere, presentation, etc. and this place and/or staff didn't deliver. Furthermore, my she-crab soup was very watery and really lacked any flavor. The rest of our \"tea\" was \"okay\" but again, nothing special or fabulous in taste or presentation. I do a better job when I entertain in my home with taste and attention to detail. I was trying not to make negative comments as it was my mother's birthday but the real insult came when the bill was presented and I noticed they added an automatic %18 gratuity.......for two people????? I would have tipped well anyway, even though it was not earned, as my son works in the service industry and I typically tip 20%. I wanted to say something but again, I was trying to keep the mood happy for my mom and it wasn't about the money but rather their attitude and greediness.

You literally walk in and no longer feel like you are in Indiana. Everything is sparkly and glittery, and the smells are divine.   We made the trek by uber to this neighborhood and really wanted to try this place! We arrived around 11 for an \"early lunch\" slash \"snack\". We ordered the quiche of the day which was quiche Lorraine and the famous Earls Court Chocolate Cake.  The quiche was quite delicious. The egg was so fluffy and savory while the crust was super flaky and had a great bacon flavor.  This was a perfect snack to split between 2 people and just hit the spot!  It was so hard to decide which cake to try. One gripe that I have about this place is the price of the cake slices. The slices are quite large and pricey. If you only come with 2 people it is hard to get a few things to share without either breaking the bank or stuffing your face with dessert. I asked if we could do 1/2 slices, but was politely denied. A suggestion I have would be to allow fractions of slices so people can try multiple different cakes.  My wife loves chocolate and I love all sweets so we opted for the famous chocolate cake. There was so much great chocolate flavor and for the most part, the cake was super moist. It seemed like the edges of the cake might have been a little over cooked/on the dryer side but the flavor was delightful!",

We called 24 hours in advance and made a reservation for two for the tapan tables for the next evening at 7:30 PM. Upon arriving promptly at 7:30 we were first ignored for 5 to 10 minutes at the door before finally being escorted to our table, where we were seated with two other parties, two couples, one of which was clearly expecting a third person. After waiting for a waitress to arrive to take our order for over 20 minutes, a frowning teenager finally arrived and asked if we were all ready to order. The woman that belonged to the party of three that was still waiting for their third quickly responded that no, she was not ready to order because their third friend had not arrived and the waitress promptly put away her notepad and left the table. WHAT?! Apparently because this group of strangers was not ready to order, the rest of us had to wait to eat. After the third of their party finally arrived at approximately 8PM, half an hour after our reservation time, we were finally able to order. My friend and I chose to order both tapan and sushi, and when the waitress asked if we would like our sushi roll while we were waiting for the chef we said we would. We received no sushi in the next 25 minutes while waiting for the chef to arrive, but rather the roll arrived towards the end of our meal. Overall, the chef was very nice and the food was what I expected of any adequate tapan restaurant. After finishing our meal, we had to beg the waitress several times to finally deliver our check, at this point it was around 9:30PM, we had been at the restaurant for two hours, and were completely exhausted. When she finally delivered it, we were displeased to see that she had charged us full price for our sushi, despite the restaurant's advertisement for half-off sushi during the time we were there.  I will probably return here, but only because it is the only establishment in the entire city with tapan tables. The service is horrible.",

Also, do they really have to serve diet coke in an 8 oz bottle. Can they just give a large glass which will be refilled like every other restaurant?

It's kind of strange because it's pieces of pork chops with spaghetti sauce baked with cheese over rice.  Seriously I could have done without the spaghetti sauce.  A very odd mix.  I think they should have written that in their description.  The soft shell crab was definitely plentiful but it just tasted strange to me.  It seems like they mixed peanut butter in their batter.  It's really dark in color and did not taste right.  I hate leaving bad reviews so I may try them out once more to update my review in the future.",

My husband and I both ordered the blackened grouper  when the meals were delivered I thought my husband's jaw was going to hit the table. Without one bit of exaggeration, the portion of grouper was the size of a fish stick! It came with a couple of pieces of saut\u00e9ed zucchini and squash and our choice of vegetable (French fries).  In addition to being smaller than an appetizer portion, the fish didn't even taste fresh! It was fishy. Plus the restaurant needs a facelift. It's dirty and dated. And the food is way over priced. Save your money. Go across the driveway and have some pizza!",

Although there are tables and chairs outside on the sidewalk (nice touch), it's more of a sit-down place. There is a bar to chill out and have a beer while you wait, but since it was packed we didn't want to stand awkwardly next to a table and wait for a slice to come out.  Interior is nice. I appreciate how clean and well-kept it looks. I think the fact that this place is busy means it must be doing something right.

But we were 7th on the wait list and waited over 2 hours.  We watch while \"celebrities-not\" breezed in from off the streets to be seated in front of myself and other paying customers who also had been waiting for HOURS for what would be a mediocre meal.    We were told that the \"owner was hosting them at his private table.\"  Problem is the place has 20 tables and a bar so if the owner wanted to pay for or host \"celebrities\"  -he/she should've closed for the day.  It's called, \"closed for a private event.\" It felt exclusionary and demoralizing.  What happened to valued customer service?  And then I get inside and order and wait, and wait, and wait another hour before food finally arrives.  My sweet potato pancakes were dense-not moist or fluffy and my spinach and feta omelette was unseasoned and light on the feta. Everything was warm-not hot, not cold-just warm.  Did someone forget to grab from the window on time for a hot plate to arrive to my table?  It wasn't just me though the salmon, bananas foster, and shrimp and grits that my friends ordered all arrived warm.  The grits are dense and bland and not at all cheesy-really.  Once half of our order arrived the waitresses disappeared and we were hunting folks down to ask for silverware hot sauce and syrup.

For appetizers, we ordered the pan seared pork dumplings and sui mai.  Both appetizers were delicious and the dipping sauce was really good.  For the entrees, we ordered the sweet & sour chicken, pan fried noodle with shrimp, and pan fried noodle with beef and black bean sauce.  The sweet & sour chicken was awful - more sweet than sour - and the vegetables in it were really undercooked (pretty much raw).  (I do have to admit that I like things spicy, so maybe this dish just wasn't for me.)  For both pan fried noodle dishes, they were blah with a side of blah.  The beef dish was supposed to be spicy, but I just didn't taste any heat.  I left here full, but unsatisfied.",

Still good, just not baked.  They also had Abita Strawberry and the Blackforest Kolsch. Excellent bar selection!! I'm docking them a star because of the system of ordering at the counter and then taking the plastic number to a table. This system works in theory, and in practice at other places, but you HAVE to keep people from \"saving tables\" when they have yet to order. I get it if you have a group of 10 but for normal sized tables, it throws the whole system off! The line was long last night but the food comes out fast so tables turn over quickly. By the time we ordered there were no open tables. There were around 8 tables taken up by people who were still 20 minutes from ordering. That throws the whole system off! Let people who have already ordered eat. Another table will open up for you by the time you order! This can easily be solved by posting a sign and asking the servers to enforce it.  Luckily there were two spots open at the bar.  On a side note, the bartender was awesome: fast, attentive, and knowledgeable. I may just sit there in the first place next time!",

First with Graeters and secondly (and more often once Graeters appeared more places) with their outstanding to-go sandwiches and pastry selection.  This location, however, lacks an impressive (or even good) pastry section. Their pastry case is all of two or three feet long. The one in St. Louis? Probably four times that length.   Where were the cream puffs? The non mini tarts? Or any fruit tarts besides mixed berry? Where were the french inspired pastries? Or the vegan ones? Where was any of this?  Instead there were pudding cups (I bought one - it was very pretty and did use very rich chocolate, but was still just a bit better than a normal pudding cup), creme brulee, two types of macaron flavors, and only a few cakes (albeit I am sure you can call in advance to order others as you can at most Whole Foods). There were mini tarts, but all the same mixed berry flavors... There was no layered deserts or tiramisu.  It was just a below average bakery selection and it left me sad (as I had driven there hungry and wanting pastries)  Maybe the other location in Indy will prove more fruitful? (Or pastry case full)",

Average looking storefront with the choice of table seating or sushi bar seating. The tables a bit cramped, especially the two person tables, and it isn't a particularly group friendly place. The room is crowded and smaller tables are uncomfortably close to each other.   Seems like a family business, or at least I hope it is because a few of the waitstaff are downright rude. Every single thing you ask them for--be it water, chopsticks, extra ginger for gods sake--is a huge favor they're imparting to you. Don't even bother waiting for your server to take your food and drink order; call them over unless you want to be there for a couple hours or more, since the food also takes a while to prepare. This would be one thing if it was the best sushi in town, but it most certainly is not. Fish is fresh, but it is at pretty much any other mid-priced sushi restaurant in a 7 mile radius due to the town's location. Both times I've come neither toro nor uni we're on the menu...we're in Santa Barbara! Uni is shipped internationally from this city, you'd think a local restaurant could manage to have some on hand. Their specialty rolls are heavily covered in baked mayonnaise and overly battered and fried. So, go simple the next time, I thought. I ordered a spicy scallop roll, a salmon skin roll, and soft shell crab to split. Spicy scallop roll again had too much mayonnaise, though it was wrapped very well, and the soft shell crab was heavily tempura battered so much that there was more batter than crab. They were out of salmon skin, which would have been OK if they'd told me from the get-go. Instead, they brought my other food out and said they were out of salmon skin. Great, now if I order another dish it will come out later.   Instead, I'll finish my food and come back never.",

We heard about it from a friend who turned us on to the spicy cucumbers, which are just wonderful.  Eventually I tried the University City location, and it's much more \"hip.\"  I really don't care about ambiance, but if you are seeking a more polished/trendy type of place, go to University City over Manayunk.  The food in both places is just incredible.  Han Dynasty serves food in very large, family sized portions.  It's most fun when you are with a bit of a group, so you can order a number of different things, and try them all.  On their \"specials\" menu, they have Spicy Aroma Fish which is just absolutely beyond this world.  SO good.  Another major hit was the dry pot style.  My wife and I are big seafood fans, so we get shrimp as the protein, but you have complete flexibility to pick whichever protein suits your taste.  They have numbers on the menu, 1-10, beside each dish.  This is the relative spiciness rating.  It's really hard to describe the type of heat in these Szechuan dishes... it isn't the kind of heat that just burns your mouth.  The heat is very strong, but it's all flavor.    Dry pepper style is another type of preparation that we have tried and loved.  Several reviews mention the Dan Dan noodles... they are wonderful, but they are indeed rather oily.  It's just the nature of this cuisine.  I think the food is wonderfully prepared, one just has to know that chili oil and sesame oil will make the food a bit on the oily side.

The string beans were fried in stale tasting oil and the boss won't admit it had a bad taste to it. The walnut sprimp that we ordered were fried in extra thick batter. the small sprimp turned into a fat corn dog looking thing. Our last dish, orange beef was also covered in thick breading, beef was not tender, hard to chew and it had crazy amount of glaze glob on it. Horrible Horrible...I was super disappointed after wanting to visit there for a while. Dont waste your money. This is not how Chinese food should taste like!",

Thank you Yelpers for delivering another great place!  A reconverted 1960's era A & W chain fast food stand [I can detect those old bone shards still!], we enjoyed a wonderful meal at a reasonable price.  I had the catfish smothered in poblano sauce and melted cheese.  They told me it was farm catfish but it tasted like the catfish I used to catch out of a lake near my house as a little kid.  Farm fish never tastes this real.  My wife had chile relleno - fresh peppers, not surprising this time of year but definite kudos to the chef.  The late-stage adolescents with us enjoyed their enhiladas and chimichangas too.",

She was efficient and refilled my water glass, but was not particularly pleasant or welcoming.  The big disappointment was the matzoh ball soup, $6 for a bowl.  It looked delicious, but it was not. The matzoh balls were cold and bland: tasteless.  I make a much better matzoh ball soup from a mix.  The reuben sandwich ($11) was small, but delicious.  The potato salad was a good sized portion and tasty. Bagged chips are served with the sandwich, not appealing.  \"Not bad\" is the best I can say for the meal overall.",

All other tables were clean and had no lingering bento boxes or empty soda bottles. Dirty tables is my biggest pet peeve in faster food establishments!   We each ordered a Bento, mine with tempura and \"dumplings\" his with tempura and sushi. They both came out looking quite appetizing and very generous.   The beef teriyaki tasted like roast beef sandwich meat with bottled teriyaki sauce. And the rice was cold and mushy. Likely over cooked! My dumplings were bland and I gave them to the BF to finish, the bento came with 3 and I only ate one. The small salad of carrot and bean sprouts were probably the best thing in the box. Actually no, the tempura yam was! It was light and not overly greasy, but still nothing to write home about. As for the fruit... Well... It was canned and all tasted the same, syrupy and canny!

It's kind of like Sunterra in that it's mostly self serve, though there is a soup (4 different kinds) and sandwich/panini/breakfast counter at the back. Lots of choices for drinks (water, soda, kombucha, etc), snacks (like individually wrapped cheese, $0.85 a piece) and desserts (cookies, candies). A decent-sized salad bar with a variety of leafy greens (all looking fresh) and lots of toppings (chicken breast, deli meat, other vegetables). The hot food self-serve area also has about 10 choices ($1.89/100g) - several meats (today was roast beef au jus, roast chicken legs with mashed potatoes and gravy on the side, butter chicken, and another Indian dish), a fish (I think it was breaded), perogies (with self serve bacon and sour cream... dangerous), and some veggies (steamed broccoli and cauliflower, roasted potato wedges), and I assume there is always a vegetarian dish - today's was lasagna. I may have forgotten about a few other dishes. Everything is labelled and relatively fresh - I saw them replenishing lots of dishes even before it got down to the very end undesirable bits.   I enjoyed the mishmash I picked up. You use take out styrofoam containers so you can always bring home leftovers. The lasagna was cheesy and flavourful, despite not having any meat in it. The noodles were not as al dente as I would have liked and it was a touch salty, but overall I liked it. The broccoli was perfectly steamed to retain nutrients - still bright green and just a touch of crunch. The roast chicken was really popular - I don't know if it was legs only but I snagged the last piece of thigh in a sea of drumsticks - skin was still kind of crispy and seasoned with some herbs (indistinguishable though). A touch dry but totally edible still. I loved the perogies - they were very generic potato ones, nothing special but not bad (e.g., the right amount of dough and filling, not mushy). I loved being able to choose as much sour cream and bacon bits (real ones!) as I wanted.   There's quite a bit of seating and a lot of people seem to get the food to go, so I didn't have any trouble finding a spot for two around 12:15pm (it was busy though!). After grabbing a bottle of premium water, my total came to about $13, and I was certainly quite full. You can spend as much or as little as you want to. I thought the food was decent despite it being made for the masses, and I love the variety of choices - I understand that they change offerings daily so I'd be interested to try other options. I think it's a really great option for the people who work on this west end of downtown (note it's closed on weekends). I will be back!",

Probably the most hipster restaurant I've been to in Reno, but I would not recommend this place if you're trying to have an intimate date night. The music in the restaurant is super loud.   Service: After my boyfriend and I were seated, it took the waiter at least 15 minutes to get us water. The food took a long time to come out and our main dishes came out at different times. After finishing dinner, we asked for the check and I think the waiters completely forgot about us because we had to wait another 10-15 minutes. I would expect restaurants to want to turn tables over quickly, but for some reason service was super slow. For the poor customer service and overall dining experience, three stars.  Food: Tried the crab croquet. Pretty tasty, but I don't think it warrants the high price tag. Three crab croquets for $13 is a little steep.  Also had the spicy miso ramen ($16) and the wicked fried rice with duck cracklings ($14). I'd say the ramen here is probably better than other places I've been to in Reno, but nearly double the price. The broth wasn't super rich, but presentation and little vegetables were nice. The wicked fried rice was pretty good. The cracklings definitely add texture and the duck on top was cooked well.",

We were there a few days ago and I noticed that they had red spapper. Didn't like that they were headless because you really can't tell if they're fresh or not. No clear or cloudy eyes. Nonetheless I picked out 2 nice sized ones and asked if he would filet them. By the way he looked at me you'd have thought I had 2 heads. He got nervous and stammered that he could not do that. Geeze Acme....put someone in this department that can actually perform customer service!  I was actually shocked to see that they had a crown rib roast in the meat department the other day. I didn't think they could do something that complicated. However, I might add, that for an expensive cut of meat as it was, it was horribly wrapped with bones cutting through the plastic wrap.

It is unique, somewhere between the Steve's (whole flat slice) and Jim's (chopped to death) presentation.  It works REALLY well, texture-wise.  Liscio's rolls were fresh and shiny, and the Wacky Wednesday deal of a large for six bucks was fortuitous. They usually have SOME kind of deal going though.. Meat was tasty and not gristly, the white American cheese melted like a dream (but short of the sauce that Steve's is.)  I got more meat than my son did, but both were acceptable portions.  Fried onions were 1/4 inch cubes, and caramelized beautifully.   Crinkle cut fries only get so good, but these were pipjng hot, and the Whiz that came on the side worked great on the sammy as well.  Lots of people on Yelp complained about the Whiz, but I could see it along with American as a great combo.Whiz is what Whiz is.  Possibly the REAL best thing here is the 1949 vibe.  This place is a time capsule, where only the prices have changed (and pretty minimally at that) over five decades.  Everything (including real fountain sodas) are made to order. Milkshakes (the half and half was very popular)  were killer.   Waitstaff is attentive and friendly as you are likely to find on the East Coast.

    "text": "This is my usual, but only because my neighborhood has NO grocery store, even though it's been 5 1/2 years since Katrina...   Anyway, the parking lot is a freaking death trap. People park in the fire lanes and clog up the aisles with their poor parking. A lot of this probably has to do with the fact that this place is the only grocery store for A LOT of people. The produce is unreliable, except they have a board by the front door that lists the local produce, which I LOVE, and use to buy as locally as possible. All other Rouse's don't have this, but they should. A few of the gentlemen that work in produce are helpful in answering questions about when items will return or where they are, etc.   The bakery grinds out new fresh bread every day, and most of it is really tasty. Warning, though, they don't list the nutritional information on the packages, so you might get something you don't want in your tummy..  They've recently added a \"natural\" section, which has organic and all natural food/beauty products. This makes me very happy, but I usually buy the Rouse's brand organic canned goods because they are cheaper.    As I mentioned earlier, this place serves as the sole provider of groceries to a lot of people. What that means to you is that on busy times (at like, 6 pm, or right before saints games..), it is so busy that you can't go in an aisle without smashing into someone, and it gets really frustrating. I try to go on \"off\" times and pray for the day when they re-open the store on Elysian Fields.",

Instead of two crabcakes as pictured I got one crabcake cut in half and the piece of salmon was half th size as pictured (less than 6 oz, 1 inch high in the middle by 1 in wide by 6 in long). The white linen napkins are so old that they left white lint all over our clothes. I watched a woman, not in typical waitress clothes (maybe a manager of some sort) go to one table with only a single balled up cloth and proceed to wipe the tablet top, pushing the food bits to the bench seats. Next she wiped the seats, pushing the food bits to the floor. She then moved to the adjacent empty table and did the same procedures again. Talk about contamination. No soap was ever used. The restaurant had a bad odor when we entered sort of like the carpeting had not been deep cleaned in a long time. After seeing the woman's table \"cleaning\" method it all made sense. I wish I had seen that before we ordered. I gave it two stars because the food tasted fine even if the portions were abbreviated.

We ordered an appetizer of the fried calamari, and it did not come out in 20-30 minutes. When we asked about it, they said it would be right out, but our entrees came out first!   Then, they had the nerve to ask us if we still wanted our appetizer. We said that we did, and it eventually showed up. They did not offer to take it off of our bill, and they seemed so busy that our dissatisfaction was the least of their worries. Our meal was definitely overpriced for the service we received.   My second experience was with their catering dept. I wanted to have limoncello cater my wedding. I called in October, made an appointment to come into the restaurant the first week in November to sample food and discuss my vision. They called and cancelled the same day due to a family emergency (which I totally understand!). But then I didn't hear from them in over a week to reschedule!

The waitress finally came out. We had been lured in by the menu spread open on said sidewalk table - specifically, the coconut hush puppies and mezze plate. I also wanted coffee. Unfortunately, they were only serving their brunch menu which included neither of those things. It, in fact, consisted only of 1 page of entre\u00e9s, no small plates and nothing really sharable. Oh yes, and it would be a 20 minute wait for coffee \"because they use a percolator\". Luckily, Gosling's was on the drink menu, which had several interesting N/A beverage options, to my delight. I ordered one of those, a white/green tea blend, my companion got a cherry lemonade and the vegetarian breakfast burrito with black beans sans avocado.

Rice was overcooked to the point it was unrecognizable. It was mush. There was no curry. It taste more like a bland Indian dish which I have never had. The spices were there but there was no salt. The dosa was mushy. It was disgusting!   Next stop K-TOWN KOREAN FRIED CHICKEN: $8 for 4 chicken wings supposedly cooked Korean Style. Save your time and your money and go straight to Cafe Soho! The wings were breaded and there was more breading than chicken. What a let down.   Then on to THE COW AND THE CURD: $14 for gloriFRIED cheese and a frozen lemonade. It was a fancier version of a mozzarella stick. Sadly enough this is what I enjoyed the most. What left the bitter tast in my mouth from the visit to this truck? I was with friends from Atlanta who came to Philly for the Night Market so I wanted to share. I asked the OWNER for an extra dish to split the curds and his reply \"NO, WE HAVE NO EXTRA DISHES. TRY USING A NAPKIN.'' As I looked behind him to mounds of extra paper containers. Wow, way to loose a customer buddy.   Now on to RELISH: $8 for Chicken In Waffles, yes people pieces of chicken were chopped up and  infused in the mini waffles, add a pat of maple syrup butter on top, yum yum. Sounds amazing right??? Yeah that's what I was thinking until I bit in to the waffle and my pallet was met by the DISGUSTING taste of DARK MEAT CHICKEN. My entire body quivered as I spit the waffle in to a napkin!  Come on RELISH, you should disclose this as not everyone has the stomach for dark meat...in the trash it went.  I will not be returning to this Night Market! I saw the reviews but I really tried to give this one the benefit of the doubt. We were so disappointed we ended up driving to Jim's Steaks in West Philly to satisfy our food cravings. I will give the one in Chinatown a try in the Fall. My suggestions to my Foodies, avoid this one...",

I'm a greater Seattle area girl at heart, so I love finding these little drive-up coffee stands. No matter where I'm at, if I spot one I have to try it out. In Hendersonville you will not find better coffee than this place.   2. Manual machines. If you really appreciate espresso, then you'll appreciate the importance of what a manual espresso machine does for the taste of your drink.   3. Great location. On a main strip, easy to get in and out of.  4. Double-sided drive up windows. And no call/order box. The best coffee stands put you face to face with your barista right from the start.  5. After coming here twice, the OWNER had me (an out-of-towner) and my drink memorized.   If you love GREAT coffee, don't pass this place up.",

I just went to pick up lunch to eat back at work - I watched a worker prepare my salad and didn't see her include any cheese.  I looked closer as she packed it up and even asked \"Excuse me, I'm sorry, is there cheese in this?\" to which she indignantly muttered 'YES.\"  I took her word for it - must've missed her add it.  I pay $10 for my salad, drive back to work, AND THERE'S NO CHEESE ON MY SALAD.

That is, when you can actually get it, which is unfortunate because this place could have incredible potential if the staff was competent.   Flashback to a month or two ago. The weather was about to get bad, so the g/f and I decided to order some food to go before the storm came in. We placed an online order through their website. We arrived at the time the site said the food would be ready, only to be met with puzzled stares from the staff. They had received no online order. We showed the cashier the order confirmation and they informed us the online ordering system was having some issues. Ok, fine.  Fast forward to today, about an hour ago, the g/f and her friend wanted to meet up for brunch, so we decided on coming here. Their menu clearly states that brunch is \"All Day Sunday, 9am - 4 pm\". We get in line and begin to order brunch, when the cashier girl tells us they're, \"Not doing brunch today.\" I told her that was the whole reason we came. She replied that they were having some, \"Complications\" - whatever that means. Strike one.  I order a sugar-free vanilla latte. My g/f, who was standing next to me, told me they didn't have any. Before I showed up, she ordered a sugar-free vanilla coffee and was told by the girl cashier that they didn't have any sugar-free vanilla syrup. When I asked if they did (I had ordered this on my first visit), the cashier girl asked and magically they had a full bottle of sugar-free vanilla syrup. Strike two.  We then place our food orders. I ordered a sandwich with a \"V\" in the name. It's not on their online menu, but it is on the menu in the store. It has turkey, bacon, cheese and avocado. I pay and then find my seat. Shortly after ordering, the same guy who took my order comes out to our table to tell us they don't have any avocado! STRIKE. THREE.  If you like to be forced into ordering something you didn't want because what you do want is not being offered that day, go here.   I've been here twice and both times have been complete failures.

The shrimp peel was brown, they were probably cooked about a month ago, put in a freezer and served them to me as they thawed. Their jambalaya was further than the truth. It was pasta in tomato sauce with a minuscule piece of chicken. And the fact that I had to pay as I left was bewildering.

The space is well maintained with many booths and tables, and an amiable server corps dressed in tan and green that actually seems to enjoy interacting with their customers.    True to its cultural roots, the cuisine tends toward sweetness, and even their spicy dishes maintain a hint of sugar just behind the chili flavors.  Our Orange Beef and General Tso Shrimp came either drowned in heavy sweet amber, or had it on the side.  Both were framed in Broccoli Florets, the much overused non-Chinese veggie. Their tastes were fine, but we all commented on the unexpected sugariness of the platters.  The Spicy Shrimp, Scallop & Squid with Pepper Corn Salt, was a relief from the cane, and would have been completely on target had it all been crisper.

As I was eating I found a HUGE piece of Brillo pad in my food. I was annoyed because I truly enjoyed the 3 fries I did eat. They take my food and my mom gives me half of her BLT. As I go to take a bite I notice there's MOLD all over the roll. Unfortunately, she has already eaten the other half of her sandwich. They let us go without being charged for drinks.  Tonight I tried again for dinner and it was a fail. I got the gnocchi's with sherry and tomatoes and it was terrible. Barely any sauce that looked more like a glaze. The gnocchi's were hard and bland. I literally had about 6 gnocchi's and was hoping maybe the waitress or hostess would ask if my food was okay but they didn't. My food looked like it wasn't touched!! It's my own fault for not speaking up but Ive never returned food because I just didn't like it... even though this was on another level of bad. I payed $18 for a meal I did not eat. I think unfortunately I'm done with blue plate.",

We experimented with the polenta fries, and they were not good (but I've never had them before so take that with a grain of salt). The scallop and risotto was just ok, I was expecting a better dish and I'd give it a 6/10. The other dishes ordered were the manicotti, and the chicken parm which both proved to be average in flavor and quality. You could easily get better quality from a local pizzeria. The side of meatballs was anticlimactic, borderline bland as hell.  Nothing was overwhelmingly horrible, but I expected more considering all the hype.

Later our order taker cleaned off the rest of the tables, and did a mediocre job of sweeping the floors. Not bad, but enough to make you ask yourself how well they manage their crew.   Okay, on with the food. They called out our order and the Quesadillas came out piping hot. We had to wait a few minutes to eat them. Each 12\" Quesadilla was served on a tray lined with foil. A handful of lettuce graced the presence of the correlating international sauce (eg. Italian, Greek, Mexican), served in a small cup.  Tzatkiki, for example, with the Greek.   I opened the Greek and it was steaming hot with gooey cheese, black olives, and banana pepper. I added lettuce for more depth. The flavors were mild, but tasty. Nothing that really wowed me or that I could not make at home.  I ate half and took the rest home.  The New Orleans style was made with blackened chicken, red pepper and bacon nestled in melted cheese (of which he could not recall). He said he liked it. That was all. He fussed more over the cookie than he did over the Quesadilla. The cookies looked amazingly tasty.   We agreed that, while this place was okay, it would not make our list of frequented establishments.",

We also got a salad and it was ok.  Hard to mess up a salad.  Then came the entrees. Our son got the squid.  The menu said it was \"lightly coated with flour and pan fried to perfection.\"  Nope.  The coating was thick and mouth coating.  The squid was overcooked like rubber.  I got the \"Greek style\" grouper.  Again, it was heavily battered with little seasoning.  The batter, like the squid, was mouth coating.  The fish was over cooked and greasy.  \"Greek style\" I suppose referred to the fact that they dumped some nasty granulated garlic (not fresh) over the top of the deep fried fillet.  My wife got Greek style scallops.  I did not try them, but she pronounced that the dish was like something they would serve in a nursing home.

    "text": "My husband and I stopped here for lunch on a Saturday afternoon around 2-ish.  The restaurant was completely empty.  We inquired if they were even open and a nice lady said they were and proceeded to seat us.   Their menu did not offer as many options of meat types or dishes as most Mexican restaurants do here in Indianapolis.  My husband ordered a margarita and the special of the day, Chilaquilles con salsa verde y pollo at $6.99 and I ordered a carne asada burrito at $7.99 and water to drink. Chips and salsa were brought to the table.  Chips were  fried there, and while I like that style of chip (thin, often bubbles into thin layers) but were cold and very greasy.  Salsa was sweet but had some heat in the finish.  It was easy to eat a lot of those! When our meals came to the table, frankly, they were underwhelming.  My burrito tortilla looked/felt like it was not heated at all and cutting into my burrito was disappointing.  There was lots of lettuce and tomato, a scoop of a white rice (not spanish rice) and there was supposed to be mozzarella cheese in it but couldn't taste or see it.  The carne asada was thinner than a strip of bacon.  Unfortunately, I would be generous in saying there was maybe 2 ounces of beef.  In all honesty, there was no more meat in it than two strips of bacon, diced.  My husband mentioned it to the person (owner) with a quick \"sorry\" muttered and no offer to do anything.   While the combination of ingredients was not improperly prepared, there are 100 other Mexican restaurants in town I can spend $8.00 on a burrito and it would be generously filled with meat. As for my husband's chilaquilles, I order this all the time from Biscuits in Broad Ripple and this was another disappointment.  This was chips, salsa verde, one fried egg and a very thin boneless piece of grilled chicken.  My husband felt as I did.  Not poorly prepared but completely lacking any substance.  During the time we spent in this restaurant, there was not one other customer coming or going.  With the lack of substance to the food, I suspect most people will feel as I did and would not waste their time coming back here.  There is no way this restaurant can survive when prices are the same as other Mexican restaurants but quality is far less.  Sadly, I was even mad that we spent $25.00 at this place and left just to drive to a fast food restaurant so we could get some quick, cheap protein.   I will chalk this up to a learning experience.  Folks, save your money and go to Rosita's or Margaritas U.S. 31, Leonardo's or even El Meson.",

So, I ate the dressed salad. Twenty minutes later, the bartender finally came by, and asked if I had received the catfish fingers. I had not.  The bartender ducked into the kitchen, came back, and assured me that a fresh order of catfish was being made for me. Waited (in vain) for another 30 minutes. When I had been waiting a total of 50 minutes and had still not received my food, I asked for a check (minus the catfish) and a manager. The manager heard my story and professed to be astounded, and he assured me he was going to investigate in the kitchen as to what went wrong. Then he jumped up and left.  Anytime that I've experienced a restaurant malfunction of this magnitude, I've been offered some measure of hospitality. Neither the bartender nor the manager cared enough to offer me a drink, a dessert, or any other compensation for the time I wasted trying to have a simple lunch.

Point to Cactus: The staff is on top of stuff for their regular customers.  The service can be a little slow at times, but once we get a table full of margarita pitchers life is beautiful. The 'ritas themselves aren't the most consistent (this week's were a little heavy on the juice) but for $10 I'm not complaining. And, to reply to one of the posts, they definitely don't skimp on the tequila. In fact, the bartender measures out the liquor for ever pitcher. Margaritas are pretty sweet so you can't taste it too much, and I'm sure it isn't quite as much as you'd get in a non-special, but believe me it's there.  My most serious gripe, actually, is the music. Don't know who puts the mixes on, but I protest. They actually played 'Closing Time' the other night - at 10:00, when people were still coming in.

So that's my only negative part about this place.   Fried pickle chips, delicious! Make sure you let them cool, they taste so much better when they're not burning hot.",

We were a party of 7 adults and 2 children, and were seated in an area with other children, which is fine with me - might as well keep all the noise in one area  :-)  I had the Chicken Jack and Bacon sandwich, which had a good size hunk of chicken in it, along with the cheese, bacon, tomato and onion, but strangely absolutely no sauce or dressing of any kind, making it rather dry.  Other than that, it was good, and everyone else seemed content with their meal.  Our server was attentive and patient, and all our meals were served at the same time, eliminating that awkward \"waiting\" stage that often happens with larger parties.  However, there was bad news - the children's meal no longer includes a dessert of Dirt and Worms, which (as silly as it may seem) has always been the main attraction of Tony Roma's if kids are along.   We had to pay an extra dollar for a small scoop of freezer-burned vanilla ice cream which neither child finished, nor any adult wanted to eat because of the crystallization of it.  It's funny how Dirt and Worms has become a tradition for us, and the meal didn't seem complete without it.  Hey, Tony, you may have lost some customers over that pudding and cookie crumbs and gummy worm \"cost-cutting\" elimination.

Take note though, chips and salsa are not included with your purchase and must be bought separately. Now let me get to the best part-the made to order, chunky guacamole. The hardy chips would definitely withstand this heavy duty guac, but I opted instead for tortillas as my vessel to stuff it with along with my beans and salsa.

White House, Tony Luke's, Geno's, Pudge's - like comparing apples and pigs, or Wilt to Magic, or Kung Fu to Karate, you just can't compare iconic examples different styles.  Larry's is like that. I've been coming for 30 years. Once or twice, I even stepped up to the Houseway Belly Filler. I think this was the first place I ever had a meat topping on a steak sandwich (pepperoni), but it wasn't the last.   What makes Larry's Larry's? First, the guy is cooking in the window. Next, the steaks are chopped. Not shredded, fluffed, laid out or shingled. Even the toppings on our chicken cheese steak hoagie were chopped - a devout nod to every-bite-the-same sandwich science. A lot of work goes into every steak. Finally, the fresh Amoroso-style roll is just a little toasted, not enough to be a grinder, but certainly not steamed on the grill like an AC sub.   When on Hawk Hill and hungry go to Larry's. Is it the best steak ever? Nah, but it is an institution and true to itself. As you take your first bite, envision yourself bustin curfew on the way home from seeing Neil Young at the Spectrum, or watching the Sixers take the NBA crown, or sweating whether Y2k will crash your Palm II.

We were seated and ordered the artichoke dip and a flatbread pizza. The artichoke dip came out. Most of the chips were small pieces. Hardly suitable for dipping. The waitress did not bring us flatware or napkins. She seemed to disappear so we had to flag someone down to get those. The flat bread pizza was something kids could make. On grocery store flatbread and pre fab low cost ingredients.  To me the biggest disappointment was the level of food served for the price. Expected higher quality for the price. The appetizer was sub par at 9 bucks with bits of chips and the grocery store flatbread at 15 bucks was unimpressive. Probably won't go back because there are local non-chain restaurants that are far better.",

We love cuban food so try it often from several places and nothing ever compares the quality food and service you get from Liborios.  The food is always hot and taste amazing. The amount of food your get for the price is enough to feed 2. My husband often go and we get one large pressed cuban and one potato ball and one deviled crab and 2 drink. We share the cuban.  And on the way out we pick up one dinner and its plenty to feed 2 and have left over for lunch next day.  Just for over $5.   The Stuffed potato balls are amazing, the size of a grapefruit and have real ground hamburger inside with seasonings and green olives.    We went to West Tampa Sandwich Shop on armenia today and had the worst experience and will never go back. The food and service can not compare to Liborios.  The stuffed potato balls are so small and I cant even tell you what the creamy meat (?) mixture was inside but can tell you Im pretty sure they are the exact same stuffed potato balls we get from Publix Deli.    Keep up the great service and awesome food Liborios.",

    "text": "Little did I know there's an alternate route heading deeper into Santa Barbara County with the 154, and perhaps the one of the things that make the little detour worth the drive is making a stop into this quaint little spot.   The tavern used to be an old stagecoach stop back in the days people used actual horsepower to power their transport, and the original structures seem to have been kept intact from those days. The clientele mostly consists of people who like to take their transport of choice and drive it around with people who have similar transports of choice as they (READ: bikers and people with cool, classic cars). The place itself is split into two structures: the tavern and the restaurant.   We were there for lunch, so we got to sit in the room with the big window and HUGE fireplace. The menu is fairly small but offers a nice selection, and I went for their standard, famous chili (I dare not try their \"fancy\" chili with black beans and wild game including rabbit...I don't eat the bunnies :C ), and I decided to have it atop a plate of fries. Very very yummy. I had a lavender martini to go with it, which was made with  fresh lavender picked from the outside! That was okay. The winner, however, was The Smuggler, a spirited dessert coffee drink made with creme de menthe (or peppermint schnapps?). Now I'm a HUGE mint fiend, and I already expected it wouldn't be minty enough for me, but surprisingly perfectly minty!   The prices of everything isn't a great deal, but it's still pretty fair.  I took a peek into the actual tavern, which was pretty cool looking. I'd gladly have a drink in there, or outside the place, as you can do and would want to do on a nice day as it was when I went, but by no means am I going to have a hankerin' to drive allll the way over there just to have a few cold ones. All the same, if ever I'm the area again, I wouldn't hesitate upon the suggestion to go here (READ: I'd more likely go here before I go to Pink's again).",

He looks up and says, \"Oh, just sit anywhere. \". We sat ourselves and menus were brought to us. About 10 minutes later, he got up and asked if we wanted to order. By this time, we really didn't, but were already invested in the bad experience, that we went ahead and ordered. The food took forever  and was horrible. The sauce tasted like someone opened a can of Hunts tomato sauce and poured it on the enchiladas. There were no refills of drinks, and I had to go get him (still reading his novel) when it was time for us to pay. I thought, \"What a slug\". Horrible service, horrible food, and horrible experience. The place was so mismanaged -- rest room was filthy, from training of employees to quality of food.

Since we were just two, we were quickly seated. We started off with a couple Highland stouts. It was a nice drink and at a reasonable price. Before our entree, we shared a large garden salad. It was fresh and flavorful. The dressing was a bit on the heavy side for a vinaigrette.   For entrees, I had the Black and Blue burger with fries. The burger was just incredible. It was perfectly cooked. The blue cheese was not overpowering. The bun was soft and fresh. The side of regular fries were crisp and lightly salted. Even better, they went perfectly with the homemade ketchup. I'm not a fan of ketchup, but theirs is very nice since they seem to avoid adding too much sweetness. My son had a basic burger with sweet potato fries. I tried the sweet potato fries and think they might be some of the best I've ever eaten. The burger looked as good as mine and my son concurred.

    "text": "Alrighty. I live right next to this place and decided to grab something to eat for lunch there because I felt obligated after being here for half a year just about and I must say that it left so many things to be desired.  First off I noticed the hours are just weird. There is no rhythm of reason for the shifting of hours that they do. We'll be open normal hours on Tuesday/Wednesday, but screw around and put Thursday on a totally different time!? To me that makes 0 since, but I'm sure they have reasons.  Secondly, I love to eat whatever and have the God given ability to do as so without gaining any weight. I actually lose weight the older I get. That being said, I don't see how over half of your menu is fried food. I felt like I was working for FEMA again and in some hole in the wall truck stuff where that was my only option. I wanted a lunch portion and my only option felt like it was fried.  Finally has to be the customer service. When I ask what does your \"fully dressed\" come with. Don't say lettuce, tomatoes, and things like that. Everyone does it different. I am not cool with just taking the lettuce and tomatoes off and sticking with the \"stuff like that\" option. I know I can ball park it, but is that mayo? Is it mustard? Do you have something crazy that is unique that you put on there? Sorry I don't go there all the time and have it detailed out.  As for the good traits that earned this place an average review.  I did appreciate that my \"large\" beer, was actually a huge beer. It was actually a challenge to drink it. The glass was awkward, but all in all it was a hefty challenge for a lunch beer.  I also like the old diner look. When I was growing up, my family would always go to places with this look and it was a warm setting. I would go back and try some of their other options besides fried seafood. Even though they said they add a 18% grat on your ticket, they didn't on mine. That saved them from getting a terrible review as well.  All in all, I would go back to this place, but it would have to be for diner. I would love to feel nauseated over their batter again, but I think I'm going to have to back off this time.",

I have zero complaints about the staff. They would obviously go out of their way to help anyone. Every bartender, every catering staffer, every hotel desk person, all of them, were SO customer-service oriented. Excellent all around in this area.  The hotel rooms (standard room, paid $99 a night for a Fri. and Sat. in early August) look nice now because they are relatively new but I am not sure they will hold up over time. Very spacious for such a low price and the views are great.   However, the room walls are paper-thin. I mean PAPER!! I heard everything (even the normal volume conversations -- in detail--- happening in the room next door). My neighbors also had a baby that cried for over 3 hours one day which made napping impossible. I have never heard so much through a hotel room wall before. This is a definite problem and I suspect they hear a lot about it from patrons.  Another review mentioned that the room lighting is bad. This is true. It was nearly impossible to put on makeup even though they had a nice magnification mirror in the bathroom. I tried every spot and couldnt find a place with lighting. I ended up sitting by the window because it was still daylight and holding up my tiny compact on the couch. This is a small but highly frustrating thing for a woman.   The shower and bathrooms are very nice in the rooms. High quality and the water was warm. I really liked the bathroom. So clean, too!  The TVs are pretty neat because you can check-out on them.  The free wi-fi was spotty and made me login again on their page over and over.   The AV in the meeting rooms was cruddy. The mics went in and out and had a lot of interference. However the system is built-in rather than set up like most AV places, so I guess you get what you pay for.  The art in all the conference rooms was gorgeous but it was so cold in all of them that I left my meeting to go defrost. I am not an \"always cold\" person -- lots of other people were frosty too.  Conference room catering was good for the most part. Some things were high quality and delicious, others felt and tasted very mediocre chain-like. Hit and miss.  The pool was always crowded with families. Not a relaxing environment at all.   Spa service menu was very reasonably priced but not a lot of options. No deep tissue massage?!  I would go back.

The waitress brought out salads for everyone when we clearly reminded her twice that we wanted two soups. And the soup tasted a little watered down and bland. Our waitress took forever to refill our drinks. When she finally did, she refilled the other two people's drinks and completely skipped past us. The food wasn't uniformly cut so there were big chunks of meat and vegetables. And when it came time to pay, we had a coupon for buy three hibachi dinners get one dinner of equal or lesser value for free. And they wouldn't take the coupon. So they had to end up making us another hibachi dinner on top of all the food we ordered. It was just a big hassle instead of taking the coupon and having the manager explain to us instead of our waitress who clearly had an attitude by the time she brought our check back. Needless to say, we won't be back...",

Common theme with this place was while the pizza was good, the service was not so good.  Took a shot and right out of the gate experienced the poor customer service.  With my pizza I ordered something called \"monkey bread\". The menu online only lists one kind of \"monkey bread\"-garlic and parmesan.  When the food arrives I open the \"monkey bread\" and find bread knots with cinnamon and frosting...... So I call back thinking I had mistakenly gotten something from another customer's order.  Turns out there are two types of \"monkey bread\" and I ended up with something I didn't want.  They offered to give us a free \"monkey bread\" the next time we ordered from them or would give us one now if WE DROVE THERE to pick it up!!!!! Are you kidding??! I've got hot pizza that you just delivered and I'm supposed to let it get cold driving to your restaurant to fix something you screwed up???!!! How in the world could we have known there was another kind of \"monkey bread\" if it's not listed on the menu??!!!  It was their responsibility to clarify when they took the order.  Not sure if the owner reads or cares about the reviews online..... Doesn't seem that way..... It's a shame because the pizza was pretty good.  Had they just said \"we'll make this right and bring you the garlic and parmesan in a few\" they would've had a new long-time customer (and we have three kids so pizza is a staple in our home!).  Instead I'll be ordering from the competition next time.  Now I'll be looking for good pizza AND good service from another place because I'm sure not going to find it here.",

    "text": "I've been to Ralph three times over the past few years, and I don't think I'll be going back again.  Bottom line: this place is overpriced.  Case in point in the tomato and mozzarella appetizer.  It's $9.75.  I understand that appetizers and desserts are the place to mark-up prices, and that's fine. These people run a business to make money.  However, I cannot respect a restaurant that gouges its customers.  This particular appetizer is one tomato cut up (prob cost them 50 cents), a few small mozzarella balls, and then a drizzle of balsamic vinaigrette.  A dish that costs them $2-$3 to make should not be priced at $9.75.  Similarly, a bottle of beer, Stella, cost $7.  Furthermore, the menu prices on their website are out of date and misleading.  Another case in point: the veal saltimbocca.  On the website, it's listed as $23.  In the restaurant, however, its $25.  This is one of my favorite dishes because of the prosciutto that is traditionally supposed to cover the veal cutlet.  At Ralph's, there were three tiny bites of prosciutto.  I honestly don't think I was even given one full slice, let alone enough to cover the veal.    I think Ralph's offers traditional Italian food in a great atmosphere.  However, in a city like Philadelphia where Italian restaurants are a dime a dozen, Ralph's has to do much more to make it worth your while.  The food isn't bad, but it's not great either.  On top of serving lackluster food, they have the nerve to charge an arm and a leg for it.  I can think of at least two other Italian restaurants in the city where the food is better AND cheaper.  Ralph's is the perfect example of a once-great restaurant that is now resting on its laurels and relying on name only.  Try it out if you must, but don't expect to be wowed.",

Not a big deal for anyone who can read French and/or has been living in Louisiana for a reasonable amount of time, but definitely something tourists should be wary of. I didn't have any alcohol because I was the designated driver, but I can say that their drink menu is extensive, and the bar was packed from the moment we arrived until the moment we left.   This restaurant's biggest strength is it's food. I tasted their crab bisque, and had Poulet Grand-M\u00e8re as my entr\u00e9e. Both were excellent. The latter arrived in a wide cast-iron bowl, which I'm sure has a more proper name, but was an interesting touch nonetheless.  The service was why I gave this restaurant 4/5 instead of 5/5. Most of the wait staff seemed to be interns from culinary school. The handful we dealt with were very friendly, but would do well to be a little more attentive. For example, the server who brought us our desserts ran off before we could ask for spoons to eat the dessert with.

Anyway, we stumbled across this little gem while we were wandering around the French Quarter, trying to figure out what we wanted to eat.  The atmosphere is wonderful - the Cafe sits at the back of an open courtyard, with tables (some under a patio), and on Friday night, there were musicians playing jazz.  The music carried well, without being so loud we couldn't carry on a conversation.  I believe if you went up the stairs, there was a bar up there (although, probably another establishment).  I'm tempted to give this place five stars for the atmosphere alone, but a restaurant is more than atmosphere.  It was a wonderful way to spend a Friday evening.  Other than the beignet, the food was fine.  It was nothing spectacular, but I got a pretty good club, and my fiance got a pretty good roast beef po'boy.  My bread was a little stale - it happens.  It seemed like we had to wait an awfully long time for the beignet to come out.  I know they're fried fresh, but I've also made them before, and I know it doesn't take 15 minutes.

When arriving right on time for our 6:30 reservation on Friday 07/17/15 the hostess had this mean face. I informed her that we had a reservation and provided her the information. In a not so friendly tone she asked me if everyone was present. We informed her no, but they were on their way. The door to the restaurant is one of those spiral hotel lobby doors. My dad didn't know how to get the stroller inside. The male hostess walked to the door and was informing my father to go around. When I saw they were here, I walked up to the mean women and informed her my party was complete. She watched with an even uglier face on as my father walked in with the stroller. She ignored me as she was watching him and I repeated twice that my party was complete. She finally decided to talk to me and informed me that the stroller cannot go by our table. I then replied that I specifically informed the receptionist about the baby. At that moment the hostess raised her hand to my face to tell me to stop. I was shocked and wanted to hit her hand out of my face. However, being in a nice place I kept it in and just walked away. The male hostess sat us at a table that had booth seating. He pulled the table out for some of us to slide in and he walked away! So the rest of the party pushed the table back.

Food:    Me - LGBT Burger - Goat cheese, bacon.   My son - Daves Smoked - Cold smoked patty, fontina cheese caramelized onions  the BF - Ozark - mushrooms, black peppered goat cheese caramelized onions  My son's friend - The Basic - basic burger - +$1 for cheese  All of the burgers were EXCELLENT.  I can only speak for myself, so first of all, all of our food came out HOT, the buns are made in-house and were delicious.  super tasty, nicely toasted and crispy yet soft - i wanted to take some home with me.  The combination of the goat cheese and bacon with the burger was perfect.  I loved it.  It did not need anything else.  I did put some of the chipotle sauce that came with our fries (separate purchase) and it was pretty good, but not necessary.  Burgers were a pretty good size - they were smaller than the bun, but still a good size.  Worth the price?  Sure, this was a quality burger!  My only gripe, however is that the price did not include fries (see below).  No one left a morsel on their plates.  My son's friend ate so fast we actually thought he was a little strange...no one should eat that fast...  Sides:  We ordered two large french fries ($4 each) to share between four people and it was exactly enough.  You have a choice of \"sauces.\"   I was not impressed at all - they were just fries, and honestly with burgers starting at about $8 these fries should come with the burgers.  I need to have french fries with my burger, so I will pay every time, but suggest that they re-think this item and make them worth the price and at least make something worth the price like  garlic fries.  These are NOT worth the extra $2-$4.  We also had the Cheese Curds - ok not what I was expecting but it was good.  Not sure what kind of cheese it was but it went really well with the mustard and apples - the bread/crackers however were a nightmare almost funny - they crumbled because they were so thin!  Almost like lace.  They really should be a little thicker.  Again, it was good, but c'mon please be a little more generous with the thickness of the bread/cracker.    The boys had ice cream, but I won't comment because I did not taste it.  I was too full from the burger.  Hope to on the next trip.    Overall, we had a great time.

I must admit, I've never spent that much on a cake that size, but the raves that were received and interest in where it came from were proof enough (if not the crumbs in the box) to affirm my decision was a stellar one.  My boss also mentioned he'd never had a cake as delicious!  I'll be sure to bring this up when it's time for my review.",

The crispy tofu was too mushy on the inside. The Beef and Tendon soup was very aromatic, which tricked me. Once I tasted it, it was completely lacking in flavor. It tasted like generic beef broth with some star anise thrown in.  They did have good service and the place was pretty clean. They have a TV to watch games and some people were studying there.  The boba drinks weren't bad. They have all the common flavors. Started at $3.75 for a small, add 50 cents for boba and add 50 cents to make it a large. I think $4.75 is pretty expensive for blended ice and powdered flavoring with a little boba thrown in.",

I'd even rather have spent $19 for a whole sheetcake from Costco...at least their buttercream icing and cake have by far more flavor! Hopefully, the cake quality improves to mach the decor.

    "text": "This review is based off of one visit as I don't think I will be returning anytime soon.   I was attending a Christmas get together at Besito with a large group of about 16. I ordered a \"frozen\" margarita. It was the only frozen margarita on the menu and was pomegranate. It was okay, but a little off for my tastes. It was also melted and no longer frozen within a few minutes of it arriving. I only finished about half of it. We ordered during happy hour when the margarita is supposed to be $5 instead of the usual $9. We had to ask for the happy hour price, but more on that in a moment.   Three of us decided to split a queso fundito. This is one of my favorite Mexican Appetizers and I order it regularly at traditional Mexican restaurants. While the queso fundito was still good at Besito, it was disappointing to someone that has had a traditional version. It is supposed to be essentially a fondue type pot of melted cheese with some chorizo and served with tortillas. Besito cheapened theirs by adding piles of onions and peppers. It was also served in a very shallow square skillet. When split three ways (and with the 2-3 others in the room that tried it), it left very little queso fundito. The flavor was good. However, with the added thick peppers and onions and the small quantity, I would not order again.   I was able to try the chips, salsa and table side guacamole also. I will say that this is probably the best guacamole that I have ever tried. I loved the flavor and the thick chunks of avocado. The salsa and guac were my favorite things at Besito. However, I can't see myself paying $10 for guac on a return visit. That is just way too much for guacamole in my opinion.   For my meal, I ordered the Chile Rellenos Con Hongos. I order Rellenos anytime I see them on the menu since they are one of my favorite things. Most restaurants serve them with some rice and beans or some sort of side. Let's face it...stuffed relleno peppers are not the most filling thing in the world. My Rellenos did not come with a side. The came with sauce and nothing else for a whopping $18. I almost didn't order them when I saw the price, but everything else on the menu was that price or higher. The Rellenos had good flavor for the first bite...or maybe two. However, a few bites in I was over it. They are stuffed in goat cheese and there are globs of goat cheese on the outside. So much freaking goat cheese. I like the stuff, but it was overboard. That wasn't the worst part though, it was the pine nuts. There seemed to be a whole bag of the things mixed into my small plate. I would never order this again.   Our service was great until it came time for the checks. Our waitress did not give us happy hour prices for the margaritas we ordered before happy hour was up. She also messed up dividing our appetizer between the three checks. However, the worst was that we handed the checks to them with our cards in each individual envelope. When they returned, my card was with my friends check (and had been charged) and my check was missing. WTH? It ended up taking us about 45 minutes to get our checks, get them corrected, get them corrected again and get out of there. My poor husband had dropped me off and was waiting outside this whole time since I thought I was almost done when I received the check. Uggg.   I don't think I will be back to Besito anytime soon. If I do, it will be for happy hour only. It is too rich and not on par enough for this cheap, but picky girl.",

Meal Two: The Appz was the Potted Pig, and the Flash Fried Brussels Sprouts. The potted pig was plated creatively having to use a spoon to dive into the pork (texture of a country pate) and then add your toppings from the pickled selections of veggies they gave you either on a cracker or bread.  It was good.... BUT  If you REALLY want a surprising treat, get the Flash Fried Brussels Sprouts! Holy YUM. If Brussels Spouts could ever be considered candy.... you found it here.  They flash fry them and put them in a dish with onions, almonds and bacon! What a TREAT!   I chose (after tasting my buddies last visit) the Pork Chop. And I remembered correctly, it was fantastic! The pork was perfectly seasoned and cooked and they put it over a bed of  sweet potatoes and topped it with apple slaw. So many flavors that melded together perfectly! and YES I ate my entire plate!  Dessert we each got one and shared - table of four here-just for reference ;) We got the S'mores pudding. They topped with semi burned marshmallows. Holy yum. and the pudding  was topped with candied pecans.  I can not recall the name of the dessert our friends got, but we tried it and it was good as well!

I've been to the Capital Grill and I enjoy their beef as well as their service and decor, I just didn't want to spend $250.00 + for the 3 of us (call me cheap).  Not really knowing what to expect at the Marmont, we took a risk.    The Good: I have to say that the NY strip steaks and rib eye were very very good and cooked perfectly (medium rare and medium).  They were about 1-1/2 thick (forgot to bring my calipers) and well trimmed; very little fat was left. I would say the meat was prime, not choice.  We all enjoyed them as well as the fries which were cooked crisply as we requested.  the sauces were meh; why cover up the wonderful taste of the beef?  Service was good, prompt, and polite.     The Not So Good: The decor is awful.  The floor looks like painted OSB with the paint half worn off, the tables are painted plywood, lighting from K-Mart, and walls have a few giant old signs hanging on them.  The place is a visual dive. I felt like I was in a Tom Waits song.  How hard would it be to make it a nice warm and inviting space? I don't get it.   Want to make more money? Spend the 5K, it will pay off. But please find someone who knows what they are doing.  You serve delicious steaks; I'll bet your decorator doesn't do the cooking, so why ask the cook to decorate?  If you want great steaks for a good price, go here.  But if you are looking for a classy or trendy setting too, you may need to pay the extra 30% at a high end steak house.",

This trip we chose Mr. B's over Commander's Palace because we were going to be in the French Quarter for Dirty Linen Night.  First time at Mr. B's.    The first indication of trouble came from the attitude of the hostess when our party of 6 arrived.  Just a \"come with me\".    Our server was adequate but not particularly well-trained. We were not made to feel particularly welcome.   Our drinks took 20 minutes to arrive.  After 40 minutes, we had to ask for bread.  While I enjoy lingering over drinks and a meal, the 2 1/2 hours required for our meal was too much.  And although I understand the concept of a team of servers, after about 1 1/2 hours our original server vanished without a word, handing us over to others .  I must say that the last server of the evening was really wonderful.  The food was good.  But the inattentive and indifferent treatment at the hands of the hostess and our original server put a damper on the meal.  Really, there are too many wonderful restaurants in New Orleans to put up with this one.  We will not be returning.",

We were maybe one of the first patrons in the restaurant upon opening.  The ambiance is lovely.  We were greeted warmly initially, and the warmness continued throughout our visit.  As I said prior, the ambiance is lovely, the decor is SO just want to take it home.  The service was impeccable, our waitress was attentive, friendly, knowledgeable, and smiley.  OMG. The food.

Really, really good! The other 2 were not, and I only ate 1 piece of each. My tempura roll has no tempura, but the real problem was the seaweed wrappers were so strong and overbearing I could not enjoy the flavor of the fish.  I later realized there was a board of specials and wishes I had ordered off of it. They had some rolls that sounded wonderful.  A bigger issue for me was the service. I was never given water. I was asked to move to make soave for a larger group (this is fine, happy to do it) and while I didn't mind at all, I was never given a dish for my soy sauce in my new seat. I ended up using the serving tray. These are minor inconveniences but could have been resolved if someone had checked in even once to see what I needed. I didn't even have the option to order more food if I had wanted it.  I left hungry and disappointed.",

We were seated in the corner for two people, however, we thought that the table was kind of small for us.  We ordered the mussels ($14) as our appetizers. Good thing, we finished the appetizer first before our entrees came because you couldn't have fit 3 plates on that table. The mussels were okay.. We definitely had better. I guess, we were a little disappointed that the mussels weren't bigger since they should be in season? I mean, the Italian market is like right there... and they sell a lot of fresh seafood there. Anyways, as my entree, I decided on the seafood pescatore ($26) and my bf got the chicken alfredo ($19). I felt that my dish wasn't as great. There was good amount of seafood but the sauce was a little off for me. My bf's dish was mediocre at best. It didn't look that appetizing nor did it taste that great. It was really bland and we added salt and pepper so that it could taste a little better.   Honestly, we were sort of disappointed since a friend did recommend this place. It could be that our friend has bad taste or it could be, what we ordered? We decided to skip desserts since we weren't really satisfied with our meals. I'm glad that we had a groupon because we were not happy with our meal. We don't mind paying the price for good food but we felt that it wasn't worth it here.

    "text": "So we know we have many options out there when it comes to dining out. So tonight the kids wanted steak. We are from out of town, here for part business and part pleasure.  Called ahead seating, time was about 20-30mins, perfect, no problem. We arrived and waited for maybe 5 mins in the lobby. So far so good. There was 5 of us, so they put us in a booth that fits 4 ppl, and added a chair at the end. Cool, no big deal. Server, Stefanie came by, took drink order, came back and we were ready to order our food. So we did. She was very tentative, we never had to ask for a refill, not even once. That's good service right there. I will give credit where credit is deserved. So, we all decided on having steak tonight. Two youngest wants steak bites, med cooked, oldest daughter wants hers med rare, my ribeye med, and husbands prime rib medium.  After 30 mins, 8:30 server says she doesn't understand why our food hasn't come out yet she will check, cool. Still no food. Food finally came out steak bites were cold. Matter of fact EVERYTHING WAS COLD. Ok, so food sat in the window. Got someone by the name of Jamie, guest relation guy and told him our food is cold, he apologized and took food to kitchen for recook. He said he would personally see it that they cook it right, HE NEVER RETURN TO OUR TABLE. Time goes by, veru slowly, watching every other table who came in same with us or even after us get their food. So we wait, about 9:25, the remake came out, ran by the SERVICE MANAGER, JODI. This was the first time that she ever came to us. Brought food, had the nerve to ask \" how are you doing\" I replied with angry and hungry, she had no apologies, NOTHING. Food still was not hot, two younger kids food was still well done. I even had Jodi touch the steak bites with her finger, and asked her if it was cold or hot. She said herself that it was cold. I asked her would she have let her kids eat that??? She couldn't answer me. At this point I'm pretty frustrated. She said what would I like for her to do. I SAID, IT WOULD BE NICE TO HAVE THE KITCHEN RECOOK IT STAT, SINCE WE HAVE BEEN WAITING SINCE 8PM. As a service manager or any kind of manager, she should be embarrassed to run the food out without looking at the ticket seeing that it was all supposed to be medium cooked. She could not, would not , do anything to keep me from being so angry, and so disappointed because we have never had a problem with any Texas roadhouse before.  So I told her to take the damn food away, and the kitchen manager AJ came out. I asked her to sit next to me and I explained what was going on to her. She seems to understand , but didnt know what to do. I told her, i want the owners business card, and some kind of compensation for being there almost 2 damn hours and my kids were hungry. They were very patience and to the end, still did not have dinner.  Here's how I would handle the situation. As a sserver I would tell the manager immediately that the food is taking long. Then when food came out make sure manager would come by and check on guests. That never happened. So when food is sent back, manager needs to be aware IMMEDIATELY. And food will be recooked immediately, STAT, and go out to the table and apologize. That was not done at all. Instead she comes out , so unprofessional, and made situation even worse.  So i have NEVER been so angry ever at any restaurants. If i was the owner, I would call the guest back asap, and see how to get the guest back and give their restaurant another chance. I got the business card and did call Mr. Michael (owner) we'll see if he returns the call.  In the end AJ did get an approval from her owner over the phone to give us a certificate to return for two free meals for 2 adults. I wouldn't want to come back unless I get an invite from the owners and on the day they work to ensure that this does not happened again. So again we'll see if they will reach out to their guest concerns.  Ovtall, i wouldnt give this restaurant any stars for the food service, but for the server she was good. She still should have checked on her tables food and made sure it didn't just in the window. But she was busy, i guess I can understand.  Very poor guest relation from service manager Jodi and Jamie never came back to check on us.   In the end, had to go else where at 10pm to get food for kids. I'm still pretty upset and frustrated with this restaurant.   You have many options when dining out, please do not go here.....EVER. CHECK RATINGS AND FIND ANOTHER TEXAS ROADHOUSE.",

This is really the best pizza I've ever had. The crust is thin, crispy yet has a nice chew, and flavorful.  Last night I had a dinner special of chicken cutlet in a lobster, white -truffle oil, light cream sauce with asparagus, shallots and sundried tomatoes over angel hair pasta. On the Special's menu it is listed as a veal entree, but the kitchen was more than happy to substitute Chicken for me. The dish was so delicately seasoned with such a fine touch that I enjoyed smelling it almost as much as tasting it. In addition, it was such a generous portion that I enjoyed it two nights later for dinner and now want to go back tomorrow and order it again!!  What an absolutely fabulous recipe. Very fine, subtle flavor but also comforting and satisfying.

We had the email with the confirmation so went back to the register to ask about it. Again, the manager was very rude and just said \"what does your groupon say- it says you have to have a reservation\" and walked away again. So, yes, the fine print said reservations required, but this is not the type of place I can see anyone making a reservation, and they never mentioned that until they couldn't find it in the system.

When I tasted the stuffing it was barely warm and the lobster meat was a bit dry and not as hot as it should have been. Seem like left over lobster reheated. There was really no reason why the dish was not hot enough as there were hardly any other people there at the time that would have caused them to rush the order out. Some restaurants keep the serving plates hot so that the food stays hot longer. I could have sent it back and told them to heat it up but didn't feel like doing that, because to me there really wasn't any reason for it to be served cold.",

Just like the previous poster stated more toast than anything, really not to flavorful.  On my most recent visit I paid $4.51 for my breakfast sandwich, which was totally not worth it. The bacon was over salty and not cripsy, it also appeared that they only give you 1 egg on the sandwich. You can also tell they use cheap American cheese, which everyone knows does not melt that well.  Waste of my money, I was very dissapointed. Will never go here to eat again.",

In a three day period, we somehow managed to experience happy hour, drinks, and brunch. The charcuterie platter was substantial and thoughtfully crafted, the perfect pair to a locally brewed pint. Also recommended: the donuts.  Brunch menu items range from healthy to traditional; the potatoes are delicious. Note that the bloody marys are chock full of horseradish--I enjoy a spicy bloody, but we had to order extra tomato juice to balance the flavor.

When we pointed out the confusion, in a very understanding way (really making sure that she knew that we totally see how the confusion had occurred). This lady got angry! Left me speaking half way through and gave me her back, she came back with another thing of regular coffee, and started to bang our silverware on the table with a face of complete discontent.   She didn't provide a straw for a tea, and there was another waitress near by. Not wanting to upset our waitress even more my brother's fiancee asked this other waitress for a straw. She looked at her also with an attitude, and she said: both of my hands are full, can't you see!   Full disclosure: both of these waitresses were African American and my family is hispanic. I don't know if there's some sort of racial issue in New Orleans between these two races, but it just seemed that there was a lot of aggression for things that are pretty normal at a restaurant.   We said we wanted to leave and asked for the check and the manager. The manager came, and asked us what the situation was. Our waitress had these threatening eyes on us the entire time, and the manager asked her to step aside, at which point the waitress started raising her voice. We said to the manager: \"this attitude is precisely why we want to pay and leave now and handed her $20dlls without looking at the bill (but we had asked for 2 coffees, 1 tea, water, and 2 diet cokes, a lot less than $20). I was expecting for an apology and to let us go without pay since we had barely touched our drinks. However, she took our $20dlls. and left the table. All the while three people with long hair peaked from the kitchen staring us also in a very threatening way. It was actually very scary.

I wasn't looking for any type of discount or freebie, all i wanted to do was give a feedback to the manager so he knows they should be more careful since this wasn't the first time they \"miscounted\" (in the past I've been shorted on wings and shrimps) tonight is the last time I'm ever eating/drinking here and i will no longer be recommending people to come here.",

Our waitress was pleasant but detached, no interest in boosting our experience or displaying a personality, the smile and pleasantries seemed forced.  We ordered 2 appetizers: onion rings and nachos.  They were served pretty quickly but we were not provided with plates, which made for a messier experience than it should have.  Curiously, the check noted \"no plates\" for the apps and we were perplexed by this.   The entrees were just okay. Nobody was thrilled but it was all edible.  The burrito came with chips and salsa, according to the menu, but no salsa was served. When questioned,  the waitress said the salsa was inside the burrito.  Oh, okay a pile of chips but nothing to dip them in.  We asked for boxes for leftovers which were provided, but no bag for carrying them.  All told, we had enough to eat but once we left we had to laugh because we had ALL wanted to leave when we were seated but nobody spoke up. Generally disappointed, in large part because we all liked the outside look of the venue but the experience didn't deliver.",

We also lucked out because the people next to us had thoughtfully brought more tequila than they needed and let us have a few glasses of the BYOT margaritas. The mixes were fresh and flavorful and they will mix the tequila in for you.

    "text": "I absolutely love acai bowls so I had to stop in when visiting from Seattle.  On a Sunday around 11, all the seats were taken and there was a small line. I only had to wait 5 to 10 minutes to receive my bowl, which I think is reasonable.   I ordered the Backyard Bowl (which only comes in the large size for some reason... why?). This acai bowl includes a base made of acai, banana, strawberries, and hemp milk. The bowl is topped with sliced banana, chopped strawberries, blueberries, goji berries, bee pollen and granola, plus a honey drizzle if you want. It's already sweet enough so the honey isn't necessary. I added peanut butter to mine for a protein kick and more flavor. I enjoyed the bowl itself, although it takes some work to get down to the actual acai base in the to-go cup. I would have liked a few more berries too. The granola itself is kind of meh... not bad but not great. For the price ($13 to $14 after tax and tip) I think the bowl should have been a little better. Again, don't get me wrong, it was good overall. If you're hungry and can put away a decent amount of food, you should be able to finish the large. Next time I would omit the goji berries because I'm not a huge fan of the flavor but wanted to give them another shot.  Everyone working there was pleasant, but service wasn't spectacular. I don't care too much about that as long as I don't have to wait forever for my food to be ready. The place itself could have been a little cleaner... it wasn't super messy but there were strawberry butts scattered on the floor near the chopping station and the fruity smell in the air seemed a little stale. (That's just me being super picky and an OCD clean-freak... it's probably totally acceptable based on normal people standards).  Overall, I wouldn't be opposed to coming here again in the future. I might try the pb&j quinoa bowl because that sounds amazing! Nothing beats the acai bowls in Kirkland, WA though.",

I had to come here as soon as it opened to grab some coffee and sample their daily selection of donuts before my seminar started in the morning.   New Orleans is known for the buttermilk drop and while I didn't get a chance to try the one at Wink's in the French Quarter, I imagine the ones at District are a good representation. It's a cakey donut hole with sweet icing draped over it. Generally, I'm more a yeast donut fan but those buttermilk drops were delightful. I could have eaten a half dozen, no sweat. But there were other items to try.   District has \"croquenuts\" available which is their version of a griddled donut sandwich. I chose the \"Monte Cristo\" for it's sweet and savory combination. Gooey cheese and salty ham between a donut covered in powdered sugar with a hefty dollop of raspbery preserves nestled in the center of the donut. This was a magical creation. Get it if you have the chance.  Finally, to top of my donut extravaganza, I chose the Miso Olive Oil Praline Bacon donut. It's a mouthful to say but wasn't to consume. Such a fascination combination of flavors from this donut. I chose it mostly for the bacon but the miso, olive oil, and praline each hit their notes with every bite. Simply wonderful.   Not to forget was the the Vietnamese Iced Coffee to wash it all down. It was the jolt I needed to wake me up for this early morning call for donuts.   You bet I'll make another (or several) stops next time I'm in New Orleans.",

I got the Bloody Mary and it was a great size for the price. It was spicy and hit the spot. They text message you when your table is ready, so were able to walk around the quarter while we waited. Thank god a lot of restaurants are getting rid of the those buzzers that make you feel like you are under house arrest.  We sat down to a beautiful table right by the open shutters. The servers, were ok. They were busy, but forgot a couple of things we asked for. It was still a great experience though! I got the pork chop with red beans and the turtle soup. The turtle soup was one of the best I have had. The pork chop was cooked to perfection and the read beans were seasoned very well. It came with cornbread, but it was very dry. After this lunch at noon, I didn't find myself hungry till it was basically time for bed. It was a very generous portion and well worth the money.  Muriel's is a great way to get a classic, good quality New Orleans meal at a decent price. The location is spectacular, and the history behind the restaurant made for great conversation at the table.

And the peanut butter shake was amazing.  I did try some of my husband's food and I guess that's partially why I only am giving Bailey's Range 3 stars. He ordered honey mustard sauce with his fries, and there was nothing \"honey\" flavored about it; it just tasted like spicy mustard to me, which neither of us particularly care for.  I won't even get started on the bacon milkshake he ordered and didn't care for, because that's his own fault for ordering something so strange.  In short, I wasn't all that impressed.

Smiley and Mrs. Smiley go out of their way to make sure you are charmed and satisfied, whether that's sending over free baklava or extra smoothies so that everyone can have a try.  I'm happy to say I'm a Smiley's regular, and will sing their praises to whoever will listen.",

I'm going to give the place the benefit of the doubt that it is not always like this as we came in at 10 PM, but if you cannot offer quality food at that hour then don't have your kitchen open.  All of our food came out within 5 to 10 minutes of ordering which leads me to believe it was not made fresh. The Caesar salad was room temperature and overdressed. The hush puppies were flavorless, and the chicken wings (3 full wings is a serving) were undercooked and barely warm. The only redeeming food item was the chicken and biscuits, which had a nice flavor profile- the biscuit was again, cold in spots.   On the positive side the place has a nice hip atmosphere and the service is friendly.   Unfortunately, the food was so sub par we would not consider dining here again.",

The deli is borderline awful and they do a spectacular job of having all of the gristle and fat hidden in the pre-sliced lunchmeat, you figure that out when you get home and you have enough real meat to make a half a sandwich and enough byproduct to feed your cat for several days. Also be sure to check the expiration date on dairy before you buy as I have gotten milk and yogurt home several times to find it days or weeks out of date.  The weirdest part about this place is the cast of derelicts that loiter there daily yet are not escorted off the premises.

By 7pm, though we were still talking, the waitress still hadn't checked on us, when we would try to get her attention, she never did seem to make eye contact with us, she simply ghosted to the back areas of the eatery.   At 7:15 we had to verbally signal her to get us boxes, and to ask for the check. She then didn't remember them for another spate of time, we finally got out of the establishment at 7:44.

First, we asked what were the choices for the \"entree + two sides options,\" on the menu and she started listing the sides. I asked her if there was a menu to read what the sides are, and she said that was the list. Ok. Before we could ask anything else she drifted off somewhere else and we had to bring her back. Basically, you're kinda forced to get the buffet option because if she get the entree you're limited to what you can get even though other food choices are available on the buffet. Bright side, if you go with the buffet you will get a chance to sample some of their popular items.  Moving on, we got our tea which was PHENOMENAL. I'd say crack tea because it was hard to just NOT keep drinking it. Aside from that, I got the fried chicken, green beans, gumbo and stuffed bell peppers. You also get the choice of an omelette or french toast-tried the French toast as well. Once we got our drinks and started eating- Ol Marie went missing for awhile. We needed refills, napkins, and clearing our table of empty plates,  but she was nowhere to be found. Other waiters had to step in to clear our table. We were getting ready to leave but wanted more tea, so we asked if we could get a refill,and she just walked off without acknowledging if she heard us or not. We also wanted to know if we could get it to go. Then all of a sudden she reapppeared pouring tea which she sloppily wasted on the table and my purse-no words or apology. I told her we were trying to inform her that we wanted them to go AND the bill split, but yet again she walked off without acknowledging if she heard everything. She returned with plastic cups. The cups were dusty to the point you could wipe your finger over and see the residue- no thank you. Marie also brought back the bill without it being split as we asked. When we reminded her of our request, she rudely Replied \"we dont split checks but you could simply divide it.\" Boyyy it took everything in me not to go off. I told her \"we're fully aware of how to do math, however we asked for separate bills in which you never told us that it was a policy to not separate the tab.\" AT this point the owner nearby could see our frustration and his as well, in which he told her \"all you have to is seperate it out, no big deal.\" This was too confusing for Ms. Marie, in which the owner had to further explain. Eventually she just took three seperate payments. smh.  Overall, the food and experience was \"OK.\" I had to add some salt and pepper to some of my food, which is a red flag considering it seems to be a well known NOLA spot. Honestly, the fried chicken from Willie's was waaaay better. Can't say I'd return, but I can cross this off my list.",

There was almost no one in there and I had my hands full of stuff and she told me, very rudely, that I could not set down my items at the cashier area for a moment. I had four water bottles, so it did take up that much space. There was a sign there that said not to place items there, but I didn't see it as I had dark sunglasses on. All I had to do was pick up my chicken salad at the other area, which was already ordered, and walk right back over. There were two other customers in there, that's it, and plenty of room on the counter. I had tried to place my stuff way out of the way too. Any other customer would have had the entire counter space, but for my little corner at the opposite end, blocked by some cheese crackers anyway. It's just that she was so rude about it. I was in there awhile ago too, and same woman (Zoey) and same rudeness, only the last time I was in there there was no sign and no other customers. She's an middle-aged/ older woman (50's) with blonde hair, average build, raspy voice. There was just no reason she can't be polite. I was super nice and asked if I could set my water there quickly. I just hasn't seen the sign, but still... why be so rude? I think they should find someone else.   The food is good, however. But I will now find someplace else to go when I'm in the area.",

No thank you! The rice and beans were a saving grace.   It's a pretty large venue and I see it being great for large groups. They play super awesome music and have a great bartender and cocktails.

Our order was taken right away and in a friendly manner. The food seemed to take several minutes, but was hot and fresh and worth the wait. It was my first time trying the new veggie sliders. They aren't THE best veggie burgers I have ever had, and are quite high in calories from what I hear, but were good. I appreciate that White Castle started offering these for the cravers that no longer do meat.  The only small disappointment was that when we were asked if we wanted sauce, what kind of sauce I do not know, I requested mustard on my sliders and that was left off. There also were no napkins or salt in the bag. It was hard to tell my veggie slider from my aunt's fish sandwich digging in the bag in the car. The large portions on our medium fries made up for it though as well as being a quick and convenient place for someone like me to grab a meal on the run that contained some much needed protein.  Service was friendly and the restaurant seemed clean. It appears to be either a newer store or a very well-kept one. Bonus was seeing one of the Indy chicken limos down the road.  Updating to say, while good tasting, the food I had did not sit quite right with me.  It was possibly that I'm not used to greasy combined with being out of sorts lately.

So I was on my way through Nashville while on a trip to Texas from Maine with my girlfriend and decided to stay in Nashville for the night. We stopped by this restaurant and started off with some drinks which were both fantastic beers that were recommended by our waitress. We then ordered our burgers, I ordered the chili-chili bang bang and the Benton's bacon mac and cheese and my girlfriend got the buy the farm and truffle tots. Now here's where things got interesting and the reason why this place gets a 5 instead of 4 from me...... I got my food (which was cooked perfectly and had plenty of flavor) and my girlfriend took a bite into her burger and pulled out what appeared to be plastic from it. We politely told our waitress and she took the burger right back and had them make a new one for us. The manager (I believe, it may have been the chef) comes out and apologized and you could tell he was very remorseful and that this is not a regular occurrence. He explained that the wax surrounding the cheese must not have come off and fixed the burger immediately and triple checked everything again. He even came out with two extra sides of tots and quickly brought her burger back. Then to top off this already incredibly generous gesture, they comped her entire meal for us (which they didn't have to do, for after that level of service I would've been glad to pay full price). We made sure that we still tipped over 20% of the original price of the meal before some of the food was comped for the excellent service. I went in to try and shake that gentleman's hand but he had gone out back right as I was leaving. I would recommend this place to anyone of my friends who are traveling to Nashville, and I will definitely make a repeat trip the next time I'm here",

The 3 foot by 5 foot freezer contained - frozen coconut shrimp, cheap - freezer burnt swai, bags of 3 stuffed clams and a couple of lobster pot pies - that by the way were offered to us for FREE if we decided to take any of this garbage off their hands!

Certainly not the best I've ever had but good enough. The to go packaging was a bit overkill just for that one slice of cake, as was the $10 price tag. That being said, I'm sure the \"fanciness\" of the place is what makes it so appealing to folks. It really is quite unique and cute for our area and would be a good place to go with the gals (rather than my husband who hates all things trendy, lol).   My problem, though, was with the service. We placed our order for the carrot cake with a nice young teenager, and then waited. And waited. I could see the carrot cake just sitting in the pretty covered cake stand, and I felt really tempted to just slice it myself. After a bit (felt like 10 minutes, although I'm sure it was more like 5 or 6), another employee came and sliced the carrot cake, setting the slice on the back counter with the ticket. And then we waited. And waited some more. After about another 5 to 10 minutes, I flagged the teenager down and asked if he could box up the cake for us. He seemed confused, and it took an awkward minute-long exchange for him to understand we hadn't yet received our order. He did apologize for the wait, which I do appreciate, boxed up the cake, and then we were on our way.  I should clarify that we did not go into the shop at a busy time. It was a relatively cool day and not many people were out. While there were maybe 2 to 3 tables seated, we were the only ones at the counter ordering. And while I'm sure the wait staff who repeatedly walked by our lonely piece of carrot cake sitting on the back counter had many important tasks...I just wanted to eat my $10 cake.  Four stars for the cake. Two stars for the service.",

First time was one of the best meals I've had in a while, but the second was the most disappointing meal I've had in New Orleans.    To start, getting a table for 5 on a Saturday at 8:30PM was pretty miserable.  We were told to \"check back every 10 minutes\" for a starting 45 minute wait.  After 45 minutes, we were told to \"check back every 5 minutes.\"  Really?  Fine, food was awesome, we'll play your game (the live music venue beside them is awesome).    We finally were seated, and ordered food.  It wasn't all bad, but it was definitely inconsistent and average at best.  Smoked salmon ravioli was completely saturated with dill, to the point of being one-note.  The gnocchetti sounded great on paper, but they forgot to put the panchetta, rendering the plate completely flavorless due to the lack of salt.  The duck in the duck pasta was completely overcooked to the point of nearly duck jerky.  The devils on horseback were soggy and overdone.    A few standouts though were the sliders and the deviled eggs, and the cocktails were delicious.  Maybe their chef was in the weeds or they had the B-squad in on a saturday night.  Either way, unfortunately I won't be going back after this one.  a 5* and a 2* experience don't lend me to trying for the \"3rd time's a charm\" experience.  sigh.",

    "text": "- Did Not Meet My Expectations - Two of my daughters and I treated my mother to lunch on the patio at Upland yesterday. My mother is hearing impaired so we try to choose locations on the quieter side to enhance her dining experiences. We also checked the menu online first to ensure a variety of salad choices as that is my mother's go-to menu item. My middle daughter and I visited Upland for a beverage just a couple of weeks prior; it was a Sunday afternoon and the patio was delightful and quiet. Unfortunately, this visit was anything but quiet or delightful.  Upon arrival were seated on the patio -- there were other tables occupied with ladies having lunch (looked close to my age), young parents with a baby, and others. That said, I was confused by the rock music blaring from the patio speakers. I tried to let it go, but after 10 minutes had gone by and we're still challenged trying to have conversations at our table, I went inside and asked the bartender (only staff member I could find) to please turn down the patio music as it was difficult for us to hear our own conversations. He seemed agreeable, but I seriously doubt the music was modified; if it was, it was marginal at best. It's not like I'm not a fan of Def Leppard, but I don't want to hear it blaring at a group lunch. As we perused the menu before ordering, we noticed it was very different than the menu Upland has posted online for lunch. Far fewer salad choices, fewer dressing choices, and fewer vegan options (all of my daughters are vegans). Mother and I both chose the Bibb salad; apparently, it's a new salad offering with large, leafy greens, strawberries, candied pecans and blue cheese crumbles for approximately $11.00. When my salad arrived, it was a shallow salad bowl with lots of large salad leaves and a meager amount of the other ingredients. Fortunately, my mother's salad had a few more ingredients in hers and she seemed to enjoy it, so I was pleased with that. We did both enjoy the salad dressings we chose; there are only 3 offered so not a lot of options. While we were still eating our lunch, our server asks if it will all be on one check and then before we were done eating, casually dropped off the bill to me. I really do not appreciate it when my bill is dropped off before completing a meal and also before having the dishes cleared from our table. Am I being rushed to pay the bill, and if so, why? As a customer, I don't appreciate feeling rushed by servers. Yes, pet peeve of mine.  I should also mention that I tried ordering the advertised Monday drink special, Helios Pale, but was told they were out of it.  Will I return? Would likely only do so to pick up a carry out order of the Buffalo Chili as it is a favorite of my husband's.  Will my 20-something daughters return? Perhaps for a beer, but not for food as Upland now has very limited vegan options.",

I am writing this review even before I head to the restaurant for dinner tonight and believe me when I say this, that I would never end up eating here if the majority of the birthday girl's party did not insist on eating at Han Dynasty just because she likes the food.\u00a0   It takes 2 phone calls and talking to 3 people to get a reservation at this restaurant, that itself is a turn off. The first lady I speak to is flat out rude when I call asking to make a dinner reservation for tonight \"We're all booked for tonight and not giving out any reservations\" she says before hanging up on me. I call back and a second lady answers and I say I need a reservation for 15 people at 9:30 and she asks for how long? WTF??? \"For however long it takes 15 adults to get done with dinner that's how long\" She responds saying they close at 10PM and the lady has no clue what day it is and they are open later on Friday's and finally agrees to give me a reservation.\u00a0   It is absolutely appalling when people working in the hospitality industry are rude. If you can't be courteous to your guests consider a different profession. I understand you are in the university city area and have to, more often that you like, deal with students but that by no means is an excuse for ill-treating your guests.\u00a0   If you expect a 20% tip from anyone they expect to be given a good experience right from the time they call you to make a reservation.",

I asked if I could pay additional to have it made with BBQ sauce, but once again told it was not possible.   Sadly, we left the restaurant and chose a different nearby restaurant for lunch.

Another couple even commented to us that they felt uncomfortable to talk in the restaurant.  My husbands peppercorn steak was literally all peppercorns. He ended up needing to scrape off the sauce to eat any part of the meal. My crab ravioli was a confusing combination of flavors that ended up only tasting of the vegetables surrounding the ravioli plate.

    "text": "Marrakesh is a total package dining experience. Not only do you get to eat authentic Moroccan cuisine, you get to enjoy a cultural experience as well.   You may have walked past Marrakesh or the surrounding streets many times without even realizing it was there, like I had prior to this visit. It's nestled on Leithgow Street just a notch off of South Street. Forget South Street or even the rest of Philadelphia for that matter. You are about to step into a different world. To enter you must ring the doorbell on the side door.   I felt more like I was going to a house, than a restaurant; especially with the shower located in the restroom on the second floor. During my entire visit, I never felt like I was at a restaurant. I felt comfortable and relaxed. Maybe eating with your hands with a towel on your lap has that effect.   I found my group of fellow Yelpers in a cozy private room.  The room had four tables with booth seating along the outskirts of the room. Ottoman like chairs took up the rest of the space for the rest of us. With such a large group in not the largest of spaces, it got loud.  Our meal started with customary hand-washing and we were even entertained twice with a belly dancer. After placing our order, the food kept flowing. The service was probably the most unobtrusive service I've ever had. As one dish was placed in front of us, another was seamlessly removed. I felt like royalty or at least someone enjoying a nice meal at someone's dinner party. The regular dining formalities I'm used to were thrown out the window, and it was fantastic!   As I'm sure you're aware, this $25 prix fixe menu has seven courses and you are welcome to BYOB. While it was a ton of food, I walked in the door absolutely starving and walked out not overly stuffed. I believe most people left absolutely full, so maybe the tip is to come in extremely hungry. Here's a little rundown of dining experience:  Course 1: Three-Salad Platter- The eggplant is phenomenal (and messy). Luckily you have some assistance from the pita to eat it. The cucumbers and bell peppers and carrots and cucumber were good, but the eggplant stole the show.   Course 2: The B'stella- As someone who doesn't normally love sweets but loves cinnamon, carbs and meat, this dish was a winner. This dish was dough filled with chicken, nuts, almonds, egg, peppers and onions. It was really hot at first, but once you cracked open the shell and let it cool down, it was easier to eat. I had some pita saved from the first course, so I found it easy to break off a piece and rest it on the pita while it cooled down. Truly a sweet-savory delight.   Course 3: Chicken- So here's where the choices began. You can either get chicken with lemon or spicy chicken. My group opted to get the spicy chicken with the cumin sauce on the side. The chicken was melt in your hands and then melt in your mouth good. The spicy sauce had a nice kick without being overly spicy to me. I still had some pita leftover so I did a little dipping with the sauce.   Course 4: Beef or Lamb- My table got a little creative here and asked for half portions of both the beef and lamb. The beef was served shish kebab style, and to be honest, not my favorite. It was a little well done, and I struggled a little to get it off the stick resulting in a pepper flying into my husband's wine glass. Sauvignon blanc tastes best with a little pepper anyways, right? The lamb was perfect. Even the non-lamb eaters thought it was delicious. It was tender and took on the flavor of the chick peas and onions without having an overwhelming lamb flavor.   Course 5: Couscous with veggies, chick peas and raisins- This was probably my least favorite dish from the main meal. It was a little blander than other couscous dishes I've tried in the past. I would have been disappointed if this was the only thing I ordered, but everything was a hit thus far in the evening. They did give us spoons at this point, so don't worry about eating the little grains with your hands.  Courses 6 & 7: Dessert- I'm assuming the tea, fruit and pastries count as the sixth and seventh courses. At this point in the evening, my bottle of wine had been consumed and I wasn't counting the dishes, and am making this assumption while referencing the menu. I'm not a tea fan so I passed. The pastries were little crisp triangles that reminded me of baklava. The fruit came out frozen was a little hard to eat. I nibbled on a strawberry and took a banana for the road since the majority of the group passed on the fruit. Perhaps the fruit was customary, but I thought a little unnecessary. If it's part of the traditional meal then no harm, no foul.    To sum it up, I had delicious food and hours of fun. It's an experience not to be missed in Philadelphia, especially if you go with an adventurous group of friends. While I couldn't imagine going to Marrakesh every Friday night, I can definitely pick a handful of occasions that would be a perfect fit.",

I love the decorations, the old decor, and the little booths with the radio thing.    The menu is slightly overwhelming if you're looking for a delicious alcoholic icecream martini because everything looks so gosh darn good!  After debating for what felt like an hour I finally settled on the Thin Mint martini and boy was it good - a tad strong but YUMTASTIC in my mouth!    Stewart got the Chocolate Covered Almond which also tasted fabulous and the Orange Dreamsicle which I didn't care for.  Then again I don't like orange dreamsicles and this tasted just like one. haha.  Kate got The Great Mississippi Mudslide which was amazing as well and the Love Potion #9.  The love potion one tasted interesting - kinda like a liquid PB&J in your mouth which is an odd sensation but exactly what they were going for.

    "text": "In a direct Bobby Flay vs. Jose Garces match, i.e. comparing Bobby's Burger Palace and Village Whiskey, I'd say BBP clearly wins.  Village Whiskey's biggest weakness is actually its high price. Taste-wise, my medium-rare burger with goat cheese and egg is comparable to BBP or 500 Degrees. The meat and egg were prepared the way I like it, and the toppings were of high quality, especially the cheese. (Note that the egg yolk is runny! If you don't like that or are afraid of salmonella, let them know.) The only thing I did not like as much was how heavily the hamburger buns were buttered. That was just a little bit too much for my taste, but I know many people who would love the slightly sweet, buttery bun. However, the burger I got was 16 dollars (11 for the burger, 3.50 for the cheese and 1.50 for the egg), which is exactly the price of the burger at Craigie on Main. In case you don't frequent Boston as much, Craigie's is a 'real' gourmet burger where French fries and a small salad are included in the price. At VW, we had to order French fries for 5 dollars on the side, which were delicious and came with a well-spiced ketchup.  I like the atmosphere of the place, and the location which made seating outside more pleasant than at BBP's right on Walnut Street. The service also was excellent (very much unlike BBP). The staff appears professional, they are attentive and fill up your water very regularly.  All in all, it's a 3.5 - the good burger, atmosphere and service warrant a high rating, but the extraordinarily high price (for what you get) is rather a downer, and I can't give 4 stars to a place where I am unsure whether I'd want to come back. I do like the concept of letting the customer choose their own toppings, which allowed me to choose a combination of toppings you never see but I personally enjoy. On the other hand, the menu of this place is largely uninspired and boring, which in turn is Bobby's Burger Palace's strongest point. If you are in the area, this is probably the highest quality burger + fries you can get - but it comes at a steep price.",

The two pizzas split among a couple of people were the sausage and the potato with rosemary. They were both tasty but I think they forgot the Rosemary on ours. Still yummy, tho! Another entree was the grouper w/Israeli couscous. Scrumptious!  Dessert was a must and the zeppoles, or sugared donuts, were amazing. The cherry tart a little less so, but one person at our table loved it, so maybe it was just not my cup of tea.

The Smokehouse Lightning cocktail was deeeelicious, for starters. The mac and cheese was intensely rich, though a bit bland, even with the addition of chewy crawfish meat. Lamb sliders were juicy little bites, though I tasted none of the sun-dried cranberry aioli listed on the menu. The \"primal chili\" had a great balance of meat and beans, topped with a bit of melted chocolate and (too much) sea salt.   Service was friendly, attentive and clearly nervous. Had a bit of a mix-up when we paid our check, leaving me a bit salty, but I won't fault them for it here. Shit happens, especially when you're a nervous new server.  Maybe I'm being nitpicky, but all restaurants have to grow to really make it. I have high hopes for Twisted Tail, though, and am really glad they're in our 'hood. Give it a few months and I'm certain things will even out.",

Their bar drinks are on the expensive side, but only average in quality. Our total dinner bill for two people, including two cocktails was $100 not including gratuity.  We were there to celebrate my wife's birthday. She ordered the Sea Bass which she said was quite good. On the other hand, I ordered the Wild Boar Rigatoni which was just on the adequate side in terms of taste and quality. The sauce and rigatoni were good, however the \"wild boar\" was barely edible. It tasted old, was overlooked, dry with a rubbery quality that even the sauce could not improve. Quite disappointing, especially given the price. The lettuce wedge salad was also underwhelming and truly overpriced. I know this is an expensive restaurant and don't mind paying prices when eating out, but I expect better quality for those prices.  On the plus side, my wife was presented with a complimentary dessert which she said was excellent. Our waiter was excellent, never hovering yet was attentive at the appropriate times, allowing us to enjoy the meal.  Because we were there with two other couples I decided not to return my meal and ask for something else because I didn't wasn't to delay things or call attention to our evening, but I truly was dissatisfied with my meal. Oakleys is not high on my recommend list even though others seemed to enjoy their meal, given that this was my third visit there and still feel the quality is not up to par with the pricing. I have given Oakleys a weak 3 stars.",

I enjoyed a drink at the bar while we waited, where we watched one of the chefs bottle up the homemade pickles.  It was both a strange and delightful way to pass the time.  When we were seated, we ordered promptly, though waited a little too long for our food to arrive.  I guess because our party was considered large?  When the food arrived, I enjoyed the quinoa and black bean burger, though found myself wishing it was grilled or sauteed rather than deep fried.  I also paid an upcharge for a grilled sweet potato specialty side, though sent the side back because the sweet potatoes were still hard when I bit into them.  When the waiter returned with the sweet potato FRIES found on the menu, I was delighted by their crispy outsides, tender insides, and perfect degree of saltines.  A few weeks later, I was visiting a friend in the 12th South area, and we ordered the turkey burgers, which were good, but nothing special.  I don't think I'd come to the 12th South area only to visit Burger Up, though I'd stop by again if we're in the neighborhood and craving a decent burger.",

After my group had joined me at the table earlier in the evening, it took about 10-15mins for our server to come over and take their drink order.

First of all, it was probably slightly busier than normal due to the Winter Classic.  Okay, I get that. But this entire visit was completely fumbled by the staff here, and I was ready to leave almost as soon as we sat down.  No one came by to take our drink order. We sat in the direct path of every server in the place (the kitchen entrance was literally one table behind us, so they constantly whizzed by us as breakneck speed), yet waited over 10 minutes just for a Coke and a beer sampler.   For the appetizer, we ordered the pale ale beer bread, which came with a blue cheese cream cheese and bacon jam. YUM. My only complaint is that the bread was totally soaked in grease. The cream cheese kinda slid off, but whatever. I made it work.   The beer sampler was great, too. We tried a variety of stouts, ales and ciders. My wife loved the double bean ale, and their coffee stout is always on point. For 5 small beers for $10, that's pretty much a steal.  The food, though...  I ordered the pulled pork sandwich with potato wedges. Notice that I said wedges, as in plural? Well, I got five. FIVE WEDGES. And one was so big, I held it in my hand and pretended to be on Buffy the Vampire Slayer.  The sandwich was so cold, I didn't even eat it, and the fries were hotter than the surface of the sun. I took the sandwich home, hoping to heat it up later.  My wife got the apple and bacon pizza, if you could call it that. She asked for blue cheese on the side, not knowing that it wouldn't come with cheese otherwise. You know, like a normal pizza. And it didn't have some apple, it had, like, a whole apple. Like giant slices over a measly amount of bacon. It was sad, and it made me sad.   I got my Coke refilled ONCE and that's only because Mary pulled a staff member aside to ask her for it. I felt bad because it wasn't her table, but our server was nowhere to be seen.   My hopes were high, but Schlaflys dashed them.

First off the place is tiny and extremely loud.  I ordered the sea bass, but they were out of it - at 7pm?  Next I tried to order the grouper special - again out of it.  Richard, our waiter told me (confidentially per him) that he could give me the 8 oz lobster tail for $24 along with the mashed potato side and my choice of broccoli or asparagus.  Chose the asparagus.  Chip Ordered the Berkshire pork chop with a pepper rub, mashed potatoes and asparagus.  My lobster was good, but no way was this tail 8 oz before cooking.  Chip's pork chop was a spectacle of gristle and fat.  Despite its huge size he probably got about a half portion due to the bad cut of meat.  His potatoes were pretty good. His asparagus were missing, but when he saw the sad little overcooked spears I received, he figured he'd pass.  When Richard came back and asked if we wanted a box for the uneaten gristle and fat we told him it wasn't necessary and explained why.  To his credit, he apologized and removed the $15 charge for my glass of Groth Sauvignon Blanc, which we thanked him for and appreciated the gesture.  When we got the bill I noticed that I was given an additional charge for the asparagus, even though that was not mentioned when he offered the choice of broccoli or asparagus.  I should say that the house chopped salad, rolls and maple butter were delicious and that's what made me give 1200 two stars instead of one.  Avoid at all costs.

There's nothing I've tried that isn't good, and most things are great.  Fish Taco Tuesday...it should be added to the Outlook calendar as a standard reminder.  Brisket tacos, with BBQ sauce (I add the white sauce too), are splendid.  Tortas, burritos, whatever you pick, you're probably gonna be under $10 with a drink and chips, so splurge for the white, creamy goodness called queso.

I have to say, I'm not as impressed as I thought I would be.   Walking into district donuts, you get a very clean and nice hipster vibe. Their \"extra fancy\" donuts are on display by the cashier. They're very nicely decorated and look delicious.  We ordered the pork belly sliders, Vietnamese iced coffee donut, brown butter donut, coffee, chocolate milk, and an espresso shot. The caffeine was nothing to write home about but the chocolate milk was very good - just sweet enough.  The pork belly slider in my opinion wasn't very good. It needed more daikon radish and the cut of pork belly wasn't fatty enough.  The donuts are very sweet. Almost too sweet. The Vietnamese coffee donut didn't have enough coffee flavor to it.

In fact, most of the menu wasn't that appealing as almost everything is topped with provel cheese - If you've ever been outside of St. Louis, you'll realize this isn't a real cheese - more importantly it tastes like melted plastic.    Aside from that, I went there with my fiance on Saturday night around 7:00 pm.  We waited 15 minutes to receive our first drinks and it went downhill from there.  We were there more than an hour before our burgers were served to us.  The manager was nice enough to apologize and give us each a complimentary drink (which is the only reason I gave two stars instead of one), but that didn't make up for the lackluster burgers - way too heavy on the cheese, grease and butter and way too lacking on flavor.  This place is definitely not worth the hype - the food is not worth the incredibly long wait (our only explanation is that they weren't \"used to having the patio open and it [was] a really busy night\".  Well, if you have a restaurant with a patio, then you should be able to accommodate people in a timely manner.   Greasy burger, extremely greasy fries, slow service.....and all for the low cost of $44 dollars (with the $5 tip we left).

I guess some people start drinking early, but not that many this particular day.  We had never been before but were close by and craved burgers and chicken tenders so we gave it a shot.  Again it's primarily a bar so don't expect it to be a place for a relaxing quiet meal for two.  Nothing wrong with that, especially if you're there to watch a game.  I ordered a burger and my wife got chicken tenders.  We got our ketchup and all that situated and started eating.  My wife took a bite of her chicken and immediately received a burn in her mouth. The tender had a pocket of hot grease in it so when she took a bite, the grease spurted out onto the roof of her mouth.  It was so bad it burned off the skin and started bleeding.  She got some ice from her pop to help ease the pain, but that didn't do much.  I got our server's attention and told her that my wife burned her mouth.  She replied, \"Well, they just came out of the fryer\" and walked off.  We ended up leaving with to-go boxes.  The next day my wife went to the doctor as the burn was still bleeding and painful.  We were angry so we notified the corporate office.  A week or so later we got an apology letter and a $20 gift card.  The person who sent the letter said he spoke to the manager at that location and instructed him to have a meeting with his staff about this incident.  As my wife mentioned in her note to the company, it's common practice for servers to tell patrons when their food has just come out of the oven or fryer and to be careful because it is very hot.  But the issue is really about the server's attitude.  We wouldn't have written corporate if the server had been concerned about my wife's burn.  We used our gift card to order something for carry out and brought it home.  We figured this would let it cool down.  But we've not been back since.  I believe the corporate manager was sincere in what he wrote and am glad he was having the store manager meet with his employees.  However, he should have offered to pay the bill for the doctor's visit.  Hopefully this hasn't happened to someone else.",

I know it's always busy with students from the U of A and being told from them it's a nice area to just hang out, that's a pretty good sign.   Maybe I'm just too picky, but I think it could be better.   \"See it, taste it, Yelp it\"",

Went last night with another couple and ordered warm ricotta with toast, again, great. Mussels were great. Waiter talked us into the meatballs and when 3 arrived for 4 of us, it was awkward. Flavor was good though. Service started great and went downhill from there. The ugly - ordered a sausage pizza and beet salad. Salad never showed but it was left on the bill. We had it removed. The pizza - signature item- DON'T do it!!!!! Sausage pizza had 3 pieces on sausage, no cheese and when the waitress brought it to our table, she told us that they don't cut them because the pizza gets soggy. We asked her to recommend best way to eat it -\"well I suggest a knife and fork\" and away she went! She was right, it was soggy-like someone dipped it in water - how does that happen to a pizza that comes out of a brick oven?  Ava - you need to step up - you should expect more from your brand. Charge based on your portions, be competitive and if you can't serve good pizza - take it off the menu!",

Our waiter recommended the aged ribeye steak--\"best steak ever.\"  I didn't think I wanted an entire 18-ounce boneless, so he suggested we split it.  We did--certainly one of the \"best steaks ever\"--cooked perfectly medium rare and it was plenty for both of us.  Of course, we also had the signature shrimp cocktail (horseradish) and the iceberg lettuce wedge with crumbled bacon (very pancetta-like).   OK, iceberg wedge isn't the most exciting salad, but it's great when done well, which this was.      My only disappointment was a wine list that had a very limited choice of medium-priced wines by the bottle, so wine selection took a while.  A small complaint, so I would rate H & I  4.5 stars if possible.",

When you bring a plate to someone and there is no cutlery recognizing first is a plus but even being attentive enough to bring it when it is asked for is acceptable as well.   There were two cooks for a room holding about 30 people. It shouldn't take that long to make a cold seafood dish. We did make reservations and although the service was very poor it was poor with a smile on their face, so I honestly feel bad and think they can't do any better  Someone might enjoy this place better if it was emptier-the cooking and service would be expected to be better. My suggestion would be to go for the wine and some snack size appies that range from 14-24 dollars, and then walk down to the blue plate diner for a meal that is half the price, excellent service and has that cozy feeling-just in a larger area.",

Huge pieces of Serrano pepper with varying sizes of everything else, and in stark contrast to the other 2, completely dried out.   Without even looking at the menu, I know what I want... #15. That decision hasn't changed for over 10 years. Today I should have made a different choice. I'm not sure if they recently went thru a purveyor change but the quality of everything on the plate was horrible.   I used to love the rice, it changed.

Very friendly staff and bartenders are very attentive to the guests at their rail. Moving on...Parking in the area is a challenge small streets don't help either. I understand it is something out of there control but when developing a restaurant your seating calculator is based on parking spots available. This will let you use areas more productively and efficiently. Also it is very confusing where the front door is or where guests are to come in. The signs in the back just make things more confusing. We would have enjoyed sitting outside the weather was not too bad but with properly placed fire pits you could take advantage of all your patio seating. On to the menu, limited but great because of the size of the establishment and very well priced. The selections were good and diverse which is key to satisfying a variety of palettes but...if you offer small a menu everything that comes out should be perfectly cooked and should taste as good as it looks. I had the pork chop unfortunately it was cooked to a med rare. I do like my pork medium but rare is wrong. My wife had the salmon which looked slightly overcooked but she was fine with it. My friend had the bone in rib eye which was cooked well but as far as taste you can tell it was choice grade and lacked a beefy flavor many look for when ordering that cut. His wife had the tilapia and she did not eat it at all! The breading was soggy and tasteless and was non-visually appealing. Too many bland colors on the menu plate presentation is everything! If it looks good it taste good!  Also we noticed the menu doesn't offer a description of your sides which this technique is usually used in ala carte menus. I am sure your mashed potatoes are a staple to your menu, but it's important for your chef to check potatoes often through the night because they will brown and become gummy if not maintained right as mine were no good. All of us who received the side of vegi's we received cold and very wilted and over cooked.  The last item is we never saw a managers presence we had a food issue and no one came to our table to follow up with us. There was also a table that had children running and screaming which causes safety issues for your staff and the children.

Our waitress arrived and that's when it went downhill. Maybe she was new, IDK, but it took her 3 trips to our table before she was ready to take our order. I asked for a beer to be brought with the meal and not beforehand and she assured me that was not a problem. I was wanting a burger but was told sides were extra, so I went with catfish instead. Wanted a kids meal for my grandson and was informed sides for those were extra as well. What next; extra for silverware? There were no crayons or colouring books for kids to keep them busy or child sized utensils either. Anyways, the food came quick and was tasty. Portion size was very good as well. The waitress came back to check on us after about 10 minutes, at which time my wife was able to inform her that the dressing for her salad, which was supposed to be on the side, was non-existent. About 7 minutes later she came back with the oil and vinegar. We were able to finish our meal and then wait another 10 minutes or so for her to ask if we were ready for our check. During that time we we able to watch as one of the male staff came up to the hostess station and was able to give long, lingering full body hugs to the 14yo and 4 others who had gathered at the front door. When he left, the girls continued the hug fest, in between customers coming in. Such love amongst the staff! 8 minutes later the check arrived, but not before 2 other tables had to go up to hug central and ask for their server, too. Going over the bill, at least I didn't get charged for the beer that is still in their tap! Overall, I feel this place is overrated, and it'll probably be quite awhile before I go there again.

On my second visit, my meal was inedible. I ordered the grilled chicken b\u00fan, and there's no way this meat was merely grilled. It was probably cooked before and microwaved at some point, and it had  weird texture. The chicken was in huge chunks, it badly needed seasoning, and the chunks were extremely dry and tough. The rest of the b\u00fan was a ton of vermicelli noodles (though not exactly the right kind), some shredded iceberg lettuce, a little bit of shredded cucumber, and some bland pickled carrot and radish (no punch to that pickle). Overall, the dish had no flavor, even after dumping the fish sauce over it, and the meat was downright disgusting.  My wife's pho ga was not as good as the pho tai she ordered the time before. The broth was cloudy and had a thick layer of grease on top that needed to be skimmed. The chicken was horribly dry after being boiled for who knows how long.

    "text": "It's a chain restaurant, you get what you expect from chain stores and that is an empty wallet and a 50/50 shot of coming away satisfied.   I've been to this location 3 times since it opened, positives and negatives come out each time but never a full on, \"I'm definitely coming back here\" moment. The menu itself is overwhelming and takes an average person a decade to reach the last page, ever wonder why this place is always jam packed? No one is sure what they want when they've read a novel of a menu. Most restaurants specialize in one or two areas but not here, you have mexican next to Italian with american holding hands with God knows what. With a menu this large always remember these items are rarely fresh made and more likely prepped, refrigerated, warmed up, topped then served. Yay for microwaved $8 soup.   After the disastrous menu combinations comes the decision of a lifetime. I've had the safe choice twice before (Club Sandwich) but this last and possibly final time I chose the Parmesan Chicken Sandwich, Potato Soup and Fries. Ok, I deeply liked the lukewarm potato soup (insert sarcasm). But honestly that was the highlight here. The Parmesan Sandwich was overwhelmingly tasteless with peppers and onions the only distinctive taste that stood out. The chicken tasteless, the sauce ruined by the peppers and onions and the cheese cold and pressed into the bread. So basically I had potato soup with fries, yay carbs. Please don't ask your server what's good or what sells the best, the response is the same all three times, \"All of it is really good\" and that narrows down the \"numbered\" pages of the menu.   My wife loves the chicken medley however she, like me is too afraid to waiver from what tastes ok to try a dish as horrid as mine. We also took home a slice of cheesecake (strawberry and pumpkin). This, was the only highlight of this epic failure. But I swear I can get almost the same quality from Wal-Mart as sad as that is to say. My only wish is that I didn't go for fast food, sad right?  But I will be back to tackle another dish, I refuse to believe there's nothing here that's edible.",

We were warned of possible waiting times so came here on a Saturday around 10:45, and a line was already forming!   For apps, we ordered the takoyaki and fried octopus. The takoyaki are delicious-an order comes with 5 balls that were perfectly cooked and topped with sauces. Takoyaki are little circular doughs with squid in the middle, topped with sauces and squid flakes (?). I definitely recommend this app. As for the fried octopus, it was just fried without sauces on top and came with mayo on the side, but it didn't come with enough mayo to dip the octopus in.  For ramen, I got the red spicy tonkotsu ramen and my SO got the black garlic tonkotsu ramen. For both ramen, the thin noodles were mushy/overcooked and just didn't quite fit with the ramen. That was the flaw with the dishes, and it tasted like the noodles were overcooked in a pot of flour-y water so it wasn't as clean (which explains the mushy feeling). They should use more bouncy noodles for this.  Now let's talk about the broth. The broth is flavorful, but the red chili broth was a bit too spicy for me and covered up the depth of the broth. I prefer the black garlic tonkotsu broth for that reason.  Overall, delicious food and pricing is reasonable.

Our server never let us empty our glasses and  the mimosas were very heavy on the champagne, so we all got a bit tipsy. At least the alcohol let us forget how much weight we gained during this meal.

Says she \"loves Tom Jones\". Our meals included blue ribbons, french toast, chicken, club sandwich & baked potato . Everyone gets what they like.     I don't smell stale smoke and would not call it dirty.  I like the \"loud\" orange booths. I feel like I went back in time with these and the payphone. Service is always fast and I always seem to get a different waitress. Don't know where they find these young ladies but they're good. I've seen different managers there and they are all quick and on top of things-which makes a good manager.    Since it's my daughter's fave I'm bumping it up from 4 to 5 stars.",

I rarely had a friendly server and good luck trying to talk to the manager. I once ordered a cocktail and it tasted like it had been mixed with water. I asked to speak to the manager and I saw him roll his eyes when my waiter told him I had issue with my drink. When he came over I asked why he had rolled his eyes and this set him off. He accused me of being drunk and threatened to call the cops. Considering I had driven from work to there completely sober, I was offended and told him I didn't appreciate his tone considering how often I gave his place business. Apparently they have some type of alcohol measuring system (his words, not mine) that pours the exact amount of booze into all their cocktails (???). Whatever, he offered to give me a drink for free (cool) and all was forgiven.  I moved away, and I miss this place, but that one time kind of put a bad taste in my mouth (no pun intended). I'd recommend the cheeseburger pizza, btw, with a nice glass of chimay.",

At first glance of the menu, you may think you've never heard of any of these foods for breakfast, and you may be right. I guarantee no matter what you order, you're going to enjoy it.   Milktooth is one of the most popular brunch places in Indy, which means you will typically have a wait. Trust me, it's worth the usual 30 minute wait (on weekends). To make it go by a little faster, they've got a walk up bar for their coffee drinks and pastries. Snack on one of those to give you a preview of the amazing meal you're about to have.  Their menu changes from time to time but they have a few things that stay one the menu but change ingredients. I love all of their variations on a Dutch pancake, and their raclette grilled cheese is to die for.  If you're making this a boozy breakfast, don't pass up on the michelada.

I selected the single scoop in a waffle cone which was a nice sized scoop and was quickly out the door to enjoy the frozen goodness. The ice cream was nice and creamy but the frozen bread chunks (at least I think that's what they were) were a little odd for me. The waffle cone was fresh and crispy and the perfect accent to finish off the ice cream. It was a nice, tasty, refreshing treat, but a little expensive for a cone in my opinion.",

The interior is dimly lit and full of vibrant colors from tapestries and decorated pillows that adorn the seating areas. Our party of six was seated in a backroom upstairs - incredibly comfortable and got me excited for the meal.  The waiter first arrives and asks for very few decisions about the 7-course meal. We opted for the spicy chicken and then the lamb entree, accompanied by a vegetarian option for our one friend. We also ordered two carafes of cheap wine - $12 each. The waiter then returns with a partner carrying a giant metal bowl with a teapot on top. He asks that everyone puts their hands in the center of the table then pours water over them and asks you to wash up; a towel is placed over everyones' hands to dry off. They soon return with smaller towels that are draped over your laps in indication of the messy meal that will soon begin.  The first course is a three-salad platter consisting of cucumber and tomato - coriander marinated carrots and cooked eggplant in tomato sauce. They bring out a giant basket full of pita breads and offer you to take as many as you'd like. This salad was delicious and probably my favorite part of the meal. Next is a giant pie made of phyllo dough stuffed with scrambled eggs, parsley and ground chicken. It's topped with powdered sugar and cinnamon. This wasn't well received because the chicken was sparse and the dish was too sweet overall. It was also very hard to eat the crumbly ground chicken and eggs with your hands.  Two main courses are presented - the first being an entire roasted chicken covered in a spicy cumin sauce. This chicken was delicious, perfectly cooked but the skin was not crispy enough for my taste, fortunately it was easy to remove. Next is a roasted lamb shank off the bone, covered in honey and slivered almonds. The meat was cooked well but like the chicken pie, this dish was way too sweet for my tastes. Finally is a couscous with chick peas, raisins and shredded chicken. I prefer my couscous sticky and salty but this was very sweet and moist, almost stew-like.  For dessert you are brought a plate of bananas, oranges and apples, a plate of delicious baklava and very sweet hot mint tea.  Overall Marrakesh is a lot of fun - you get to experience a traditional Moroccan meal and have plenty of time to relax and chat with your friends. I would have prefered less sweet and more savory dishes but others might disagree. Expect to spend around two hours eating. After wine we thought it was a bit pricey but still not too bad for the city - it came to about $37 a person including tip.",

Now i don't know if these other yelpers being from a small town knew what real thai food should taste like but this ain't it.

Now being from atlanta we had our fair share of pad thai and this was horrible the pad thai was wet, watery, too sweet  and the sauce tasted like grocery store bought generic pad thai sauce.

Now, in all fairness, I treat gravy like an entree as opposed to an accompaniment, so for \"normal\" folk, you may find the gravy quantity acceptable.  I went with bacon, which was really good - thick slices, nice and crispy.  And my eggs were cooked perfectly to order.  I really liked the crispy potatoes, as well.  Two, small whole potatoes, well seasoned and seared on the outside.  The OJ was fresh and tasty - not too tart.   My friend had the nest egg.  She thought it was really tasty, but since I didn't try it, I don't have much to say about that.   I think the food is excellent.  I will agree with other reviews - not a fan of the community seating.

Once inside, we took in the serpentine bar and packed tables with some difficulty (it was quite dark) and luckily found seats right away; by the time we left, over an hour later, people were standing three deep all around the bar.   We started out sitting at one of the bar islands, directly across from three strangers; this might appeal to some extreme extroverts, but it was a little awkward for us. They paid us no attention and had a very loud conversation (trendy vocal-fry girls -- ugh) so we tried to return the favor, but they were hard to ignore, so when true bar seats opened up we scooted over and left them to their workplace gripes.  The drink menu is pretty wonderful; awesome draft / bottle selection, in addition to a handful of craft cocktails. We stuck to beer and were not disappointed; the bartender, once he saw what we liked, offered us a couple of samples and was able to continue making us happy through several more rounds.   We weren't dinner-hungry, but wanted to try the battered green beans since so many had raved about them. They were pretty disappointing; the beans were overcooked and stringy, and the batter stuck together in huge lumps -- it was more like a battered green bean sculpture. We ate about half and left the rest. Next we tried the fried pretzel, which was good, though not exactly pretzel-like, since it had been deep-fried instead of soda-boiled. The accompanying queso was delicious, but there was only one small ramekin, so we ate most of the pretzel plain.  It turned out there had been quite a party a few hours earlier, as the first friday of every month is a pig roast. It sounded intriguing, but our server didn't know any of the details -- where, how and for what amount of time it was cooked, for instance -- so we didn't try it.  We would definitely return for the beer, and to try one of their standbys like the burger or the brick chicken.",

Not the seamless experience I wanted, and it stopped me from ordering an additional dozen. I was also surprised there wasn't a different type of dipping sauce, like a mignonette offered. I'm happy to make my own cocktail sauce, but I was surprised... The gumbo? For me, it was odd - all roux, with not much seafood, chicken or sausage.

    "text": "Very accommodating!  I say this because I ate here last week, which was not to long ago, for a friend's birthday. There were about 7 of us, total. I called twice to change the reservation time, and they were very polite about it.  We were worried about not being able to eat here because we found out one of my friends has a peanut allergy. Knowing the way Asian restaurants work, a lot of them use peanut oil or peanut products in their food.  Three people that worked there came up to our table to listen to our orders to make sure that they got it right, and to omit any peanuts in the dishes. I believe one of them might have been the manager. If that isn't good service, I don't know what is!  We ordered the roti canai (indian pancake), shrimp puff, young chow fried rice, hainanese chicken, sizzling beef, shrimp pad thai, deep fried shrimp with ginger soy sauce.  The roti is probably their most famous dish. Once you try it you'll know why. As soon as we sat down I asked if we could order an appetizer to start (since everyone was hungry and it was already 8pm). She asked if I wanted roti and how many, before I could even ask what I wanted. How'd she know? Two please!  The shrimp puff was so delicious! I'm warning you though to let it sit for a bit and give it 5 minutes. It is served HOT and WILL burn your tongue. The sauces tend to squirt out into your mouth as soon as you bite into it, which is no fun when it's extremely hot! Wait it out and you'll thank me later. The sauce was a nice touch to the shrimp puff. Very cohesive appetizer. You should definitely try this one.  Fried rice was average, as any Asian restaurant's fried rice is.  Hainanese chicken was very different ... never had anything like it. It's completely baked but served at room temperate so it gives off the feeling that it's being served \"cold\". It's actually pretty good with the soy sauce (which is served under the chicken) if you can get over the way it looks and the cold texture. We we're actually served a piece that was still blue and looked like a cyanotic chicken extremity which turned me off completely, even being in the medical field. Shivers. We decided just to set it aside and remove it so we wouldn't have to look at it anymore.  The sizzling beef was absolutely.. FORGETTABLE. Do not get this dish. It lacked flavor, and did not come out sizzling. Womp, womp.  The pad thai is also just an average dish. Nothing too special going on, probably would not get it again since I could get better pad thai elsewhere.  Now I saved the best part for last.. the deep fried fish! It normally comes with other sauces, but we requested to do a simple ginger and soy sauce. This is the best fried fish, ever! We all couldn't get our hands off it and fought for the last morsel! Main reason it was so good was because it was so crispy! Good to share due to it's size. Fairly big. I would totally go back for this.

The caf\u00e9 is small, but quaint, in typical Moorestown fashion.  The girl behind the counter handed me a menu and also directed me to their specials board. I felt that their menu was a little lacking in vegetarian selections.  The only cold sandwich option was egg salad (which they were out of today), and the hot selections were basically variations of grilled cheese. No vegetarian selections on the specials board either.  I could have gone for like a grilled veggie Panini.    No worries, though.  I ordered a mozzarella, tomato, and balsamic Panini.  I went to run my errand while I waited for my lunch to be prepared.  I also had to stop at an ATM because I learned when I got there that they take CASH ONLY.  I ran my errand, picked up my lunch, and went back to the office.    By the time I got back to the office, my Panini was still warm, and was really good. The balsamic vinegar gave it a nice flavor, and the tomatoes were fresh.  The Panini was grilled just perfectly.  I give The Cubby Hole 3 stars, A-OK.  They definitely lose a star for being cash only.  I never carry cash.  Also, I'd like to see a more extensive menu for vegetarians.

The wine menu was about what you would expect, all the traditional wines with the cheapest (only a couple) in the low $20s for a bottle and quickly escalating to high prices from there.   We passed on appetizers and desserts and both ordered the seafood pasta. I would say we were both underwhelmed by it to be honest.

The staff appeared to be on drugs - dazed and clueless.  The check: Arrived with 18% gratuity tacked on. Turns out that on one of the back pages of the menu - the desert menu there is a notice that parties 6 and above will be charged automatically. This statement must appear on every page of the menu...   The owner: The real problem is that we were a party of 5... That did not prevent the despicable owner of the restaurant to instruct the server to apply the automatic tip.  When confronted, instead of apologizing and offering to refund the tip, he showed us the door poetically telling us that customers are like birds, they come and go, makes no difference to him.  So, you decide if such a loathsome human being deserves your business. There are plenty of other Mediterranean restaurants in the area that serve better food, have much better service, and don't steal from their customers.",

    "text": "Probably one of the WORST experiences I've had in a restaurant :( Let me just start off saying, the food is good! Nothing wrong with any of the food, the chefs are amazing and we all enjoyed our food. The problem was with the service....  We made a reservation for 9 at 7:15 and we ended up getting their around 6:45. We were told we needed to wait because there wasn't enough chefs, which is TOTALLY fine and understandable. Then the woman at the front seats a party of 2 and another party of 3. So I asked why they were able to sit down before our group (and by this time it was about 7-7:10) and she told me because they had a smaller group.... Okay well if we had a reservation wouldn't we be first to sit down? We didn't care if the chef wasn't ready we just wanted to sit down order drinks and have some appetizers. We were then seated and our server Ivan came over very promptly which was nice. After he got our first round of drinks this is where things went down hill.   We ordered some sushi, simple sushi. Salmon, and shrimp. We ordered 2 rolls, a crunch roll and a shrimp tempura roll. He brought out yellowtail, tuna and 2 veggie rolls. I kindly said that the food wasn't ours and that wasn't what we ordered. He told me that it was and that I was wrong. So I asked to see the sushi paper because maybe I marked the wrong thing. And then he said he threw the paper away but he took the sushi away with a HUGE attitude and said he would go try and find the paper. Well our group could see him in the back area and he pulled the paper out of his apron and came over and said oh yeah I guess it was my fault I brought you guys the wrong stuff.... Okay that's what we tried explaining! The stuff finally comes out and tasted perfect! So then some of us ordered the teppan and we got our miso soup and then once that was done we got our salad. None of us had forks and I'm pretty sure maybe 1 out the 9 of us knew how to use chopsticks so I asked for forks and he said yeah no problem. Well we waited out 10 minutes until we saw him again and couldn't find any other servers to ask for their help so we ended up just eating with our fingers. We finally see Ivan and asked for forks again and he said, \"do you honestly need them right now? Your food isn't being cooked!\" EXCUSE ME! I was so furious that he would even come back with such attitude. All of the girls needed forks and so we told him, yes we need them now. I almost got up to go find them myself! Anyways, chef comes, food turned out good and no Ivan to be found for about 30 minutes. So 2 girls in our group asked for boxes, myself included, and it took him about 15 minutes to get them so I ended up eating the last bit of food I was going to take home. So when he brought my box I said, \"I'm sorry, I don't need the box anymore I finished what I was going to take home, but thank you!\" (very politely) He then came back with \"ok well maybe if I take your plate away you'll stop changing your mind\" WHAT IN THE HELL!!!! At this point I was done trying to be nice. After2 and half hours I was so glad to be leaving! Ivan was so rude to ALL of the girls in our group! I hope if we go back, which we probably won't, that Ivan will not be there. I always try and give people the benefit of the doubt and maybe he was having a bad day, but if your day is that bad, don't come into work and be mean and rude to your customers. I work with the public and believe me, it's hard to always please everyone. But it's unacceptable to be rude to people!!",

    "text": "Took the whole fam jam, including Gramma, out to Wok House last night in St. Albert.  We've been eagerly awaiting the opening this past week because their banner outside read:  Chinese, Dim Sum, Bubble Tea!  Yep, that's right - St. Albert now has Dim Sum and Bubble Tea!!!  The location is in the old Banana Leaf Restaurant next door to Simply Donair in the same strip mall as Dairy Queen.  We were greeted by a friendly family who let us choose anywhere in the restaurant to sit - kiddos opted for the booth/bench option.  The decor was modern and clean.  The menu variety REALLY surprised me and all Dim Sum is cooked to order rather than coming around on carts.   We decided we might as well go hard and try stuff from all parts of the menu.  First off, we ordered bubble teas:  Fresh fruit mango dairy free with sago, fresh fruit peach dairy free with sago, and milky matcha green tea with sago.  ALL WERE EXCELLENT.  The waitress waited to see if I liked he matcha because she warned that it's not very sweet and said she could make it sweeter if I preferred but I'm a matcha monster and this was exactly what I was looking for :-)    Next up, they brought out a couple of small appetizers for us to share in celebration of their opening - spring roll, tempura shrimp, and a dry garlic rib:  all were excellent with my 7 year old requesting more of each!  We decided to share the dinner for 2 which came with spring rolls, chicken fried rice, 2 bowls of soup (won ton and hot & sour were both decent) and 2 entree choices:  we selected Honey Pepper Shrimp (DIVINE) and sliced Szechuan beef.   Both of the mains were good and flavourful with a good amount of sauce.  Everyone in our group noted that the use of onions was pretty heavy and more peppers, corn, carrots, etc. would be nice.  I'd say the dishes were at about 1/3 white onions - usually this is a deal breaker for me but the sauces and meat quality were superb.   Next up was our never ending sampling of Dim Sum:  Pork Buns - $4.99 good but smaller than most; my daughter didn't care for them here  and neither did Gramma (not sure why).  Sticky Rice (Excellent but it only comes with 2 small leaves for $4.99 - this could be vastly improved by adding a 3rd one for that price or putting more rice in each banana leaf.  Literally, the banana leaves had less than 1/2 of the amount of rice you would have at Jumbo).   Beef skewers - not as pictured and not up to snuff in my opinion for $4.99 for 2.  Green Onion Cake - $4.99 a standard that my kids will insist on every visit though I prefer mine to be a little crunchier.  Pan fried meat dumplings - $4.99 standard but they don't bring red wine vinegar or whatever that sauce is most Dim Sum places serve with it.  Curried Squid - $4.99 Excellent and tender but I would LOVE the sauce to be a bit thicker and more plentiful to pour all over my rice :-)  We'd order 80% of the food again and to be able to have Dim Sum in St. Albert any day of the week at any time, we will most DEFINITELY be returning here.    Even if Mom and Dad want regular Chinese food, the kids in our house will jump for joy at Sticky Rice, Green Onion Cakes, and Bubble Tea!  Service was friendly but slow tonight with our dishes coming as much as 60 minutes apart - YIKES!  But I won't fault them on this as they work out their bugs, hopefully in the future we will get things (like rice) before the rest of the meal.  Cheers Wok House, can't wait to come back!  P.S. They deliver, too!",

Our entrees were the Steak and Frites and the Braised Lamb with Fresh Herbed Pasta.  The steak was perfectly cooked and well seasoned, the fries were limp and greasy.  The herbed pasta dish was interesting but there were only two tiny pieces of lamb, must have been less than 2 oz of meat in this dish.

The rabbit/chicken pate and gumbo were well done, but once we moved on to the entrees the blue crab cavatelli and louisiana shrimp were served lukewarm, so it was hard to warm up (so to speak) to these two dishes.  We didn't mention this to our server until the end of the meal, at which point the manager came over and had those two entrees removed from our bill.  Service overall was not up to my expectations  Our server only checked on us once during the course of the meal, and a folding tray twice crashed to the floor near us, this should have been fixed after the first occurrence.  Overall, the food rated 3 stars, minus another star for the service, plus a star for adjusting our bill.

I asked my boyfriend if he wanted a bite of mine and he sort of pulled back and said 'no, i mean, obviously we're going to be coming back, so we can just try a different type next time'.  Dude loved his chicken taco. And I loved my shrimp taco! I hear the pulled pork tacos were also pretty magnificent. The chips and guacamole were delicious, but for the price I would like a little more guacamole. The spicy rim margarita really hit the spot and was a great accompaniment to the tacos and, at $5.50, i think they were reasonably priced. (I had 5) but what I don't like to see with any margarita is a bartender pulling out a jigger and measuring precisely two jiggers of booze. For that, you get four stars, revolucion. live a little! get me greased up, liquored up, super slick and oil my gears!  The fried potatoes were pretty 'meh', but the 'pink death' hot sauce was killer. I think it removed a layer of my tongue while still managing to be flavorful, so that was pretty stellar. So now in a Rocky Dennis fashion, I will break down for you the 'Things that I love'  Things That I loved: (the sun on my face)  -affordability -deliciousness -freshness -an atmosphere where you go, eat your taco and then sit around for a few hours drinkng because it's just a chill place to be.  Things That I Didn't love: (the sun on my face)  -Not being a bit loose with the tequila -mediocre taters having to wait in line every time i wanted to order another margarita. Like I said, I drank 5 and a daquiri. Every additional margarita meant me waiting in line to order it. That's not so awesome.  -THEY WOULD NOT MAKE A MOJITO! get out of here with that!  But we will definitely be frquenting!",

    "text": "I fell in love with Three Muses after looking at Yelp reviews and the restaurant's website. I feel that the website led me to believe it was a more formal tablecloth kind of place and I was a bit surprised when I arrived.  I could care less about tablecloths, just a minor observation as a direct result of the website.  When we arrived 20 minutes early for our 6pm Tuesday evening reservation we were greeted by the hostess and immediately informed that no matter what, there is a very strict policy that we would only have the table for 1.5 hours and that if we wanted to enjoy the music after that, we would have to go to the bar. I completely understand why this is their policy, but early on a weeknight when the restaurant is more than half empty it is a bit rude to start with the policy. Plus, what if our meal had taken longer than 1.5 hours? Are you booted to the bar for dessert?  Anyway, onto the food...below is a list of the items we ordered any any commentary:  -Italian baked Mac & Cheese-I LOVE every kind of cheese possibly imaginable and I was so excited for this dish. When it arrived the pasta was a little too firm and the flavor was extremely bland.  My friends and I barely ate a quarter of the dish. I would never order that again.  -Seared Scallops-I didn't eat them but my friends thought they were scrumptious.  -Bacon wrapped blue cheese stuffed dates-these were incredible. For three of us we got the large order and though they were amazing, I kind of wish we got the small order only because they were so rich. A good kind of rich. I would order these again.  -Beer-Braised Kurobuta Pork Belly-I thought these were really bland, too. I wouldn't order them again.  -Steak & Cake-I only at the steak. I was told the crab cake was amazing and one of the best my friend ever had. The steak was awesome and so tender and flavorful.  -Ms. Moon's Bulgogi Rice Bowl-This item didn't seem to fit in as well with the other items on the menu but don't let it stop you. It was very very yummy and I would absolutely order it again if I went back. It was a hearty portion and the bowl was basically all but licked at the end to eat it all.  -Cardamon Panna Cotta (Ponchatoula Strawberry, Pistachio Biscotti)-I am not a huge panna cotta fan but my friend is and he loved it. I thought it was pretty good when I tried it but have no frame of reference with which to provide any more feedback.   -Fluffernutter Pie (Bruleed Marshmallow, Salted Peanuts)-I was intrigued by this option and ordered it. I was underwhelmed and barely at any.  -Warm Chocolate Cream Cheese Brownie (Malted Vanilla Ice Cream, Cherry)-per our waitress' recommendation we substituted the vanilla ice cream for brandied butter pecan ice cream and boy was she right. This was AMAZING. I loved the ice cream the most out of all elements of the three desserts. The brownie was tasty though I am not a huge chocolate fan.  The live music was nice and the atmosphere was okay. I have a feeling later on a weekend it would be a lot more lively and fun (and packed).",

They have sandwiches that are 12'  -- you can order just the sandwich or a combo that includes a fountain drink and a side of chips.  [ Breakdown ] Combos (depending what you get): $4.95-$6.65 Single 12' sandwich: $3.00 - $4.95 They also sell variates of  spring rolls ( YUM )and have a section for Asian baked goods, smoothies, mocha freezes, and boba drinks!!

A grilled cheese is about the cheapest thing you can get on the lunch menu at $5, which isn't horrible, but I'm usually horrified by the prices of wraps and salads, which range from $10-$11. They don't even come with fries, just a small bag of chips and a pickle. I never like eating in a restaurant where I feel like they're pinching every penny, and that is definitely the impression I get here.

The tables are a bit close, with the angle of our table I was practically sitting in the next table, we actually joked with them about it.  Our server was pretty amazing, she got drinks, kept them refilled and took our first course orders, she kept checking back and never made us feel rushed.  My husband and I started off sharing\u200b a number of appetizers -we started with crab rangoon, gyoza, shrimp shumai and spring rolls. The food came up pretty quickly considering how full the restaurant was.   The spring\u200b rolls were light and crisp, the crab rangoon pretty standard, the shrimp shumai was\u200b moist\u200b but the flavor was really blah. The gyoza was HORRIBLE, they were hard, dry and not any better than we'd buy in any supermarket\u200b.  The biggest challenge I have is with the food runners, they have several young guys who seem to speak very little English\u200b. They kind of grunt when they come to the table and food is shoved in front of you, whether there is any room or not.   The portions are relatively small, I completely understand that they will bring you as much as you need. But, the plates they use are HUGE for three small pieces of shumai and the guys running food spill all of\u200b the sauces out of the wells in the dishes.  For my second round,\u200b I had the Hot and Sour Soup - it was very good, not to think\u200b or heavy, nicely\u200b spiced with lots of tofu and vegetables.  The Seaweed Salad was chilled, a few kinds of seaweed, nice flavor.  The Chicken Tempura was more\u200b tonkatsu, breaded and fried crisp\u200b, moist and crunchy but not a tempura batter.  I finished up with a Philadelphia and a Spicy Tuna maki roll as well as some sashimi - tuna, salmon\u200b, \u200b and escolar\u200b. All three were well chilled, thinly sliced and very fresh.

I saw Gio's listed on a list of italian restaurants in the area and decided to try it out.   Gio's is towards the back of the set of strip stores anchored by Marshalls just north of Waters.  In fact, coming from the north, I was directed by the GPS to take the left off of Dale Mabry onto Humphrey, then a right on N. Himes and a right on Waters and pull into the area by Gold's Gym.  This actually turned out to be the best way there considering the work traffic heading north around 6 pm on both Dale Mabry and Waters..   We got there around 6 pm on a Wednesday night and the place was somewhat empty.  There were about 8 other customers seated at one table and that was it.  By the time we left, around 7:00 pm, another 20 customers had piled in and were seated.   My wife and I started off with two glasses of California (Foxbrook?) Cabernet wine and a Caprese salad.  The salad was 3 slices of tomatoes and mozzarella in a vinaigrette dressing and chopped basil on a bed of mixed greens.  The dressing was a perfect mix of balsamic vinaigrette oil.  I hate it when the vinaigrette is over powering and too sharp.  This wasn't My wife had a entree of eggplant parmesan with a side of linguine pasta.  Half eaten and half came home.  Was it good?  \"yes, indeed\".  She is a Tiramisu groupie at heart and finished with that as dessert.  Timamisu?  \"excellent, creamy, flavorful\". My entree was the Veal Bellavista which was a veal scallopini saut\u00e9ed with mushrooms, artichokes, capers in a lemon butter sauce with a side of saut\u00e9ed mixed vegetables.  Excellent.  The cabernet was a subtle cabernet, not an overpowering one that tastes great with a large grilled steak so it complemented the entire meal.   I finished with a double expresso.    Service:  attentive but not overbearing.  helpful and willing to hold a conversation with you if you so enjoy.  Otherwise, respectful.

Paid by card & left a 4$ tip on a 22$ takeout order.   As they gave me the food i asked if i could have hot sauce as well and was told by the young man that thats 1$ extra... i had no cash only card but i was surprised because i was just there yesterday cus my bf is sick and picked up an order with the hot sauce without having to pay anything for it. The older man yesterday was super friendly to me and said if i ever need sauce to just ask so i was baffled that now i had to pay for it. Additionally this is the same sauce that is sitting on the table. I didn't ask for extra sauce! I let the young man know that if he wanted to charge me a $1 to go ahead but i had gotten it for free before to which he replied the rules have changed. And when i said that was yesterday he mumbled and walked away and begrudgingly filled a container for me and as he handed it said next time its a 1$...   Why do i have to pay extra to get the same sauce sitting on the table which i got for free the other day. Secondly i tipped u $4 on takeout. Ive worked in the business. People rarely tip for pickup so you still have the nerve to be a dick... I walked away with the food pissed off that this really just happened. and he had the nerve to yell nothing is free as i was walking away. All this commotion occurred with customers in the store.  Great customer service!   Oh and when i get home only one bag of toppings was provided for two orders, with only 1 lime wedge to be shared by two people...   Sucks as this is the only pho place around and i finally grew to like their pho. Refuse to go back and give my money to that little twerp.",

Our decision to dine here was largely based on the fact that it was pouring raining and this restaurant is next door to our hotel. We started with the bacon garlic oysters and jumbo buffalo wings. The bacon garlic oysters were average, at best. The oysters were overpowered by the cheese and bacon, which was disappointing. The buffalo wings were pretty good and seasoned well. For entrees, we ordered: 1) jumbalaya pasta, 2) blackened red fish and 3) canal street red fish. The jumbalaya pasta lacked flavor and was our least favorite (would not order again). The blackened red fish was just okay and the skimpy side of saut\u00e9ed veggies (spinach, tomatoes, mushrooms) were VERY salty (would order again as a LAST resort). The canal street red fish wasn't great but my friend would order it again. Her biggest complaint was that it had very little garlic sauce. We also ordered paddle boat drinks, which tasted good but were more juice vs alcohol (had to order an extra shot).  So, overall, we were underwhelmed with the food, making it a solid 3 stars. On a positive note, our server, Alexander, was great...very hospitable and tried his best to make sure we were satisfied.",

Our waitress stopped by our table around the 15 mins mark wait for food to tell us that our food was about to be out. After waiting another 15 mins our food did not come out. We kept waiting another 10 mins went by our waitress came by finally and apologized for how long it was taking... I really don't like it when the wait staff says its going to be out soon and it's not, make sure you are 100% sure before promising that. We waited another 10 mins and finally our food was out. Now getting to the food.  Overall the food was okay, I got the fish tacos(mahi mahi and shrimp taco, my husband got a soup in a bread bowl. The mahi mahi taco was delicious the shrimp taco was a little lacking in flavor. What I really disliked about my order was the salsa and guacamole(not sure what it was but it looked like a sad attempt at guac) The guac had a weird consistency almost like tooth paste I didn't even want to try it.

The table next to us began to have the same complaint as they arrived and didnt get waited on until about 15 minutes after seating.  The food itself was average but it did not make up for the complete ineptitude of service that became so frustrating to our table(all of us are waiters and bartenders).  This is now the second straight time coming here with the same server and the experience was beyond bad.  When we were finally finished and paid, of course a manager was the first person to the table to come and clean it up before we had all even gotten up but refused to check in at all during the dinner.

Granted, we did go at an off time 3PM which is between lunch and dinner so what I have to report may be influenced by not being on their regular meal schedule and their prep may not be as good at this time.  The ambiance is not anything wowing, but it is clean and bright with photos from Greece on the wall depicting what most Americans think of when they think of Greece, very old buildings that were built to last the test of time.  My meal was just so-so.  I wouldn't say it was bad, just that it lacked the flare I was expecting.  The stewed veggies were delicious.  The chicken, rice, and hummus were average.  The gyro meat my partner ordered looked a bit dark and oily, which may be because it hadn't been ordered in a while and he was getting the outer part of the meat that cooks on the skewer.  The service is what made me give them a 2 star instead of a 3.  Our server was a young guy.  It was difficult to hear what he was saying because he ran words together and mumbled.  This guy might have been Greek, but I'm pretty sure he was at least 3rd generation American.  We had to repeat what we were reading directly off the menu several times for him to get it.  We both ordered drinks, neither of which showed before or during the meal.  I would have brought this up, but we had water and the ordering was so poor I didn't want to have the interaction again.    Now the dessert, that's another story...the baklava was amazing, good sized portion, and the honey on top was sublime.  We also got the peach gelato which comes in a frozen peach.  It was also delicious.  After the first bite, my eyes widened as I looked at my partner with excitement.  I would definitely go there again, just for dessert after eating somewhere else in that Fairmount area.  The service did get better for dessert as a woman took charge of our table, which leads me to believe it was the end of the guy's shift.  She did notice that my partner had ordered a coffee later and asked if he wanted it with dessert.  I did not see the first guy anytime after dessert and he probably left.  Finally, hours later, both my partner and I had higher stomach acid issues, not severe, but enough to make me not want to return for a full meal.  My suggestion to the owners would be to watch those in-between times and give a little more effort/direction to serving/kitchen staff since there is more time without the traffic.",

We did have a few people trying to order drinks for our group at the same time and well that didn't seem to impress her very much.  The drinks were tasty and a few more drinks were ordered during our wait.  We had two tables for our group and a couple of servers.  Overall the staff was hit and miss.  Some were friendly and others made us feel like we were bothering them by being there.  Our group was not the most quiet group around but it's New Orleans and we dropped over 1500 + tabs at the bar earlier in the evening and we weren't inappropriate in any way, just laughing and having fun with our friends from our industry.

I liked the onion and butter on it too: made it yummy and  special (a nod by the chef that,  even thought it was just steak, he/she were willing to make the effort). Now that I know they nailed the steak I will be back for the more adventurous items on the menu. The mussels were very fresh and tasty.  The broth was subtle and delicious. I don't like it when the broth is too garlicky or salty--not a problem.  I liked the dessert: a goat cheese cheesecake--sweet and fluffy.  If they didn't make it there, it was close by at the hands of someone who knew what they were doing.  I hate being served a Costco cheesecake that is not fresh and overly cold from recent thawing, and frankly you get that a lot in Tucson.  The creme brulee was very tasty too: big portion with tangy blueberries and strawberries.  Wait staff was very good.  Smiled and were nice, but not phony.  I like staff that are engaged in their work, but not too earnest or chatty--good job. The room was comfortable, cool (it was 106 outside) and clean.  The table was sturdy (Tucson restaurants, why is this such a continual issue out there?) and the chairs substantial and cool looking.   Why I can't give Maynard's a 4 or 5 stars rating yet: I think it's cheap of them not to offer bread with the mussels (I had to ask, granted it was nice bread!).  The Bloody Mary tasted bad.  It had a neato bit of asparagus, but it tasted like a Slim Jim and was pretty weak on the liquor side of the equation.  It was bad enough to send back, but I chocked it down.  I just won't put out $8 bucks for a cocktail here again.  The 'frites sauce' is catsup: not special catsup either. Wine--yes red wine is supposed to be room temp. But that means about 65 degrees or so.  I think it had maybe sat at the bar overnight and warmed a bit much? Serving Zin that warm gives it a harsh edge and a stale feel.  Thank god I was having a steak with it.  The choice of 'warm' wine might be the sommelier's style.  Which is fine, but forget about me agreeing by buying more.  I will go back and order something more challenging food wise.  To be on the safe side, I will have a simpler cocktail and enjoy a beer with my food.",

They also have a few pre-made hot items. The hot dogs are okay. But it's hard to mess up a hot dog. They hot breakfast sandwiches and snack items are below average. Cheap and quick but so not worth it.  Go hear for a candy bar, drink, or other package snack item. Don't go here for anything that's actually prepared by them. It's just not that good.",

Sure, I've had to devote the special instructions field on every order to an all caps reminder for their drivers to \"PLEASE DON'T FORGET THE DIPS!\", and there were still several incidents where an apologetic driver had to run back to the store to get forgotten items, but it was getting a little better.   Now, however, even the extra reminder isn't helping,  and it's not just dips, but 2 liter sodas that get left behind when the drivers leave the store with a delivery. Tonight, I paid for 2 ranch dips to go with 16 boneless wings, and there was only one in the box. I guess it's time for another round of customer service complaints.   I wish they'd just automatically include 1 free dip for every 8 wings like their competitors do. Then perhaps their driver training would stick. At the very least, they should not trust that the cooks are filling their delivery bags correctly without checking the order against the receipt,  but I guess that additional step would only extend their already 1.5-hour delivery time (on a good night!).",

This place is a little dirty but that's part of the atmosphere as noted in another review.  Not roach dirty of course.  So if you're looking for a decent sized bar and bar food then this place is for you.  If you want a decent sit-down meal however...  Our waitress was pretty cute but a little neglectful and forgot my fries and water.  Meh, it's a bar.  When I mentioned it she at least offered to get the fries.  Sue K. noted in her review \"Had some high expectations for this place with the reviews I read and the opinions I heard and I ended up highly disappointed. We ordered baby back ribs and there was a good portion but the ribs were dry as anything.\"  I would agree.  I had the babybacks and they were pretty dry.  My partner wasn't thrilled with her sampler platter either so she asked to speak to someone about it.  The manager came over and explained that they cook their ribs to 'have some tug' - meaning that they aren't 'over cooked' as he said and fall off the bone.  So make sure you have some good teeth.  Personally I prefer 'fall off the bone' ribs.  I would also note that there wasn't much taste either.  I wasn't too thrilled with the sauce - which was on the side.  The owner's girlfriend (Jennifer) came over and wanted to speak with us about our experience.  For this I was really surprised and really appreciated her concern.  The owners at least don't run the place like a bar which is a good thing in my book.  She refunded the full meal and requested we come back so they could make it up to us.  I probably won't go back but I do appreciate the offer.  Looks like it would be a nice local bar though.  The owners are pretty cool and I wish them luck!",

Those places are crap.   I'm a lover of the south side pizza joints. Nick & Vito's and Roseangela's are the two best pizza places in Chicago, period. If I go dish Due's and Gino's are preferred.   I digress, 312 Pizza is definitely a super noisy place and they really need to focus on the wait staff. Other folks have commented that they sat with empty beer/wine glasses for several minutes or so. This is a big no-no in the restaurant business. Hopefully they work out these kinks in the coming months.  The pours on Vino were also pretty weak. Look, I know you have \"measured\" amount that you've instructed your bartenders to abide by but c'mon, get a little bit  more generous on the pour.   Otherwise, the food is good. I haven't ordered a dish pizza yet but the thin cracker crust reminds me of home. Good flavor with the sauce and the sausage crumble was italian chicago authentic. Bravo.   I'm really hoping 312 can overcome some of these underlining issues as we need it to survive. I've only been down here for a few years and I'm already bored of the neapolitan places that are saturating this market (Desano's, Five points, etc).

Indian food is delicious but I am horrible at remembering what I ordered before. Unfortunately this review is another victim of my not being able to remember the names of what we ordered. One dish was mostly spinach (a total hit), another was some red chicken dish (perfectly cooked but looked like it was dyed red), and naan which is everyone's favorite. If you know your Indian dishes you won't be disappointed. Kids are always welcome there. Be sure to enjoy downtown while you're there.",

Decided to do Tampa Pizza Company since we hadn't gotten it in a while. Unfortunately chose to use the EatStreet Yelp online ordering option.  Huge mistake. Order placed, got confirmation and credit card was charged. Went over to pick up food 20 Minutes later as requested and they said they didn't get the order. They stated they don't accept Yelp/EatStreet orders online anymore. Never bothered to call us and say they actually canceled the Yelp order on us. They told us we should just re-order and pay again in the restaurant and wait another 20 minutes for it to be prepared and get a refund from EatStreet! Won't be going back with this poor customer service. Manager was even there and not helpful at all.

From the time we ordered our first drinks until the time the waitress bothered to come back and check on us was over an hour...we were so thirsty that people were going to the bar by themselves and paying cash...and hungry...we were ready to order food no one in sight, that it was sad.  One of the women with us, who had waitressed in a prior life, actually considered pulling the girl aside and explaining to her how much she was losing in tips.  And it is a tiny dining room and the place was mostly empty until about 5 PM.  The food barely rose above Chipoltle-quality, although it was relatively inexpensive for Philly.  The guacamole was very spicy, but that didn't mask that the avocados didn't taste fresh at all.  The tomatoes in the salsa were bland and mushy.  Won't be back.",

I called last night to see how long the wait was, and was told that there was no wait. So my friends and I drove all the way across town for dinner at 8 pm. As soon as we asked for a table, we were told that they were out of deep dish. What?! How does a restaurant run out of their signature menu item?! And how did the person who answered the phone fail to tell me that when I called to ask about the wait? I would have appreciated the warning and would probably have delayed my 312 dinner for one more day.   We love the deep dish pizza so much that we decided to stay and try the thin crust. It wasn't until after we ordered, though, that our waitress told us it would be an hour wait! We know that's the deal for the deep dish, but it was doubly disappointing to get to the restaurant, find out they don't have deep dish, and then have to wait an hour for the thin crust (which was okay, but would never have made it on my short list to hit before leaving town).  All in all, it was a disappointing night for what has been one of my favorite Nashville spots. Big bummer.  TL; DR:  call before you go and ask whether the restaurant is still serving deep dish because apparently 312 sometimes runs out of the crust.",

Maybe I'm not fully versed in the details of Chicago-style, but I was slightly disappointed in a few details.  First, however, the ambiance and service were great.  I arrived about 6pm on a Tuesday and found a place to park right on the street outside.  My waitress was charming and attentive, so no problems there.  I ordered a deep-dish 10\" cheese & pepperoni, expecting to eat half there and take the other half home.  My waitress warned me they take a while to cook - app. 45 minutes.  Which it did. Good thing I wasn't starving.  When the pizza came, there was plenty, but the sauce...oh, the sauce!  Tomato sauce dripping from every conceivable spot on the pizza, overwhelming the taste of the cheese and even the pepperoni.  And the crust was surprisingly hard, as if overdone.  But it was definitely thick with cheese and definitely filling.  I still have yet to eat my leftovers so my opinion may change slightly, but I doubt I'll be coming back.  Oh, and the price - $20 for a 10\" one-topping pizza.  I bit the bullet because it sounded so good, but my total bill was almost $30 and definitely not worth what I got.  UPDATE: Apologies for getting a couple of factual items incorrect.  I went back and re-looked at the online menu to get my facts straight.  It was indeed a 12\" pizza, and the price was $17.  With an iced tea, tax, and tip my total bill came to right about $30.  Probably not out of line, but less than satisfied with final product as indicated above.

We went on a Tuesday afternoon / evening for an early dinner before the Sounds game. They frequently have specials for sounds games and others so be sure you ask your server.  As far as atmosphere goes it reminded me more-so of a sports bar than a typical pizzeria but it wasn't a bad thing. Who knows, maybe all of the Chicago Pizzeria's are like this? Why Chicago? Cause that's where they're from and you can see all of the Chicago influenced memorabilia on the walls.  I've seen several pictures of the place and I can tell you its even smaller than it looks. By the time we got our food the dinner crowd was piling in and it was crowded. Our seats next to the window resulted in the maze we had to take if we needed to make it to the restroom.  Food: They have a variety of food selection on their menus but if you come to a place called 312 Pizza Company you kind've have to try the deep dish pizza. We ordered a pepperoni deep dish and as soon as we did our waitress let us know it would take anywhere from 30mins - 45mins for it to come out so we ordered an appetizer of wings.  The wings weren't special in the least bit. They weren't bad but they weren't amazing either.  As far as drinks go they have a few cocktails but we stuck to the beers. Of which they have an interesting selection of craft beers to choose from, local and non.  Our pie came out after about 30mins and we dug in. Word to the wise - let it cool. I usually hate it when people use forks to eat pizza unless of course its a deep dish. Which I would advise if you decided to go with it then definitely fork it up. As far as the crust goes it was probably one of the best crusts I have ever had on a deep dish. The tomato sauce was just the right amount on the pie - not so little that I was eating crust and not so much that I thought it was a lasagna. As far as the quality of the sauce goes - I've had better. Don't get me wrong it wasn't bad but I wasn't blown away by it. I was still enjoying how great the crust was and I'm not really a crust guy.  Service: Our waitress was very attentive. I've seen a couple of reviews where the service was lacking but our hostess and waitress were both great. After I finished my first beer she was back like a hawk ready to see if I wanted another. I switched to a can and it felt like she was back every time I took a drink out of it to see if I needed another. It could've been that the dinner crowd didn't show up yet, she was bored, or I come off as a raging alcoholic but I didn't mind.  Overall: I definitely see it as a great place for before / after the Sounds games. As far as pizza in Nashville goes its a definite must try. Would I go out of my way to come here? No not really.

They have an outdoor area with an indoor/outdoor bar separating the patio from the restaurant.   My go-to order at Anthony's Coal Fired is a large Proscuitto and Onion pizza with the proscuitto baked (they can either top the pizza with after it's cooked or bake the proscuitto with the rest of the pizza). The saltiness of the procsuitto mixed with the fresh parmesan cheese and saut\u00e9ed onions is the perfect combination. We split this between two people and always have a slice or two left over for breakfast the next day. If we only have one slice leftover, watch out.. it's a race to see who gets the last piece first!  Let's talk about the baked wings.... really, really, really good. I actually didn't get them for the first time last night and the first thing my boyfriend said to me was \"no wings?\". The wings are baked in the coal oven and have a great charcoal taste to them. They serve them with onions and focaccia bread which are equally as delicious.  Aside from the food being down right delicious, the service is always excellent for take out, dine in, or even if you're just sitting at the bar.",

We sat down in a very packed Tony Romas on a Saturday afternoon and we waited and waited for a server to come by. The place was really busy so we sort of understood, but it got to the point where we almost got up and left.  Finally, a very angry server stomped up and asked what we wanted to drink. No hello, no sorry, no eye contact. It was super uncomfortable. She pretty much forced us to make a decision on the spot about what we wanted to eat and after we ordered, she avoided us like the plague.  She had one large table half filled with kids and one of them asked for another milkshake. She was holding a bunch of dirty dishes and as he asked for the refill, she stormed over to the drink area right behind our table and THREW the dishes into the sink. It was so loud and it startled me. I can't imagine how the kids felt. How embarrassing.  After a mediocre meal and continued empty glasses we asked for the cheque- and the manager. All of a sudden, she was nice and said she would be happy to grab the manager for us.  Another server came up to the table and said that the manager was just on a phone call and she was a senior server and could talk to us. I was not buying it. I had seen the two servers chatting at some point during our horrible meal and assumed they were friends and she was now covering her friends butt.  Nevertheless, I told the problem to her in detail and she apologized. That was about it. No discount, no \"please come back\", no accountability.  The worst part about it was when we were walking to our car, we saw the manager standing outside with a group of servers smoking. \"On a phone call\"?  Right.  This place definitely lost our business.",

I've had better, mind you, but for a quick and reasonably priced lunch, it was nice. Plus, it's a convenient location (for me).  If you are in a hurry, you might want to call ahead and place an order to-go. It's a small space with limited seating, particularly at lunch. Also, if dining in, note that it's one of those places where you order at the counter, the server brings your food, and then you eat. They have a small, limited selection salad bar by the serve-yourself drink machine.  Overall, I wouldn't make the trip here if I had more time for lunch.

The bacon was NOT thick cut and the \"marinaded\" chicken tasted like it was salt and peppered...  The Diane Burger was the best thing I tried, and although not legendary, it was a solid burger and this is what I'd recommend out of the menu items I tried.  The pollo pesto panini was good (who the eff doesn't like chicken and pesto? if you don't... GTFO! jk) but was also average, nothing special about it.  The reasons I'd come back:  Their happy hour is what made this visit well worth it. Half off on appetizers as well as dollar off beers.

He then proceeded to try to list the 27 ingredients. I chalk it  up to he was young and new to the business, and really took to the whole chit-chat with customers bit a little too seriously. Once he got other tables things mellowed out and we really enjoyed ourselves.  Our daughter ordered off the kids menu, which is a set 3 course meal for $12. It truly was a bargain, and the staff took great care to make sure her order paired our food as far as the timing of things coming out. My husband and I each ordered the three plate deal. Honestly, there was so much food that I could only eat half of what I ordered. My husband, on the other hand, practically cleaned the plates.

My husband and I were craving yummy pizza so we came across Pizzeria Vetri and decided to try it out. We had a choice of either waiting 30 minutes for a table that would basically be shared with other people or eating at the pizza bar right away. I didn't mind watching the food get made. It was pretty cool in fact! We were offered sparkling or \"normal\" water and we chose the latter.  My husband and I couldn't find a pizza we both desired so we ordered two separate ones: the crudo and the salsiccia. We also ordered a Rotolo because every other table seemed to be ordering one and it looked delicious. To be honest, I think the Rotolo was my favorite perhaps because it was the first time I tried it.  Now back on topic, the pizza's were edible. Were they delicious? Eh. My husband and I don't exactly like vegetables. We never crave vegetables to be exact. However, while eating the pizza's here, we were both wishing we ordered a salad. I'm not sure how to explain it but the food wasn't exactly greasy but it felt that way. I wish they offered some pizza's that had meat and vegetables on them. For example, a Prosciutto pizza with spinach and cherry tomatoes. Now that sounds delicious!  The service was A-OK mostly due to being busy. We needed napkins but never got them. We also waited about five minutes for the check to come. The whole experience felt rushed because the restaurant was packed and busy.

The manager took it to recook the order - and brought back a piece of meat so rare it was cold in the center and tough. I was hungry, so I chomped my way through.  Another steak was over-cooked, a third plate was missing sour cream and butter for a potato, cold shrimp on a fourth, and almost raw (crunchy) vegetables on the fifth.  The manager (Cody) apologized when he took my plate, but never checked back to see if my issue was resolved and for us to tell him about the other problems at the table. When the check arrived - full price. No offer of a dessert for the issues, nothing off the bill.  We will not be back. Jesse's is just a bit up the road, and the quality of both the food and the service are head and shoulders above this Outback.  One shout-out - Kate was great in helping to resolve issues, but she was tied up training someone else and we didn't see her again.",

Great balance of sandwich, meat, and veggies. I came near the end of their lunch hour and got to speak with the owner just for a bit before they closed up. That really set the mood for me as we bonded over our love for great music and our travel between Orange County/LA and St. Louis.   Only urk was the amount of flies by the window.

I'm very bad with the names of pastries, but I can say that I definitely like the Guava turnover, bearclaw, almond croissant, and ham and cheese croissant.  I wish they had more savoury pastries, actually I wish they had more stuff in general and maybe sometimes change it up a bit.   I had in the past gotten used to a routine of getting up in the morning, grabbing a coffee and a pastry to eat before work. Later on in the day I would grab a loaf of bread that I would bring home to eat with dinner or as a snack for breakfast. I wish the bakery was open later, but unfortunately, none of the bakeries in New Orleans are open late, and by late, I mean past 1 or 2 pm.   That being said, the pastries and sweets are very good when they are fresh and I would give this place more stars if it wasn't for unpleasant experiences with some of the workers. I have been frequenting Maple Street Patisserie for over a year now and on several occasions I have been treated very rudely by the workers who are frequently impatient, even when there's no one else in the store, or they act angry as they take the pastry out of the window and shove it onto the plate.  At other times, the workers are actually pretty nice.  So please, if you're having a bad day, don't take it out on the customers.

But sadly, there are better places to get donuts (Suzy Jo's in Blue Bell) and Korean chicken (Cafe Soho).  The chicken wings were moist, but insanely salty...  and I love my food salty, so for me to notice it is saying something.  I ordered half plain and half chili, and the chili sauce made the wings really slimy and they completely lost their crunch (good Korean style fried chicken can still stay crunchy under the sauce).  Their hot donuts are pretty darn tasty, I'd choose them over the specialty ones.  If I were to pick one donut of theirs that was stellar, it would be the strawberry lavender (had it at their Rittenhouse location).  Hot out of the fryer and bursting with flavor, it was a nice snack.  I'd have that again.  The only reason I'm not giving them 2 stars is because the staff are super nice.

They looked perfect when they came out, well pressed and the bread was outstanding.   Only thing wrong, they forgot the pork.  Went back to mamacita and showed her. She moved the ham, lettuce, pickle, and cheese and sure enough there was one slice of pork underneath.  I didn't know you could slice pork that thin. I'm glad she found the pork because when you looked through it you could see the one slice of salami underneath.  Still, you shouldn't need a map and local guide to find everything in a sandwich.  Then she gives me the \"whatsamattayou\" face.  The second Cuban  was the same.  No mistake.      I hate to run down what seemed like a family run business.  Maybe other things on the menu are good.  Stay clear of this place if you are looking for a good Cuban.        Better yet, walk down to Nicahabana Cigars on 7th Ave. and watch them roll.  Go in, sit at the bar, have a cigar and watch real craftsmen work.  Cheap thrills for me.",

    "text": "I have been to Gullifty's before for the karaoke before I was 21 and with a bunch of friends we would stay and eat and sing.   As of last night I will not be returning due to he unprofessional staff and rude confrontations that I had to go through with them.   We arrived a little after 10pm, waited for someone to sit us, we were sat in the bar area for a 4 top table by who I assumed was the hostess. Our server came, took our drink order and when someone wanted to order a draft we all had to pull out our ID's, which is fine. Whatever. The server informed us, as someone was under 21 at our table, that we could not drink out our table with them being underaged, so we decided to order our meals and us 21+ would go drink at the bar and come back. We get our meals, start to eat, and me and another guest from our table go to the bar to drink.   We finished what we were drinking at the bar and paid our tab, went back over to our table to continue to eat and our server came to our table and confronted us, it was around 11:00pm, he continued to explain about the law about drinking at a table with someone underage, blatantly ignoring our friend, and how it was just the law [which we understood, and which is why we drank at THE BAR, away from him] and our server explained to us how \"It was starting to get busy and that because we had someone underaged we could finish our meal\" basically telling us that he wanted the table.   I was very irritated by the server, this was rude, we hadn't been there for an hour, our meals were cold when we received them, and he wanted to get rid of us?! Seriously? NO ONE had walked into the door after this confrontation, and I KNOW because I watched the time on my phone because i hadn't seen many people come in at ALL it was a Wednesday NIGHT!   Again, 2 from our table went up to the bar to drink, I stayed with our underaged friend. We sorted out our money for the check. The server CONTINUOUSLY passed our table after our money was ready, avoiding us, un-attentive to anything. He comes back apologizing to me and AGAIN paying no attention showing sympathy to our friend. He is apologizing for the law, I don't care. I know the law. I am upset he wanted us to leave, we WERE SAT IN THE BAR AREA BY STAFF i told him, and that's not my fault. I became very upset.   After this I decide let's give this server the table so he can get over it, me and the friend under 21 sit furthest away from the bar and look for songs to sing for karaoke. At this point I am now being bothered by the Manager. Explaining to me that the kitchen closes in 4 minutes and that since we've eaten he can no longer JUSTIFY our friend being there. I'm Sorry, didn't know this was Gullifty's BAR. Our friend waited outside, not being able to even participate in the karaoke because of the continuous disruptions from staff and the rudeness that came with them.   Train your staff and put some signs up about the 21+ after midnight for karaoke. I will NEVER be going back. I'd rather set fire to my money.",

It was really dry and not much flavor, there wasn't much of the special sauce on the burger to begin with and I think if there was more it would've tasted better. My friend got the Philly Steak and said it was pretty good. We shared the sweet potato fries with the sriracha ailoi which was really good! Space is very limited for seats and my friend sitting on the shared bench was being moved every someone got up or sat down, kind of annoying. The staffed seemed nice but kind of impatient. Overall it was alright. If I come again I'll get something else since the burger just wasn't good and maybe I'll have a better opinion about the food.

    "text": "It pains me to write this review since the previous dozen or so times I'my boyfriend and I have been to Tzin for date nights, it was always enjoyable, cozy and the servers really made us feel special, however, this past weekend, my boyfriend and I had our least favourite dining experience there and that really made us both question if we want to return in the near future.   It's true when they say customer service either makes or breaks an experience. When we first started going to Tzin about two years ago, we were blessed with two excellent servers - Kerrie & Mel... they alone made us want to come back because they made us laugh and were so enthusiastic about the experience and the food. However, about a year ago, Mel left to pursue other endeavours, but we were left in the capable hands of Kerrie (who is also the owner). She has always been friendly, sweet and super pleasant. Re-hired was a former male server from the past. The last few times we've dined there we luckily had Kerrie has our server so my boyfriend and I were happy about that. However, this past Saturday, upon arrival, we were surprised to see that Kerrie was not there, and instead, there was the regular male server from previous times plus another gentleman serving the room. We were greeted promptly and asked if we had reservations (which we did). There were two free tables, for two, at the time - one right near the entrance, and the other in the middle of the room. He immediately pointed to the table right near the entrance for us to sit. We obviously preferred to sit closer inside since it was -30 outside and there isn't much of a barrier between the outside door and inside. I therefore had to ask if we could sit at the other table instead. Instead of agreeing to it, we had to wait until the server asked the other gentleman for permission (which I thought weird since they were both tables for 2). Anyways, that's fine. We got our table in the middle and were seated promptly but missing a menu until my boyfriend had to ask for me. It's around this point that I really started feeling like this date night wasn't going to be the same as others and my boyfriend said he was just thinking the same thing. The server wasn't warm and genuine in his greeting, didn't even ask how we were doing, just wanted to see if we were ready to make our order. Throughout the night, I noticed the same lack of personal attentiveness - for instance, in the past with the girls, usually when the dish is placed on the table, it is described in delicious detail - this time nothing was described except for the three different sauces accompanying the chorizo. Also, our server never once checked up on us after the first few bites, to see how our food was. Incidentally, we ordered three of our favourite dishes and they are all usually very good, but this time round, the potato bravas was seriously lacking in depth - a certain smokiness that we've tasted in the past was not there and all the flavours felt disconjointed like they didn't have time to meld together. The bacon and the chorizo we ordered were very good. All-in-all, my boyfriend and I commented on how cold and inpersonal it felt, even though the space is small and warm. We actually finished our food and drink, didn't linger to have dessert like usual, because that's how disappointed we were with the night's experience. In fact, our date lasted a grand total of 1 hour from start to finish. So much for a lovely evening out.  Please note, the price for food here is a steep, albeit good, compared to the portion sizes. For instance, we ordered the \"potato bravas\" which was $14.50 for literally two small handfuls of chopped potatoes with bits of bacon, covered in a tomato sauce and topped with green onion. The \"bacon\" dish  was $16 for 3 bite-size pieces of pork belly on crostini. And the \"grilled chorizo sausage\" was $15 for maybe a 20 cm long piece of sausage.",

I went there based upon the 4.5 star review hoping for a great little sandwich place in the Metairie side of town. The grocery store looked pretty great, but the sandwich bar on a Saturday at lunchtime was abysmal, and the worst place I've paid money to eat since moving here several weeks ago.   The service consisted of \"What do you want?\" followed by the staff contuing their conversation and offering no help at all. The turkey sandwich my wife bought was shaved lettice and tomato on a plain white hamburger bun. Hardly worth the $7 we paid. My \"hot sausage po boy\" was some kind of pressed mass of orange meat with more shredded \"lettuce\".  The only redeemable thing about the whole meal was the package of cole slaw that made it edible. If you're looking for a grocery store, definitely check it out; but if you're looking for a sandwich or a po boy, pass it by. It's an amateurish half-hearted attempt.",

    "text": "I've been wanting to come here for quite sometime and I finally dragged the boyfriend here for dinner tonight. Upon entering, i noticed the decor was quite modern and clean in appearance, but felt very crowded as they were trying to fit too many tables into a small space. I looked up the menu online before hand to get an idea of what they offer. They had a variety of options including all you can eat sushi and hibachi (17.95 for adults) or you can order a la carte for various maki and signature rolls as well as hibachi, apps, teriyaki, etc. However, when we were seated they only gave us the all you can eat menu. I chose to walk out as I knew I could not eat enough to make it worth the money on this particular evening. That's when they informed me that they had an a la carte menu. I wish they had presented it up front upon seating us, seemed like they want people to just order from the unlimited menu, so they hide the ala carte menu behind the hostess stand.   Regardless, we decided to stay and give it a shot. The prices were very reasonable for the a la carte ($3-4 for plain and simple rolls, $8-10 for signature), but it was reflected in the quality and presentation of the food to a certain extent. We chose the Mexican, California, spicy tuna and rock 'n roll. All were good in my opinion except the spicy tuna which was the most boring roll of my life (even more yawn worthy than California). Normally a spicy tuna has some extra toppings or pizzazz on top, but this was totally plain. Meh. It was also a bit mushy. Not good for someone like myself who enjoys crunchy and crispy sushi. Besides that all other rolls were decent. The BF doesn't eat sushi often, but can appreciate it once in a while. He thought this sushi was 3/10, based on the thick double layer of rice on each roll as well as simplicity of some of the rolls. In my opinion it was more like a 6/10, hence my \"A-OK\" 3 star review.  Overall, the concept is good for those who can eat, eat and eat some more. However for those with a smaller appetite it would be better to order a la carte if you can't eat at least 3 rolls. I will likely give it another chance in the future, perhaps to try their 3 rolls lunch combo for $9.99 or maybe to try some of the hibachi.",

The shrimp appetizer ($6) set the bar low for the evening...four scrawny shrimp were overcooked to the point of being tough and stringy, and coated with a sweet sauce in a vain attempt to dress it up. The futomaki roll was flavorless and the pickled radish was hard. Almost made me glad there were only 5 pieces in that roll! The beef teriyaki bento box ($18) sounded like a good deal, but the food arrived lukewarm to cold and lacked in flavor.   In addition, the atmosphere inside is really off-putting. The dining space is furnished with shiny black chairs and tables and dimly lit by wall lighting that changes color. There are small tables crowded together on each side of the narrow restaurant space, so our attempts to converse were thwarted by loud customers next to us.

When I tried to send mine back for a baked potato I was told that they don't serve baked potatoes on Sunday. I also wanted creamed horseradish and was informed that they might possibly be out of that as well, so I asked for sour cream to mix with the straight horseradish. By this time the bartender (subbing as a waitress) was becoming visibly agitated with my persistent requests.  I was planning to order 2 additional prime rib dinners to take home to my husband and son-in-law, but I wasn't about to give this place any more money for their poor choices and now an attitude from a food server.

There was only one item on the menu that we thought we could eat, a vegetarian ramen bowl.  We asked the waiter if we could get gluten free noodles and he said yes so we ordered two of the same for ourselves.  When the bowls arrived a different server said they were not gluten free as the broth was very cloudy.  The person who took our order neglected to tell us the broth was made with wheat and there was nothing else on the menu she could eat, everything had meat or wheat in it.  My wife rejected the order and I ate mine.  Wife had nothing to eat and had to sit there watching me eat mine.    I find it amazing that in a restaurant that advertises itself as selling Japanese food doesn't have any Japanese dishes without meat or wheat.  Japan is or was a rice based food culture with many dishes without meat or fish.  All I can figure is Raijin thinks all Americans want meat and wheat so they design their menu accordingly.  Yoshimatsu restaurant on Campbell Ave. sells many meat and wheat free dishes.    Raijin is also overpriced for what you get.  Yoshimatsu is cheaper with a lot more variety in the dishes especially ramen dishes.  We ate a a ramen restaurant in downtown San Diego recently that served vegan and gluten free ramen bowls.  I hope Raijin reads this and changes their menu because my ramen bowl was very good with the added garlic hot mixture I ordered as a side and put into my bowl.

The large head-on shrimp are simmered in a rich sauce of butter, Worcestershire sauce and Creole seasoning and served with French bread. The flavor in this dish is beyond incredible, and after the shrimp are all eaten I'm sopping up every last bit of sauce with the bread.

    "text": "This review pertains only to Saigon market, I will save the Restaurant for another review.  This is probably my least favorite Asian Market in town and probably Asian for that matter.  But they have two benefits that earn a visit from me every now and then.    Even though they have a very limited fresh meat selection but it is definitely the best out of all the Asian market.  You won't find rib eyes or filet mignon here, but more rustic cut such as pork belly, pork shoulder, beef shank, beef loin, and innards.  The second benefit is the one male worker, i think he's the butcher, stocking boy, and cleaner.  He's pretty fast when it comes to helping you with the meat.  If i needed him to cut the meat and bones a certain way, he'll be on it.  His English isn't very good but I think he can make out keyword and can help you find what you are looking for.   Their vegetable selection is limited and caters to Asian cooking.  Out of all the Asian market on Lafayette Road, Saigon has the worst vegetables!   They always look like they are dead or near dead.   The herbs in the refrigerated section is not too bad though and usually pretty fresh.  If you are wanting to buy vegetables though, I say skip Saigon and go to Saraga or Oriental market.   Saigon has a similar selection of dried goods and frozen items like Van's Fish Market.   Check expiration dates especially on canned goods and I would be careful of frozen items as well.  I always make sure I do a thorough examination.    Saigon also sells freshly made bake goods and exotic fruits, and you can find them scatter up by the register.  The owner usually stands behind the register, she usually doesn't say anything to any of the shopper unless she knows them.  I wish she would be more cheery because it kinda ruins my shopping mood because I enjoy grocery shopping.  Overall, Saigon would be a MEH experience but the fresh meat selection earns this place another star.",

The bar staff in my experience didn't care about the beer they were serving.  Glasses were ice cold and the bartender who served us was high.

I don't know where they were running to, since we didn't see our server almost the entire meal. The bread they bring for the table is rubbery (you could buy better at Acme!!) and served with the worst quality olive oil; they should be embarrassed, as an Italian restaurant. The pasta on the specials menu was tough, and the menu is WAAAY over-priced for the portions and quality they're serving. God help you if you order that $20 (!!) glass of Chardonnay...

After driving by this location on Dale Mabry multiple times, and laughing at the coincidence of a pizza place using the same name as my favorite place in MD, I looked it up online and realized it IS the same place.  Woo hoo!  I've been here three times now, and the pizza is just like I remembered, and just as good as I hoped it would be.  To start with - the pizza is square, and the pieces are cut into little squares.  It's thin crust, which is my favorite kind of pizza, as I hate filling up on dough.  The red sauce is sweet, and very distinctive.  I've tried all different varieties of pizza here, but I always come back to the classic pepperoni pizza.  Each individual square piece of pizza gets it own thick cut slice of pepperoni on top.  Heaven!  Then, before you know it, you've eaten multiple squares, and you roll out the door, fat and happy.  Service was good, waitress was friendly, and stopped by frequently to make sure we had what we needed.

I filled my bowl headed to the register and I said I just wanted one bowl. The almost impossible to hear cashier/waitress said only the all you can eat option is available after 4pm. I told her I don't want that and she said she'd give me a box for my second bowl. $14.50 with no drink plus they wanted a tip.  After I ate my first bowl, I had my second bowl made and had a few bites. I was ready for my box. The other almost silent waitress, suddenly very audible, said I couldn't have one it was against policy. I told her what the other girl said and she told me that was \"impossible\" because the girl knew better and had worked there a very long time.

First off, good luck finding the shop. I knew exactly where it was supposed to be based on GPS, but I overlooked the place twice due to poor signage and ended up driving around that same building twice and then wandered further around to a different section of Westhaven before finally seeing a sign for it!  I feel the drink menu (coffee and espresso) is a little limited. They do have different food options including baked goods, biscuits, and even ice cream. It was after I had ordered and paid for my mocha that I found the muffins wrapped and stored on a centerpiece server on the middle of the big table where patrons were sitting. So I went back and grabbed one and paid separately. My mocha was on par. The muffin was just not very appetizing. The service was fine, but they didn't go out of their way to smile or make you feel welcomed.  Oh yeah, my lid came off my drink twice, but fortunately it did not result in a major spill.

I am going to go ahead and say right now that Trace does not know he lended his name to this sorry excuse for catfish. I made my selections and closed the menu, a clear signal to any waiter that an order is ready to be taken. Literally four pass by's later I let Fred know that I was ready to order. I did and the food took a little longer to come than what I had hoped but not obnoxiously long...but my beer was dry and I pushed it the edge of the counter and Fred just kept waking by. After I got his attention, he refilled my beer. Two seats down from me, same deal, another guy had to get Fred's attention to get him another beer. My food came and the portion was not small but not huge either...I had been driving for 9.hours with just a small bag of beef jerky and peanuts so I was famished. I also got the coleslaw, fries and broccoli with cheese. The coleslaw was clearly old, the fries were a tad soggy and the cheese on the broccoli was...gritty? All in all the meal was just right at average. The total bill was $23 and if it had been higher I would have possibly complained but clearly here, you get what you pay for. When I was done, once again I had to grab Fred's attention. When I got my bill, I paid and Fred was actually quick to close me out. So, he was quick to greet and quick to close out but in between he could use some help. I don't think I will be back tomorrow night as I am in town for two nights. The beer prices are reasonable though.",

The bread is soft on the inside and crunchy on the outside, the filling is pretty good and they have some cool combinations. Surf and turf was a good pick for sure.  Boudin balls were ok. Gumbo was tolerable.  Fries with cheese and debris was worth ordering, but I've had better gravy. Sweet potato fries were soggy and gross, sadly.  Ribs were fall off the bone but don't have much flavor. Brisket was also very soft but it was sliced wrong so it didn't have he right consistency and the sauce that comes with the BBQ didn't blow me away either. Hard to get good BBQ outside of Texas so if you don't know any better it probably leaves a better impression.  And there was a wait for some reason.

    "text": "I purchased a Groupon for a night stay here in a Jr. Suite & the room was 50% off & ran $200 with the discount.  I was already heading to TN to visit some family so my mom & I decided to use the Groupon the night before I left so we'd be close to the airport.  We had both been to the hotel in the past (prior to the flood) and thought it was so gorgeous & we couldn't wait to actually stay here & see what the room would look like.  According to their website we were in for a real treat in our room but when we arrived that wasn't the case at all.    First off, their parking has gone up & is now $18 per night to park in a lot that doesn't shuttle you & your luggage to the main hotel, you have to walk.  If you choose to valet the cost is $24 per night which I have a huge issue with...the parking is outside in their own lot, this is not a major city like NYC where parking is limited so I feel that charging people to park & walk is a bit ridiculous, I can see charging $5/10 for valet but charging me to park my own car & shlep my own bags is a slap in the face especially considering the room rates.  How are locals supposed to be patrons to the businesses inside if they have to pay that much just to park?    The hotel itself if gorgeous but the room was pretty boring...it was a large single room with a 4 person dining table & 2 armchairs, it was not at all what was explained on their website which indicated \"Our suites include a moderate-size living room and optional connecting bedrooms with endless possibilities for entertaining or for small corporate meetings\".  This led me to believe that we wouldn't be sleeping in the moderate sized living room & have no bedroom at all.  At no time during booking or check in was I asked how many beds I wanted & since I thought our suite had bedroom(s) I didn't ask & when we got to the room we had 1 king.  I called down to the front desk first to ask why we were put in a standard room & why it only had 1 bed & I was told \"our Jr. suite is just 1 large room & you should have specified when asked how many beds you wanted\" I replied \"I was never asked during booking or check in what I wanted\" I was then told \"well, if you want to change to 2 beds I can transfer you to the front desk & you can see if they have anything available\" and I said \"no, I don't want the hassle I guess we can just share the bed\" and was told \"OK, sorry you are disappointed\".  The guest services person didn't offer to find out the 2 bed availability for me, she didn't offer to move us to a garden view room (which is still cheaper at its standard rate than the discounted rate we paid for the suite) or offer any other solutions either & I was really disappointed with that.  Once we got over the disappointment of our room we got dressed & hit the hotel to shop, eat, cocktail & check out the murals & water shows.  First off we tried to find the water show & weren't having any luck so we proceeded to shop & asked the woman working in one of the stores where we could find them & she said \"oh, they aren't running tonight\" so that was disappointing but we moved on to exploring the murals when we were then asked by a lovely gentleman to leave because of an event that was going on behind the closed doors of the area we were in.  After a couple hours of being at the hotel we were 0 for 4 so we decided to start drinking...we hit up Fuse & each had 1 drink & our bill was $19 so we moved on to dinner at Jack Daniels which was so good & reasonable priced.  I think our total bill was under $40 & we didn't have any drinks but we did have leftovers!!  After dinner there was nothing left to do so we went back to the room for some shut eye which was great until we got the luxury of listening to our neighbors have sex.  After all of that I took an Ambien & slept really well until about  7 am when I could hear people talking in the hallway & room doors closing one after the other.  My mom said she slept for s**t because of all of the noise & it was a shame too because the bed was so comfortable.    I'm sure that if everything we wanted to see & do would have been available to us this wouldn't have seemed like such a let down & the boring room wouldn't have been that big of a deal but considering that we weren't able to do anything that was on our list I would be hesitant to stay here again unless we had an atrium room so we could at least sit on the balcony & people watch.    Don't get me wrong, the lush greenery & the beautiful architecture as well as the shopping & food are all amazing but as a guest I left feeling pretty let down.",

While we were there, most of them were there to purchase the food to go, so the seats were not in high demand.  Even though this is mainly a donut shop, they also offer enticing fried chicken. We ordered their very popular Fried Chicken Sandwich, available from 11am. It was smaller than I thought it would be, but I always take quality over quantity. It was juicy, tasty, with a nice little kick to it. We really enjoyed it!  We couldn't just order chicken from a donuts shop, so we got a couple of donuts from their Hot Donuts selections.
