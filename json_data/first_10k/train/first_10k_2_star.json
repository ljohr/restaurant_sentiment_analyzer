    "text": "Is it possible out of the eight dishes we ordered, six were awful?? Where to start...? \n\"Kobe\" sliders?? Tasted like chunky dirt.  Onions and greasy bun were good. My salmon (maybe my fault for ordering salmon in a burger joint) tasted and smelled like five-day old bad fish.  The server graciously replaced it with a rubbery piece of chicken then announced in a hushed tone he wasn't charging me for the salmon.  The bed of lettuce the salmon was resting on was filled with watery, wilted greens, sort of like when you leave a bag of spinach in the refrigerator for two weeks.  My husband's french fries were completely burnt; but the others at the table who had properly cooked french fries found them pretty good. \nNext, The Mediterranean flatbread, which had artichokes that somehow tasted like fish, was soggy and mostly consisted of bread and raw onions.\nLastly, and best of all, while we were there celebrating a birthday. I quietly asked the waiter if he could bring out a cheesecake with a candle and we would all sing.  Sitting with a table full of dishes and spilled food, we see a food runner arrive with a piece of cheesecake (no candle): \"Who gets the cheesecake?\"  Not quite the birthday surprise we were going for. \nMy generous two-star rating is from our table's beer drinkers who liked the variety of beers.  Oh, and the friendly waiter.",

    "text": "I will preface this review with the fact that I was once a die-hard fan of Oakley's Bistro.  Every special occasion we spent in Indianapolis was completed with dinner at Oakley's.\n\nHowever, my last visit was just that:  my last.\n\nThis started the night before New Year's Eve, or December 30th.  We called to make a reservation and were told the only available seating time was at 9:00.  While this was rather late, we figured they were busy and made the reservation.  \n\nWe were greeted and seated quickly and were soon met by our nemesis...the server who can only be described as a clone of Anne Robinson, the stone-faced host of \"The Weakest Link.\"  While she is generally pleasant enough, we found that other guests were met with smiles while we were not so fortunate.\n\nThe meal was absolutely delicious, as is customary at Oakleys.  However, we did find it odd that we were only one of three tables dining at that time.  When we questioned the hostess, she mentioned that there was no restriction on the reservation times for that night.  Very odd.\n\nWhile enjoying our cocktails, we noticed the owner standing near his Kitchen booth entertaining someone obviously more important than we.  While this type of behavior is common, in a restaurant with so few patrons, is it not customary, or at least slightly polite, to introduce one's self and thank the guest?\n\nTo top the night off, the three of us ordered dessert.  We shared two wonderful creations, delivered by the assistant manager.  As she placed the plates down, she said \"I hope those look alright...I've never made them before.  The kitchen staff left for the evening.\"\n\nI think the service on this occasion finally caused our love of Oakleys to perish.  While once a favored restaurant, the service had never been one of its strong points and put the final nail in the coffin of our relationship.\n\nI would much rather take my business to a restaurant with more changes in the menu, better staff and a friendlier proprietor.",

I'm not sure what happened Bc I planned the dinner and was so excited to take the fam there but I certainly won't be back. The apps we got were mozz sticks and avocado rolls. Mozz sticks were cold.

Cons: the food was mediocre, but really pricey.  I got the duck enchiladas which were perfectly average, nothing special.  My guy got the puntas de filet mignon.  Very spicy and severely lacking in flavor.  He loves everything spicy, but with nothing but spice, what's the point?  My main problem was the service.  I cannot stand when I feel like I'm not being paid attention to because of how young I am or the amount in our party (servers are notoriously bad at checking on a 2 top).  The crowd here was mostly 40's-50's..I'm 25.  Our waitress never checked on us, left us without drinks, and generally didn't seem to care.  But she seemed to love the 6 top next to us.",

You guys are lucky that I was starving and it was at least another 2 hours before my plane would even start boarding so one slice and drink set me back about 12 bucks.\n\nThe slice that I got was a combo which had sausage, onions, green peppers, and olives. They throw it in the oven for about a minute or two to heat it up. Not the best pizza but i have also had worse. The end crust was pretty thick almost to the point that it was a breadstick. I asked if I could get some pizza sauce on the side to dip it in and was ready to pay because hay, its the airport where they gouge you on pretty much everything. To my surprise, they didnt charge me. I guess nice workers do exist at airports. Unfortunately, this was the only positive highlight. \n\nOverall, I dont think I will eat at this place again any time soon. I can more than afford to lose a few pounds or 20. Put something with actual garlic on the menu and maybe we can talk about dining here.\n\nYelp 2016 Review #12 \"Vampires dont worry about this place. There's no garlic here\"\n585 overall",

While I was waiting, I heard the microwave go off n thought ohh ooo (not a good sign). So I got my order in a timely matter. Got home n saw that they \"shemered\" what either was sour cream or mayo all over the top of my chimichanga n on top of the white condiment, a whole bunch of lettuce n tomato (id like to see what Im eating, not for it to be covered up like its hiding something). The entree came w two sides. There was a side of rice n beans. I'm not a bean person but the beans were pretty good. The flavor of the rice was good but it was not evenly cooked. The chimichanga it self was sub par, not a lot of meat compared to other places I've eaten at. The meat that i did get, was charred w burnt pieces. After scraping off the top of the chimichanga, you could see that there wasn't much wrapped inside. I probably won't be going back n I'll be sticking to my usual Mexican restaurant.",

    "text": "Party of 6 early on a Saturday night, 5pm, or first time in Reno.  Venue looks very promising from the outside, with outdoor seating and an upscale appeal. We were seated immediately, but as soon as we turned the corner from the hostess station, the place was a turnoff. A bit too loudly playing music, but the mostly twenties crowd seemed not to mind it\n\nOur table surface reeked of sour dishrags, very off-putting.  We ordered drinks, took a while, the sangria looked like a blush wine and did not taste like sangria.\n\nOur waitress was pleasant but detached, no interest in boosting our experience or displaying a personality, the smile and pleasantries seemed forced.  We ordered 2 appetizers: onion rings and nachos.  They were served pretty quickly but we were not provided with plates, which made for a messier experience than it should have.  Curiously, the check noted \"no plates\" for the apps and we were perplexed by this. \n\nThe entrees were just okay. Nobody was thrilled but it was all edible.  The burrito came with chips and salsa, according to the menu, but no salsa was served. When questioned,  the waitress said the salsa was inside the burrito.  Oh, okay a pile of chips but nothing to dip them in.  We asked for boxes for leftovers which were provided, but no bag for carrying them.\n\nAll told, we had enough to eat but once we left we had to laugh because we had ALL wanted to leave when we were seated but nobody spoke up. Generally disappointed, in large part because we all liked the outside look of the venue but the experience didn't deliver.",

My boyfriend and I decided to stop there for a lunch date and aside from the nice waitress it was awful. The menu had the most random choices and nothing really stood out. I ordered the calamari as an appetizer and there was barely any and you could smell the fishyness from a mile away. It was rubbery as well- barely touched it. My boyfriend ordered the pretzels which were pretty good, but insanely greasy. I was in the mood for a salad so I ordered the steak fajita salad. when it came out I could already tell it was going back. it was saturated in dressing, french fries thrown on top (thought they would be on the side) and the steak was green on the outside and grey on the inside!!! The green part I figured out was marinade, but when I opened it up there was no pink only grey and it smelt old and disgusting. when I picked up the lettuce the dressing was dripping off of it! I immediately sent it back and the waitress was very apologetic. I was so hungry that I ordered the Penne vodka which was halfway decent. It's a shame because the atmosphere is great inside but the food was horrendous. Never again.",

Oh well ... my review covers them both:\n\nIt is sad but seemingly true that this place has survived for years on the overflow traffic from some of the other places at John's Pass. Tired of the wait at Bubba Gump? Not in the mood for pizza from Delosa's? Just realized that you paid for parking and that Walt'z has closed for the day - plus your feet hurt from a day at the beach ... stop for a while at Sculley's and take what they serve you. If you can find a server, that is. \n\nActually, the service isn't that bad ... the problem is with the layout of the place. The shops here want to have an eclectic air, as though they were built from driftwood and shipping crates held together with sail cloth and rope. This is fine in fantasy, but in reality does not make it easy for the wait staff to get around easily of remain within eye sight of their tables. \n\nThe food is passable, but unexceptional. Being a stone throw away from Gulf of Mexico means that a restaurant can lean towards basic tourist fare (they likely won't know how boring it is) and get away with it. Locals tend to shy away from such places, unless they are entertaining out-of-townees who believe boat drinks and breezes are more important than fine dining.",

I understand that this place was destroyed by the 2010 Cumberland River flood, and that it was recently rebuilt. It looks great, and is in a great location, right on the river, although a bit off the beaten path. The place was practically empty at a time when it should have been really busy. That should have been our first clue that all was not well. The food was practically inedible, and our server, while she didn't say it, seemed to be embarrassed to serve it. \n\nWhat the owners of so many restaurants fail to understand is that we go to restaurants first for the FOOD, not the decor or the view. If you don't get the food part right, everything else was a waste of money. For a fraction of the price of the decor you can hire a good, solid executive chef who can turn out some amazing food that will bring customers back again and again.

    "text": "Apparently I'm a glutton for punishment because I've had multiple bad experiences here. My favorite was having the chef that was terminated in the middle of preparing our meal. He lost it, yelling at what I assume was his boss, throwing things,waving the knife around and loudly complaining the rest of the time until he stormed out. Needless to say, everyone at my table was pretty scared of the knife-wielding crazy chef. Management did not come by to apologize, and when we brought up the situation they acted like it was a normal everyday thing. One of the others at my table complained loudly and was told that she would \"do us a favor\" and take off 15%. \n\nAlso getting to-go orders and ordering \"no onions\" is confusing, as my order has been messed up the last two times I've gone.",

My girlfriend and I met up for dinner and drinks. The service was ok but once we got the bill it was triple what we ordered.  When I questioned the waitress she brought over the manager who basically called us liars. He was completely nasty and rude and did not at all handle the situation as I would have expected.

    "text": "Not the experience we had hoped for. We were on a family vacation from Arkansas as this is one of the closest locations to us. The menu was confusing as they have fresh fish on the menu but if it does not have a checkmark beside it they do not currently have it. I wanted halibut but there was no checkmark. So I asked the waitress for a recommendation. She recommended the snapper dish. So I ordered that. Then the server came back to tell me the snapper was still frozen solid. The chef recommended I get the red fish but I did not want that. So I got the swordfish.  It was good but I was disappointed.  The waitress was friendly and took good care of us. I said well get me a discount since you didn't have what I wanted. No discount and no manager came out to apologize for not having dishes ready to go for a Friday lunch. We will probably come back but are disappointed in this trip to one of our favorite restaurants. You would think they would have better customer service and have all menu items prepped for the weekend!",

    "text": "Yes, only two stars and the food is actually very good. The bad is the same as the other reviewers here: they seem to skimp or ration food and serve dishes with very little \"there\" there. Just like other reviewers we had the experience of ordering the yummy Salume plate with two types of sliced meat, a potted pork, mustard and another spreadable meat and only two slices of bread!! Only two! When we asked for just one slice of bread to eat the spreads, we were told: No. The chef says you can buy a whole plate of bread, but you cannot have one slice. What???  \n\nThis negative experience colored our meal. We let it go of course, and enjoyed our meal but afterwards when discussing our experience the stupid bread thing is what came up. Very short sighted Ava. \n\nAlso, our mussel pasta dish may have had 3 to 5 mussels on a large bowl of noodles. The beet salad was beet in name only. After dinner we all thought the others ate the beets. I doubt we had but 2 pieces. At 7:20 they had run out of all fish. They must have been short on bread too because that was as rare and valuable as diamonds. Too bad. \n\nThe atmosphere wonderful, the food tasty,  and the service pretty good for a new restaurant, but It seems like the management is high on a new restaurant buzz, the bread-stingy chef seems arrogant and is forgetting that the novelty will soon wear off and they will need to earn repeat business. The food is good, but not exceptional in a town with great food. For the best pasta in town try La Terrazza in Ybor City. Five stars here on yelp, a fraction of the price and the cute little Italian owner will give you all the bread you want to sop up the delicious sauce.\n\nAva management: if you read this please know that I'm rooting for you. I want you to succeed and fulfill your promise and potential. The food is yummy but you have work to do on customer experience. Mine is only one voice of many here trying to tell you the same thing. This is tough love. \n\nDiners: when you make a reservation demand extra bread or hang up. They will get the message.",

Previously, I came mostly for the fried clam strips as they're hard to find in Tucson but so delicious. Found out they don't serve them any longer so I decided to try the crab cakes. They were basically two balls of mushy breadcrumbs lacking in flavor I think I had about 3 chunks of crab. Service was extremely slow.  The restaurant got busy shortly after I arrived and I thought since I was the second person in the restaurant and I didn't have a complicated order I would be served quickly but that was not the case, several people that came in after me were served before me. Waitress was just ok.. not super friendly. Overall, not a very positive experience so I have no reason to come back.",

I would order the sandwich again but ask for it not to be heated at all. I ordered the potato with butter, green onions and sour cream. Unfortunately, all I got was a potato with onions. No sour cream and no butter, which made for a very dry side dish. I ate half then threw the rest away because dry potatoes don't taste that great.

    "text": "We ate here expecting a lot because of the reviews. We got mozzarella sticks, eggplant fries, and a pizza. The mozzarella sticks weren't hot, the cheese inside wasn't melty. The eggplant fries were fine. The pizza was an overcooked mess. The spinach seemed like frozen chopped spinach that had been freezerburned; it didn't cook down like spinach should but just got super dry and had a weird smell. The crust was really hard and tough. I see a lot of people saying the crust is crunchy here. I like a nice crunchy pizza crust-- I really do. But this pizza crust was incredibly hard and I could barley saw through it with a knife and with TMJ issues I couldn't bite through it at all. We said something to the waitress and she told us that was how it was supposed to be, and if we didn't want it hard we could order it less cooked and have it come out \"partly raw\" next time. Those were her words, I'm not even kidding. I told her that I would prefer fully cooked dough. They gave us $5 off our uneaten pizza. We had taken a few slices and picked at them hoping for edible parts but if we had reassembled everything on the pan we'd have eaten less than two full slices total. I ended up paying $40 including tip for a meal where basically only one appetizer was decent. I am also just shocked at the service we received when I nicely complained about the pizza. Please, please don't tell more customers that if they don't want hard, overcooked dough they should ask for it raw! That's absurd.",

I pointed that out to the server and received a new burger after a little wait. The replacement was soaked in blood, just plain raw meat inside...

Unfortunately, that's it. \n\nWith all the good reviews, my expectations were high. It was a hot day and it was lunch time, we didn't mind the long wait under the sun. But the wait could have been shorter if the staff were more attentive. There were already vacant seats but it took another 5 mins before they call the next guest on the list. Not good for the business, definitely not good for waiting customers.\n\nCrab cakes - If i didn't know what they were, I won't be able to guess that they were crab cakes. Just a fishy patty of some sort.\n\nFried calamari/scallop/shirmps - They were cooked just right. Could have been perfect if they were not salty.\n\nRock crab special, served with soup and salad - Soup and salad were served first, expecting they were cooking the crab. After 20 mins, we follow up on the crab and it was brought to our table right away... It was big! At least the top shell.. Underneath the deceiving shell was a crab half of the top shell size. The top shell was even clean, meaning it was empty like as if it has been washed and used several times already. Also, we waited 20 mins for a steamed crab to be served COLD.. Not just room temperature but like it came out of the fridge. Thinking we may have placed the order wrong, we asked the server if it was supposed to be cold. She acted surprised and took the crab back and said she will send it back to be reheated. She came back just few minutes after she sent back the crab, im not surprised that its still not warm. What a waste of money. \n\nSilverwares have heavy water stains, looks very unsanitary. Forks were crooked. We asked for water refill for all 5 glasses and she only filled 2 glasses and attended to needs of the other customers. Good for them, bad for us. We will never come back.",

    "text": "It is hard to believe that I ate at the same place that got all of these rave reviews.  I ordered the chicken tikka, which consisted of some microwaved morsels of chicken and rice, accompanied by a large quantity of yogurt.  The yogurt was cold and partially frozen.  I love frozen yogurt, the type that is supposed to be a substitute for ice cream, but this is not what we were dealing with here.  The dining area was clean but sterile, without decor or other touches that could have made it a comfortable place to hang out.  \n\nBut the big problem was that the food was simply disgusting.  I don't like paying at a dining establishment for chicken that has been reheated in the microwave.  And when you reheat chicken that has already been cut into small pieces, it quickly gets rubbery. Add the icy yogurt, and you get one big EWWWWWWW.  The best part of the meal was that the worker behind the counter gladly provided me with a large tap water on ice, at no charge.  I have noticed a trend, at other low end places, of refusing to provide tap water, charging for it, or giving it in an exceptionally small cup.  But when ice water is the best part of your meal, you know a place has problems.",

And they come, filling it to the brim to devour cheap Tex-Mex and drink cheap beer. Its basic food of choice is the soft taco and its various iterations, filled with chicken, pork or beef, as well as cheese, lettuce and tomatoes,  and bell peppers, for an additional $0.25 each, making a single taco around $1.75-$3.50, or around $5-10 for a decent meal of two tacos and a drink. Many people I know (my roommate) save money by simply purchasing the taco and then loading up on sauces and/or purchasing the limitless chips and salsa or nachos.  Since he survived a full semester on it, I assume it is not a fatal diet. \n\nThe taco isn't bad, its just not particularly special in any way, and if you really get down and calculate, its not that cheap either. The ambiance reminds me of \"nice frat house\", crowds of noisy people, a certain suspicious cleanliness like that of a school cafeteria, and an ordering system consisting of filling out a form and turning it in. \n\nMaybe I need to drink more beer.",

The shrimp appetizer ($6) set the bar low for the evening...four scrawny shrimp were overcooked to the point of being tough and stringy, and coated with a sweet sauce in a vain attempt to dress it up. The futomaki roll was flavorless and the pickled radish was hard. Almost made me glad there were only 5 pieces in that roll! The beef teriyaki bento box ($18) sounded like a good deal, but the food arrived lukewarm to cold and lacked in flavor. \n\nIn addition, the atmosphere inside is really off-putting. The dining space is furnished with shiny black chairs and tables and dimly lit by wall lighting that changes color. There are small tables crowded together on each side of the narrow restaurant space, so our attempts to converse were thwarted by loud customers next to us. \n\nPLEASE go somewhere else in the Rittenhouse area.

    "text": "Oakley's Bistro is the restaurant equivalent to a trophy wife--so beautiful you believe it's worth every penny.  The dining room has a french country feel and the food presentation is beyond artistic--it's stunning.  You really can't help but \"ohhh and ahhh\" over the plates as they come out.  But the over-the-top presentation and menu prices caused me to have very high expectations.  While the food and overall dining experience was good, I left feeling disappointed.\n\nMy meal at Oakley's was rather enjoyable and most of the food was quite good.  In fact, one dish was outstanding.  The suckling pig starter, served with a ricotta crepe and mango puree was heaven.  The meat practically melted in my mouth and the mango flavor was bright and pure.\n\nFrench onion soup is a deceptively simple dish to make and one that is often not executed well at restaurants.  After the pig starter, I had very high expectations.  I was a little surprised by the presentation.  Instead of the traditional crouton and bubbly cheese on top, the broth was \"naked\" and served along-side a small quesedilla-like grilled cheese sandwich.  While I prefer the traditional presentation, I can appreciate that they were doing something different.  Unfortunately, something went horribly wrong with this soup.  My first bite was more fat than broth and left a greasy feeling in my mouth.  Further inspection revealed a large oil slick on top of the soup.  I don't mean a teaspoon or two of truffle oil, I mean a large quantity of oil.  It was so bad that I'm convinced this is not the way the soup is meant to be served, but rather some sort of mistake.\n\nFor the entree, our server recommended the meatloaf.  I've had some really upscale meatloaf dishes recently (such as the Filet Mignon meatloaf at Tavern on South) so I had high hopes.  I was disappointed again.  The flavor of the meat was bland and the chile jam and white cheddar were overpowering.  Even with the accompanying potatoes and vegetables and the artistic presentation, this quite simply was not worthy of the $22 price tag.\n\nThe tilapia with sweet corn risotto was one of the better tilapia dishes I've had.  I really enjoyed the sweetness and texture of the risotto, but it was just a bit undercooked.  And the flavors with the tilapia--sun dried tomato puree, morels and hazelnuts were pure genius.  I could have loved this dish if it weren't for the fact that the tilapia was a bit overcooked.  The whole thing left me feeling like Goldilocks with nothing being \"just right\".\n\nTaking the french onion soup out of the equation, the food at Oakley's is quite good, but not good enough to justify the price.",

    "text": "To the owner, \n\nAs a big fun of Japanese food, I have been a five-year customer to the restaurant (at least once a month, almost every week in its golden days). But after today, I have to say I will not go there any more.\n\nI know it's a Japanese restaurant that ran by a Korean couple (maybe the husband is from Japan), but to be fair enough, the food is quite good, compared to most Japanese restaurants in town. Also loved the green tea candy. So after a few times of price increase, I was still a fan.\n\nHowever, the horrible thing about the restaurant isn't its food, or service. It's the damn waiting time! I had the experience of waiting for over one hour just to get a sushi roll (yes that's the only thing I ordered), and almost 90 mins for a take-out delivery while I was waiting in the restaurant (California combo, again it's just one person portion of food). It's not just two examples. I had those awfully long waiting experience for couple times (all in 2016 tho).\n\nSo I honestly don't know what is happening in the kitchen. I have tried to go there for lunch, dinner, weekdays and weekends. But no exception, I have to wait for a looooooong time. My friends noticed that too. The thing is we all notice it stared in 2016 (or maybe even late 2015). So I am truly wondering what's going on? Even with the most inefficient process, I shouldn't have needed to wait for an hour or longer to get my food! I am not talking about ordering food for a dozen of people, I am talking about ordering food for just one or two persons!\n\nOk anyway, I guess I am just so upset that I had so many times of unpleasant experience with the restaurant and it's not because of me disliking the food. \n\nSo today, I ordered the food again, using ubereat (whatever it's called), hoping it would be different. Again, it made me waited for 70 mins to get my food delivered (one person portion). I know it's not because of the uber delivery as it only took 10 mins to deliver the food to my home (the app tracks each step). Anyway, I finally realize that my time just can't be wasted on this restaurant any more. I decide to stop.\n\nI was a big fan. Such a shame!",

I am a very picky eater and decided to have the soup of the day with a Cesar salad and add chicken. \n\nThe soup was delicious! It was warm, very tasty and perfect size. \n\nAbout 10 minutes before dinner was served the waiter told me that the chef would not add chicken to my salad. Honestly, for the couple hundred that was paid for our total meal, they could have thrown on a darn chicken breast!\n\nMy dad had lamb shank and loved it. \nMy grandmother had mussels but some were served closed.\nMy brother in law had the ribeye but there was a lot of fat on his piece. \n\nThe service was slow slow slow.",

This past time was definitely something to share.\n\nIt took around 15 minutes to get a booth even though there were plenty of free tables...they could have at least sat us and brought us some coffee! After we placed our order the food arrived pretty quickly. There was only one problem though...the waitress brought out a bowl of soup with her thumb stuck half way into it.  That's disgusting! Make that two problems...My breakfast skillet wasn't even close to being hot. It seemed like they just took it out of the fridge and heated it in a microwave for 30 seconds. No bueno. \n\nThe coffee has always been bad, but it was at a new level. It pretty much tasted like hot dirty water--not a pleasant way to wake up in the morning. \n\nAs if this wasn't enough to ruin the experience, we encountered one last problem. When we were ready to leave our check was nowhere to be found. Our waitress had been outside on a smoke break for 10 minutes so we went up front to pay. Nobody in the whole place had our ticket so we had to wait another 10 just to get a new one. \n\nObviously it was a major let down--and I will definitely never go back. It's a shame too because it is a great location and has the potential to be a famous diner. They definitely have their work cut out for them though.",

Unfortunately, when I was there over the weekend for brunch with a party of 8, my experience would probably be my last. We had a very rude server. He was inflexible and arrogant. We  are mostly all vegetarian with one being gluten-free, I purposely selected Blue Sage since I felt their menu and selection really worked for us. \n\nThe person in our party that has severe reactions to dairy requested no hollandaise sauce on her eggs benedict and the response was \"So, you want dry eggs?\" . He would also not allow ketchup with an entree because he felt it would \"not be good\", in his words. He did not actually focus on what we wanted as guests of the restaurant, he seemed more interested in voicing his own opinions. As for the food, it was good, albeit too much, as you HAVE to order and 2 course prix fix meals. It's so much food and most of the first courses could be dessert as they included caramel toppings and loads of sugar.",

The only reason im giving them 2 stars is because their customer service was nice at least, but food wise they completely dissappointed both me and my boyfriend. We both got regular steak burrito meals, and we were both lacking the steak in it, it was mainly beans and sour cream in mine,with a few pieces of steak, burnt steak may i add at that, which normally i coule of been okay with, if there was at least enough in there,  was awfully dissappointing, i usually can barely get through half of my burrito, but i ate the whole thing and still wasnt satisfied. Then we both got the queso for our chips, their queso used to be my favorite thing about this place, it was horrible yesterday, it was completely liquid, like melted butter, wouldnt even stick to the chip and was pointless attempting to eat it. I payed $25 for all this and couldnt of been more upset, dont bother wasting your time or money here any longer, youll only be ripped off, dissappointed and left hungry needing more!",

Super clean bathroom! Soccer on the flat screen. Nice Latin music but not too loud. Relaxing environment.\n\nAnd now for the food. I don't understand the double wrapped taco. There is no point to it. Especially when they don't taste house-made. They taste just like the ones you can by at Wal Mart. I had the chicken mole, beef, and chorizo. I didn't get any mole flavor with the chicken. Maybe it was cooked in? The beef was dry. The chorizo had good flavor but was too salty for my tastes. It was all just too dry and the flavor just was not there. I feel bad writing this review. I wanted to love it. I'll probably go back and try other stuff but the tacos are out.",

    "text": "We, the two of us, went there March 4th for a late lunch.  The place was completely crowded with people waiting outside for a table.  We are vegans and my wife is gluten intolerant.  There was only one item on the menu that we thought we could eat, a vegetarian ramen bowl.  We asked the waiter if we could get gluten free noodles and he said yes so we ordered two of the same for ourselves.  When the bowls arrived a different server said they were not gluten free as the broth was very cloudy.  The person who took our order neglected to tell us the broth was made with wheat and there was nothing else on the menu she could eat, everything had meat or wheat in it.  My wife rejected the order and I ate mine.  Wife had nothing to eat and had to sit there watching me eat mine. \n \nI find it amazing that in a restaurant that advertises itself as selling Japanese food doesn't have any Japanese dishes without meat or wheat.  Japan is or was a rice based food culture with many dishes without meat or fish.  All I can figure is Raijin thinks all Americans want meat and wheat so they design their menu accordingly.\n\nYoshimatsu restaurant on Campbell Ave. sells many meat and wheat free dishes.  \n\nRaijin is also overpriced for what you get.  Yoshimatsu is cheaper with a lot more variety in the dishes especially ramen dishes.\n\nWe ate a a ramen restaurant in downtown San Diego recently that served vegan and gluten free ramen bowls.\n\nI hope Raijin reads this and changes their menu because my ramen bowl was very good with the added garlic hot mixture I ordered as a side and put into my bowl. I would like to return there and give it another try with my wife.\n\nThere are many, many people out there that don't eat meat and or wheat after all.",

Party of 4 ordered pancakes, eggs and frittata all which were good, problem was the service. Two in our party received their food the other two did not. Nothing worse than half the table getting their food while the others have to wait!!!  Folks w/o food say \" go ahead, don't wait\". In my opinion this is just about the worst thing a restaurant could do to a guest.  Despite the food being good the type of service we received during our visit caused us to have a poor dining experience.  Unfortunately we left the location vowing never to return.  Please 1682 work on this issue, it's important and has a huge impact on the customer experience. Food get 4 stars, service gets 1.",

We tried several things on two different visits and nothing was very good. \n\nI tried scrapple for the first time (he thought it would be funny) and OMG that was probably the single worst bite of food that I have ever put in my mouth. It was like someone ate breakfast sausage, threw it up and they grilled it on the flat top and served it to me. This does not affect my review because I don't blame this place for that horror, I blame the entire state of Pennsylvania. \n\nThe seafood omelet looked interesting and the crab was spelled with a C and not a K so we asked the server if it was real crab or imitation krab and his response was \"I think so, the owner is really into fishing\" um jiggawha? He couldn't be bothered to find our for sure so we took a risk and ordered it. Mistake. Not because of fake krab or anything because there was NO crab or seafood of any kind that we could find. Yet it managed to smell fishy and taste like a whole lot of funk. \n\nBreakfast pie was ok but I make this dish better at home and it was just screaming for cheese, as was I. I did like the hollandaise though. I will say that this dish was served with sliced tomatoes that were very fresh and tasty. One of the best things we had. The corn muffin was good as well. The potatoes were seasoned but were cold. \n\nCorned beef hash was straight out of the can. Iced tea with lemon comes without lemon, etc. When sliced tomatoes and a corn muffin are the stand outs.....\n\nI'll pass on future visits.",

The waitress was alright - not amazing, but not horrible - she had a bad habit of just leaving us for 20 minutes at a time randomly. \nThe food is why I'm giving this place two stars. My boyfriend ordered pasta, and I ordered a chicken sandwich. They give massive portions, which I like, however it seems like they're dead set on drowning every dish they serve. Because my side (Caesar salad) had just /too much/ dressing. My boyfriend's \"pasta\" was more like a stew or a thick soup, there was so much sauce. He was really upset about it, and he's not even the type of person to be picky about food. I offered to bring it up for him to our waitress but he insisted that I just leave it alone. We paid our bill and tipped, then left a little disappointed. Don't think we will be returning to this BPs location again.

    "text": "I have eaten here multiple times and really enjoyed it but my last visit was my worst experience. We got seated at around 11 when it wasn't super busy and after our waitress took our order it took 50 min to get our food. We actually hadn't seen our waitress at all and had to ask a different waitress where our food was. People that were seated after us got their food before us. When my pancakes arrived they were extremely cold and when I told the waitress she took them to the kitchen then came back to say : \"what do you want us to do with them like microwave them or remake them im not sure what they can do\" I was honestly so confused because if you as an employee don't know what the kitchen can do then why and how are you working here?? Once my eggs Benedict came they were alright, the bread was extremely hard and it took me awhile to cut through it. My boyfriend had the chicken and waffles which were good. At the end when we asked for our check we waited another 20 minutes for her to come tell us to stand in line and tell her what table we are in order to get the check. Truly an awful experience. I honestly think it was all because of our awful waitress who if I ever come back I will request to not have her.",

    "text": "Had dinner here on a recent Friday evening.  Glad we had reservations (for 5) as they were packed tight, have learned this is to be expected in a new Tampa restaurant. Excellent and very attentive service could not make up for the so-so food.  \n\nWe ordered several appetizers to share - queso fundito and flautas de pollo.  Queso was tasty but nearly impossible to tackle and remove to a chip once the skillet dish cooled off.  2 flautas for $8 served on a large plate, fancy dressed but not impressive for taste.  I had carne asada iron skillet tacos, served with mini corn tortillas which were so soft they fell apart when I tried to load them.  Finally went to the beef (??) with a knife and fork as it was quite tough and lacked any real flavor.  The accompanying sauces were quite good.  For me, the best by far was the delightful passion fruit tea - served in a tequila bottle.\n\nBesito is high on atmosphere, gimmick and price.  Maybe Tampa will support this location past the new-restaurant-frenzy phase.  For the price, there are too many other local options for me to hurry back here.",

Line was pretty short, and moved along pretty fast with plenty of open tables.   \n\nThey have an abundance of meats and sides and I ordered the brisket with an add-on of sausage and for sides collards, smoked jalapenos and fried pickles and it came with a biscuit.  All of it looked good but in the end it was meh since my entire entree was basically luke warm almost cold, which was surprising since I watched them take out a fresh brisket and I got the first slices but surprisingly it was not hot (not even warm).  The brisket, albeit room temp, was good.  The sausage wasn't anything special, but still good.  As for the sides: collards, good but nothing to get excited over.  They do use ham hock but it's missing some more salt and some of the vinegar tang to it.  The smoked jalapenos are stuffed with cheese and wrapped in bacon, which sounds amazing, but this is the type of side that needs to be fresh.  It def had a great taste and probably would be amazing if it had just come out of the oven.  The fried pickles had the potential to be amazing, they use thick cut round garlic pickles (my fav) but then they just put way too much breading on them that if you ate them with the breading you lost the taste of the pickle.  Finally, the biscuit.  It look good, it's a heavy dense kind (not light and flaky at all) and I commented on if it was hot that butter and honey would be amazing on it (but alas it was not hot and there was no butter to be found, though didn't see honey).  \n\nSo all in all, it was just okay.  It has the potential to be great, but with everything being luke warm and mostly bland it just turned me off.  There are other BBQ places around that are just as good so I'm not sure I'll be back.",

I asked for a simple iced coffee with a splash of caramel , but the rude server said \"we don't have any of that , I'll just have to give you regular coffee with a side of ice \". So in other words...they don't care about making their customers happy. I don't see what's so hard about making an iced coffee. This place thrives only from the good food...but service had gone to crap. Never shall I dine here again. May skyway cafe hit the skyway and into the ocean.",

    "text": "This was our first time trying Cal Taco, as we just moved to town and it's a 3 minute walk from our apartment. You probably wouldn't notice the place unless you were looking for it, but it's less of a dive inside than you would think, i.e. chain-fast-food-restaurant-style chairs and tables that are anchored to the ground and commercial signs designating the soda and salsa bars.\n\nWe ordered two tacos each, with the beans/rice/drink combo as well. We probably should have split one of the combo plates as the walk home was a bit more of a waddle. The fish tacos were decent, but I've had better. \nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/VeFfrEZ4iWaecrQg6Eq4cg?select=-cSzA1ONPpzJcj_GkQ2Eow\n\nThe fish itself didn't have much flavor so most of the taco's taste came from the toppings. I'd try a burrito next time. The beans and rice were fine, but the cheese shreddings on top seemed unmeltable! Throughout the whole meal they maintained their waxy shredded-cheese shape. Ah well!\n\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/VeFfrEZ4iWaecrQg6Eq4cg?select=eLr4PuYuaIF1PUTVGQ8D1A\n\nOverall I thought it was fine, but a littleeee too pricey for the quality.",

There was a dry small wedge of cracker to go with it. That's all. To me, this restaurant is a very Americanized version of \"Greek\" food, with chicken topping just about everything. There's no tabbouleh, only one option for hummus (as a side) no felafel, the spanikopita comes with chicken too -- odd. Kalamatas is so much better and I hope this bland Americanized alternative either improves considerably or won't prove much competition in Green Hills.",

There is a bar/dining area,off to the left is a kitchen, in front of that is a enclosed area with a separate entrance for take out and around back is the beer garden.I sat at the bar and had a few beers and ordered a mini pizza and a small antipasto to go.I have to say I have never seen so many employees in a place of this size. As I sat at the bar I saw dozens of pizzas going right by me on their way to the dining area. They looked awesome, crust perfectly browned, some I could see the cheese bubbling.So when I got my order back to the hotel room I was shocked, the pizza was not cooked, the crust had no color and the cheese was barely melted,on top of each slice was one scared little piece of pepperoni  .I was very hungry and ate two slices and it was so bad I threw the other two away.The salad was good so at least I was full.\nI dont know what to say,everyone was ordering large pies,I might have been the only mini of the night so the kitchen said lets really screw this one up.\nWords to the wise, if you have a take out order check every part of it carefully before you leave  , my mistake.",

It was my go-to special/fancy dinner place because the food and service was always top notch. No more, it seems. My date and I made a reservation, but when we arrived they had lost our reservation. Our waiter was inattentive and visibly irritated that I didn't order alcohol and neither my date or I ordered an appetizer; perhaps as a result of this, he was inattentive the entire night, rarely ever checking on us. I ordered the fettucine alfredo which was very disappointing and almost flavorless despite being $19. After the waiter neglected to show me the bottom shelf of the dessert cart and I had to ask about it, I ordered the peanut butter cake which was underwhelming, at best. And to top it off, the restaurant was loud all night. All this plus the mandatory valet parking...I don't know what changed, but La Collina is no longer the great spot it used to be.",

I've had such bad service the past few times, but the last time was the worst. I had a waiter who I had previously had and didn't particularly enjoy. I asked for sour cream when I ordered, again when he dropped the food off, and then again ten minutes later when he didn't bring it yet. I also had an entire cheeseburger, ketchup and fries dumped down my back by another waitress. I've had her before and she's actually the only waitress there that I have decent service from. She paid for my $5 happy hour food, but my pants were pretty much ruined.

I was hoping the tzatziki sauce would pull it all together, nope! It had no flavor either. It wasn't like the sauce you'd imagine, but more like a thin tasteless glue. Only good part about the wrap were the fresh diced cucumber & tomato, too bad that was underneath the icky white sauce that doesn't even deserve to be called tzatziki : (",

It's just too over the top in terms of breakfast offerings (they don't honor any food exceptions and they don't even offer a standard eggs and bacon option).  Everything is overly complicated, and takes about 3 looks to actually understand the menu.  I ordered the tofu salad, which was just blah.  My friend ordered the chocolate waffle - he said it was very chocolatey, but didn't have much else to say.  The service was slow and inattentive, even though the place was only a quarter full.

It was not as good as my dinner was previously.\n\nThe huevos rancheros was served in a cast iron skillet, which is cool, but it really wasn't doing it for me. It kind of tasted bland and the refried beans were more like a soup than they were like a refried bean. Also, the breakfast burrito doesn't come with any type of sauce like guac or sour cream, and I think that's just weird.\n\nOur waitress, while very pretty (Megan Fox look-alike), was pretty checked out. She didn't come over to check on us and only refilled our water glasses after my friend had to start drinking out of my glass. She also didn't ask if I wanted a refill of my coffee. When my friend asked for ketchup she brought the bottle to our table and slid it across the table. I don't know if it was intentional or not, but it was pretty rude.\n\nI'll stick with Green Eggs or Cantina Dos Segundos for breakfast now on.",

We decided to have desserts here, and we ordered different cakes. I ordered the red velvet cake which tasted normal, but the chocolate cakes were horrific!  My friend Brett ordered the Chocolate coconut cake, and my friend Frank got the Chocolate Mousse cake. The frosting tasted like nail polish! Yes! Nail polish!  When we told our waitress, she told her manager about it, but he didn't try to fix the problem. We told the waitress to taste the frosting, and she even agreed that both cakes tasted like nail polish. I'm guessing that whoever baked the cake probably just had their nails done, and got some of the nail solution in the frosting. Pretty gross.",

    "text": "I have eaten here in the past and had no issues, and there food was good. But i never made review and after this last experience i knew i had to update my opinion for this place. My wife and i wanted to celebrate our 5 year anniversary, but since she got laid off a couple weeks prior funds were tight. I was able to save enough money to the side for us to enjoy some seafood dinner date at home.  We got 5 lbs of Crawfish, 2 lbs of Shrimp, a stuff artichoke and some potatoes, corn and mushrooms, that added up to $55. So already i thought it was over priced for the bags we were given to take home. When we opened the bag everything was mixed together, so we dumped in a large bowl to share. My wife wanted Crawfish and i wanted Shrimp, the shrimp were very good, tasted great easy to peel, no complaints. We couldn't find any mushrooms, and the amount of potatoes & Corn was on the light side. The stuff artichoke was very good, easy to pick apart without everything falling off the leaves. What made my review so low was the entire time we were eating i could hear my wife bitching and for once it wasn't about me so i was curious as to what it was about. She showed me the Crawfish, they were all small, many looked crushed, many had straight tails ( Dead before cooking ) but what was the most annoying thing was the ton of claws at the bottom of the bowl. It looked like we got the end of the barrel and since we had take out we go the shitty leftovers and the sit down people got the nice pretty, large Crawfish. So we took a couple pictures and both agreed the entire meal was not worth $55, My wife called the manager and told him what happened, he didn't believe her saying they boil over 3,000 lbs of Crawfish a day and had no complaints ( maybe ours was the end of that 3,000 lbs since we had a but load of claws ) so i guess to shut my wife up he said to pass by and get some Crawfish and mushrooms. Now don't get me wrong there food was good, i guess i was annoyed about the service and the amount paid for the little we got. Whenever i get my crawfish i will update on how they handled it.",

When you bring a plate to someone and there is no cutlery recognizing first is a plus but even being attentive enough to bring it when it is asked for is acceptable as well. \n\nThere were two cooks for a room holding about 30 people. It shouldn't take that long to make a cold seafood dish. We did make reservations and although the service was very poor it was poor with a smile on their face, so I honestly feel bad and think they can't do any better\n\nSomeone might enjoy this place better if it was emptier-the cooking and service would be expected to be better. My suggestion would be to go for the wine and some snack size appies that range from 14-24 dollars, and then walk down to the blue plate diner for a meal that is half the price, excellent service and has that cozy feeling-just in a larger area.",

The waitress was very nice when I mentioned it, and she took the dish back promptly to correct the mistake.

Wrong. If there was a lot of grease on the top perimeter of the dish, there was waaaay more soaking into the hash brown base. I had to stop there.

When asked, \"Are you selling that too\" they quickly swept it up and said. \"Uhhh, ...no\". So I think they are selling more then pizza. I hope not. \n\nI waited more then an hour for pizza. By be time I got it I was so hungry. And I think it was worth it. This review is a combination of two visits here. \n\nThe bar was packed with happy people but I didn't go in.

Now, the fries are fresh cut but I suspect they were fried in oil that was too cold because they were very greasy, they got me sick to my stomach eating them. The burger was okay, comparable to Burger King and good for fast food but not up to what you would get at a good restaurant or diner (which after all the hype was what I was expecting). It wasn't really bad, but disappointing when I expected good and got adequate.",

I found out that this store does not participate in the redeem points for gas program for use at Giant gas stations.   I can do same shop at Giants in Trooper or  or Limerick on my way home and redeem some points.  Also yesterday I stupidly did not pick up the $20 at the self check out that I had requested.  A few seconds after I realized I had not, I ran back.  The person who checked out immediately after me took it.   I know it's my fault but when I reported it to management, they said nothing they could do.  So I gave them my contact information in the event that the person who took it might turn it in, all they could say was 'good luck with that one'.      Since the person behind me had also requested cash back I thought maybe they didn't realize they took an extra 20 and might return it.  I think based on their credit card information the management would be able to identify and contact them and ask but they would not.   Since over the years I have spent 1000s of $ there and since they basically blew me off, plus no redeem points program I am done with them.",

Our waiter Mike was just unprofessional, a tad snooty, and slow.  He has a hard time understanding what customer service is, and he tries to push unwanted items from the menu on you.  Maybe he should pay more attention to his customers instead of relaying heavily on the bussers.  They were great.  They brought the bread, the served the food, they kept the glasses filled, and they picked up the plates.  All Mike did was take our order, disappear during the entire meal, and then make us wait a good 10 minutes to bring the check.   \n\nAs for the food, it was just okay.  It was hot and fresh, but on the bland side.  Neither myself or my friend finished our meals.  \n\nThis place is more show than substance.  There are plenty of other Italian places in this city.

That's the most disappointing part. \nMy boyfriend and I love Mexican food. So we went here on valentines day. How can a restaurant claim to be Mexican food when there is no fried ice cream on the menu?! This should have been my first clue. Next clue should have been that the names of the food were in English with some having a Spanish translation underneath. \nThe food was terrible. Nothing tasted good. \nThis was just a restaurant trying to hard to be something it's not.

    "text": "Stopped by here since it was across the street from where we were staying. The only reason this place is still in business is because of the location. We were greeted upon arrival and sat quickly...nothing afterwards was quick. It took at least 15 minutes before for someone came to the table to greet us and ask what we wanted to drink. We ordered at that time as well since we had plenty of time to look at menus. I'm a mahi mahi fan so I ordered it as a sandwich and fried with cole slaw. I'll put it this way, I was so disappointed in it I left an entire piece (came with 2 decent sized cuts of mahi) but the breading was the worst I've ever had, the slaw was mayo based not vinegar based as the waitress stated, and it was possibly the most bland food I've ever had in my 38 years of existence. My friend had clam basket that was mostly fries and equally unimpressive. Son had spaghetti that he said tasted like nothing. Daughter had burger that she said tasted fine and she ate all of it. The waitress didn't seem to know much about anything she served and consistently gave two craps about who ordered what. She would bring out something we asked for and would hand it to someone else at the table. She seemed confused as hell. Long story short this place could have been in our building and I wouldn't eat here again. If you see this place full or a good review I guarantee it's from local clientele. I've been all over the world, this isn't even good for local food. If lack of effort had a taste, this is it.",

Great location, patio, places for kids to play, great vibe. Decent selection of tap beer. Too bad they had to serve food here. (at least what we had)\n\nWe both had Baja Fish Tacos. Non descript sauce,  fish smelled like they did not clean out the fryer, cabbage was flat, no other quality ingredients or flavors that came through. The salsa was watery no flavor, no onion or cilantro or pepper flavor, really really poor quality. After eating these fish tacos you really appreciate Spencer Mackenzie's in Ventura. \n\nWe also had Cole slaw and it tasted like a pile of poor quality cabbage. No sauce or other flavors. I actually took it back and asked if they forgot to mix in anything with the slaw. Even after they \"fixed it\" it was horrible. \n\nI understand they have the Hook hamburgers here so will give it another shot one of these days.",

It took our server about 5 minutes to arrive at our table. He took our drink and food order. I lied, I have another good thing to say. Our food came out insanely fast. I ordered the Strawberry Crepes and a side of bacon. The bacon was delicious, cooked well and nice and thick. The crepes on the other hand were a huge let down. I'm sorry to say that Ihop's are better. My crepes were bland and lacked any filling. The powdered sugar and strawberry topping were non existent. Our server NEVER came back to the table until we were completely done and that was just to drop off the check. Never asked how everything was or even offer a refill. Breakfast is my favorite meal of the day and honestly, I've had better and could have saved money by going somewhere else. $4.50 for a side of bacon is a bit extreme, and $8 for the main meal with no additional side items is pretty steep. I can't recall a breakfast joint where I spent $32 for so little food (pancakes, crepes, 2 sides of bacon, & 2 drinks).

The plates are like ones you would pick up at a dollar store to serve birthday cake when you didn't have time to go to a real store. The napkins are cheaper than you can imagine. Tissues would almost be better. You are eating a wet sloppy sandwich and these things matter. I used no less than 8 of these tear away napkins when eating the sandwich. If the napkins were just as good as the ones at McDonalds I would have only needed two. This can't be saving them money. I'm not asking for fine china and linen.

    "text": "I WANT to like this place. I really, really do, but I have been disappointed every time I go in. I live very close by and it's really nice to have a place to go to when you're in a pinch in the middle of a recipe and realize you forgot something. However, many items are very overpriced. Also, they don't carry things I thought for SURE they would have. I wanted to get some whole wheat buns. They have to have that, right?? I mean, they sell veggie burger patties, wouldn't they have buns to go with it? No, they only have loaves of bread. Perhaps I was missing something, but no one there is particularly interested in helping customers. Every time I go, I say \"I'm never going back there!\" But of course, I find myself going back and giving them another chance and another chance. The strength of this place is that it is the only grocery store in the immediate area. For that reason, I'm very happy to have this in the neighborhood. I would never do an actual shopping trip here. I would end up spending 2 to 3 times as much there as I would elsewhere. I was behind a man in line who paid $100 for a couple boxes of veggie patties and some produce. I couldn't believe it when they told him his total! Overall, I don't think this is a terrible place, I just wish the prices were a little reasonable and they carried more things. I've often stopped in here to find something and then had to walk to whole foods when they didn't have it. So I often wonder, what's the point?",

    "text": "I gave Zaxby's a try.  It's located in front of the Super Target.  The building itself is new and nice.  Now...the food.  I got a Zax Snack Pack (three chicken tenders, crinkle cut fries, piece of Texas toast, one Zax's sauce, and a drink).  I went through the drive through around a prime lunch time.  \n\nBelow are some pros and cons.  Overall disappointing service and mediocre, bland food.  I won't be back, but will instead visit Chick-Fil-A or PDQ.\n\nPros:  \n1.  I like the bag had handles, it made it easy to grab.\n2.  Served with a mint and hand towel.\n3.  Drink is in styrofoam cup.\n4.  Texas Toast was good, probably my favorite of the three food items.\n5.  Easy to arrive/leave from parking lot.\n\nCons:  \n1.  Chicken lacked flavor (prefer Chick-Fil-A or PDQ), some tenders were very small, and  each tender had some \"skin\" on it.  See picture.  This was not the savory chicken skin like a rotisserie chicken, but fat or grizzle I couldn't bite into.\n2.  Fries lacked flavor (again prefer Chick-Fil-A or PDQ).  A very small amount of fries had what appeared to be a reddish season salt on them and they were better, but still lacking flavor.\n3.  Drink served overflowing with soda run off and a wet straw.  This is so annoying to me!\n4.  Service is as poor as other reviews cite.  Woman yelled to another employee \"Jesus (explicative) Christ, this isn't rocket science.  I need...\" and proceeded to rattle off drive through tickets waiting.  \n5.  You are charged for extra sauces",

We ordered KFC, poke, some sushi, ramen, and one Korean beef dish.\n\nKFC - just ok;\nPoke - fresh but very small portion, like, very small;\nSushi - standard; \nRamen - not the real ramen. The broth is just soy sauce( like the ones you can make at home for less than $1) not the authentic broth that takes a long time to make;\nKorean beef dish - ok, you can taste a lot of sugar.\n\nOver all the fool is just ok. Restaurants want to focus on too many things may not always be a good thing. The worst part is, everything is very over priced. I think they should only charge 60% of it will be more reasonable. Maybe because the rent is high or something but the food was definitely not worth the price. Service was ok, but I can already see if they are busy they probably can't  handle it just like most of the Asian restaurants around. \n\nNot going back.",

There was a half hour wait for a table, and there were no seats at the bar, but a party of five didn't show up, so we were seated within a couple of minutes.  We each ordered a Village Burger medium rare with cheddar, and the boyfriend piled on bacon as well, with a side of duck fat fries and a chocolate shake.  \n\nHungry as we were, the entire meal (except the pickle) was an utter let-down.  The burgers were more watery than juicy and overly seasoned and the fries were also incredibly salty as well as burnt.  The boyfriend's chocolate shake was served in a cocktail glass and tasted like cocoa, that is to say, not right, and utterly disappointing.  Between us we couldn't finish a drink served in a mojito-sized tumbler.  Although our server passed by frequently to refill our water glasses, we were never asked if everything was all right, not even when presented with the check.\n\nMaybe we just came on an off night, but I really can't picture myself coming back here.

    "text": "While heading to get some Mardi Gras supplies nearby I finally stopped for lunch at Unagi. Overall it was a mixed bag.\n\nI like that I was given a small bowl of a noodle salad (just like Mikimoto, but not as good) when I was seated. I ordered the lunch roll combination and a squid salad. First out was a bowl of miso soup. Miso is very hard to do wrong and still hard to do really well. Most places have just middle of the road miso soup and I often use it as the first measure of the quality of a sushi restaurant. Unagi produced a barely mediocre miso soup. I didn't bother with the house salad that came with my combination but I did enjoy the squid salad. Then again, it's pre-packaged so all they had to do was put it in a bowl.\n\nThe lunch roll combination is simple: pick two from a list of rolls for about $7. That's a pretty good deal since just the rolls are usually more than that and you also get the soup and salad.  This is where things start to fall apart. While I do appreciate getting 8 pieces rather than 6 for each roll (I was expecting skimpy rolls for a lunch special and was pleasantly surprised) the rice itself was mushy. If I was making the sushi I would never have served that rice. One of the rolls I ordered was the Philadelphia roll, a personal favorite. Usually that means smoked salmon and Philadelphia cream cheese as if it were a bagel. Instead of salmon they used tuna. A weird choice and ok tasting, but I was expecting salmon like every other Philly roll I've ever had uses.\n\nOverall it's cheap sushi but you don't get nearly the quality you do at other places. I've even seen buffets that are better.",

But altogether we waited about 40 minutes from the time that we checked in to the time that we got our food so that in a bit so was daunting. The atmosphere was okay although it took a long time for us to get a refill for our coffees which wasn't by our waiter. In actuality our waiter Daniel was the saving grace from this restaurant visit. Their food is subpar something normal you can make in your own kitchen and a little bit pricey at about eight dollars average per plate. Their portions are great I had the waffle plate and my sister had the biscuits and gravy she and she did not like the gravy and she said it was canned. Unfortunately I do not like to leave poor reviews but as a avid yelper I feel it's important to leave honest reviews. We did however really enjoy the customer service aspect waiter Daniel was awesome and make sure that he knew it.

I usually read reviews complaining about service with a huge grain of salt and tend to ignore them as coming from whiners who find fault everywhere.  But when I took my family to Jack Dempsey's this weekend, it was the worst service I have had in years.  Inattention, getting the order wrong, very long delays while the waitress was clowning around with old friends at another table (which was not even her table).  I won't be going back, which is a shame because I liked the place and the fried seafood was well above average.",

The hostess was also the busser and the manager so she would disappear for 10-15 mins at a time. This is something that might work on a slower weekday morning, but not on a busy Saturday morning. Once we got a seat, it took over 10 mins to get the 2 chocolate milks that I ordered for my 2 toddlers. They also brought out my kids food about 15 minutes before they brought me and my husband's orders out. My kids were done with their pancakes before we even received our breakfast. \n\nAs for the food, it was okay. My omelet was nothing special. My daughter's blueberry pancake was still a little doughy in the middle, but we didn't dare ask for a new one because it took so long to get it to begin with. \n\nThe best part of the experience was the cute two block area in which this place was situated. If we are back in St. Louis anytime soon, we would probably pick another spot to stop.",

My issue is with the food itself.  I have to say \"Tasty BUT....\".   I had ordered the High Tea for One.  I was expecting the traditional look of high tea with 3 tiers.  What I got was a plate with 5 little finger sandwiches, a scone with lemon curd and clotted cream and a slice of cake cut in 2.  Sandwiches were kind of tasty but the fillings were extremely stingy.  Scone was lovely as well as the lemon curd and clotted cream.  The soup was a tomato basil and was very tasty but entirely too chunky for the portion.  It was more of a marinara in consistency.  I was disturbed to see into the kitchen and see them preparing their vegetable cheese soup and the cheese soup was actually a sauce by Ragu.  The desserts were a gyp.  It was billed to be 2 cakes and chocolates.  No chocolates and it was one slice of store bought loaf cake cut into 2 pieces.    The meal was tasty; don't get me wrong, it was just disappointing.\n\nFinal note...If you have allergies to certain foods in the finger sandwiches, they have a strict NO SUBSTITUTIONS policy.",

Only person by a register was our server. Certainly hope she wasn't manager. Left  .79 and she never returned with any change to see if maybe we wanted to add to it. Guess what guys, You're in.

    "text": "After a few email exchanges with Pizza Hut national customer service and a $10 credit for the dozens of forgotten dips, things got a little better for a while. Sure, I've had to devote the special instructions field on every order to an all caps reminder for their drivers to \"PLEASE DON'T FORGET THE DIPS!\", and there were still several incidents where an apologetic driver had to run back to the store to get forgotten items, but it was getting a little better. \n\nNow, however, even the extra reminder isn't helping,  and it's not just dips, but 2 liter sodas that get left behind when the drivers leave the store with a delivery. Tonight, I paid for 2 ranch dips to go with 16 boneless wings, and there was only one in the box. I guess it's time for another round of customer service complaints. \n\nI wish they'd just automatically include 1 free dip for every 8 wings like their competitors do. Then perhaps their driver training would stick. At the very least, they should not trust that the cooks are filling their delivery bags correctly without checking the order against the receipt,  but I guess that additional step would only extend their already 1.5-hour delivery time (on a good night!).",

The waitress gave me some baloney excuse about how they don't want the beer to sit out that long. If your beer goes bad that fast, you've got a problem. They also have a card that tells you that you should only order a pint of beer if you're really serious about drinking, and they suggest you use caution if you order a pint of beer with an abv of over 7%. Woah, a whole pint!?!\n\nFood: mediocre at best. Everything we had could have been better in some way. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't good either. Ceviche was just a scoop of fish sitting in vinegar, street corn was overcooked, crab tacos were dry, burger was decent but small, donut was burnt on the outside. The burger came with a pint of beer (look out).  The waitress asked me what kind of beer I wanted. How am I supposed to answer that question when you won't bring me multiple small pours?  I'd have to sit there for two hours before I could make a decision. \n\nService: below average. Hostess didn't say a word, I don't know my server's name, and it took too long to get our check. She would not budge on the multiple beers thing. I'm sure that's policy, but I've never been to a restaurant, especially a mediocre one, and been told no for any reason whatsoever. I'm a grown up. I think I can handle two four-ounce beers at once.\n\nOverall, this is a pretty pretentious, disappointing restaurant with really good beer. If you've got a bunch of tattoos, a sick new haircut, and like being told how much you can drink at a bar, then this is the place for you. Otherwise, get a growler to go and order a pizza or something.",

    "text": "Generally speaking, I am a big fan of Whole Foods, but this visit left a sour taste in my mouth.\n\nSo I wasn't too thrilled with my initial visit to Clay Terrace, but I figured if there would be any saving grace to that place, it would be the Whole Foods, right?  Wrong.  The set up of this store is pretty similar to any other Whole Foods.  The selection, prices, etc... all of that was the same.  Here are the things that bothered me:\n\n1. Free samples- who doesn't love free samples?  It would have been nice if they had toothpicks/utensils to eat them.  And some of that stuff looked like it had been sitting there for hours.\n\n2. Cashiers- generally speaking, I think this is where Whole Foods (and Trader Joes) really differentiates themselves from other grocery stores.  As we approached the cash registers, 3 of them were open, but didn't have anyone working them.  Evidently all of them were having a rousing conversation at the third person's station.  \n\nWhen we finally managed to get the attention of one of them, we got down to business.  After my wife had paid, the cashier handed her the receipt, but began takling to the bagger (who showed up after the fact) about an order she needed processed.  My wife stood there, not sure if she needed to sign, or if she was all good.  The bagger actually had to ask the cashier if we were good to go, to which she replied a hasty \"oh, yeah.\"  \n\nOVERALL- Whole Foods- you really let me down on this one.  I didn't knock you too hard, but I don't think I'll be coming to this location anytime soon.\n\nCelebrity Rating- Sheryl Crow",

There are far too many other options in the area!  LOL\n\nS---    Honey's was so-so!!!\n\nThis pretty much sums it up.  I had pumpkin pancakes. They had far too much cinnamon. Also had eggs and potatos. The potatos were good, I suppose.  My boyfriend had a Poorboy, and thought it was mediocre at best too.  Not bad, Not good, just average.  Add the over-crowded atmosphere... and the place is just not worth standing in the rain for 20 minutes, (which some people did) or sitting in a tightly packed waiting area with somebody's BUTT in your face for 20 minutes. (which I did!  LOL)  In their favor, I will say Honey's was cozy... it was a cold and rainy day, and I appreciated that Honey's had their heat on, unlike some other hipster spots that insist on having the a/c cranked up all year long!\n\nThe best part of my meal was my english breakfast tea... which I could have bought at any Target store and made myself at home. In short, Honey's is ok, but not worthy of more than 2 stars. I may revisit later and see if it wasn't just what I ordered that wasn't so hot.",

Perhaps it was old and rehashed, as that's how it tasted, but I shouldn't have been served that in the first place. Fried apples are weirdly tasteless, grits and gravy most likely cooked out of a box as they don't taste anything remotely fresh. Over Easy eggs were OK but it's very hard to screw that up. Oats with apple and seeds was OK. We just came here as there no options around, I'd skip this place if possible. On the other hand, old country decoration is nice, service is as expected.",

A very kind employee held the door open for us as we entered, but we were left standing at the host's desk for a bit before someone showed us to a table outside. I noticed immediately that there were crumbs on my plate and napkin. Odd. We were told Sarah would be our waitress, and we did speak to her once before our waiter suddenly changed without warning. I didn't catch his name.\n\nWhile waiting for our orders, my bf noticed how high the armrests on the chairs were, which made them a little more uncomfortable. I marveled at the price of a milkshake ($7!) and all the other items on the menu.\n\nThe bf & I ordered the \"blazing\" wings, which were not at all blazing and actually quite bland. However, they were hot when brought out to us and had just the right level of crispiness. I thought they were on the greasy side though. These would have been really good wings if they had had any flavor.\n\nWe also got the East Loop thin crust pizza, which had a lot of pesto, chicken, mushroom, and red onions. It looked like it had a lot going on, so I was excited... and then put off by the strange texture and aftertaste of the pesto. I really wasn't expecting that. I ate the two smallest slices and was not at all tempted to eat more.\n\nSo I probably won't be back. Maybe I would have liked a different pizza or a salad instead of the wings, but eating here again would feel like a gamble. I'd rather stick to Papa John's or Domino's for pizza & wings.\n\n\nThey did play some good music though.",

But the place looked like this place I used to go back in my town which offered a salad bar too, so I was all ready for it. \n\nFirst off, the salad bar ain't free. But you can't even ADD it onto your pizza; it's a whole different order. It's $6 for a \"large\" which is pretty much your average bowl size. The small was half that. WHAT A RIP OFF. They did have a special though which was two slices of pizza and a small salad bar bowl for $7 total, but it was only for lunch and we were there for dinner. But what's even worse is that you can only make ONE TRIP to the salad bar! I mean if you're going to make us pay an obscene amount for it and have small bowls, you might as well let us get as much as we want, but noooooo.\n\nBut the salad was alright. Nothing worth $6 though FOR SURE. We ordered a half pepperoni and half hawaiian on thin crust, which I admit was good. Again, nothing spectacular. Probably not going to be coming here again unless I'm desperate and it's lunch time.",

I consistently get carryout pasta at several other places for about $13.00 WITH SALAD and get 2-4 meals from each meal. Even Maggiano's gives you a \"pasta to go\" for an average price of $16.00.

Althogh it does taste better because it is made to order, French press is the frickin easiest way to make your own coffee at home.",

It was not even half full and the service was horrible.  it took forever for any request.  so lets break this out:\nDesign: 5, love the wood work, feels slightly elegant\n\nAtmosphere: 3, would have liked to hear Italian music not 80-90s music over satelite\n\nService: 2, our waitress was hard to understand and obviously did not know enough about Italian food as some of our food requests they didn't list was basic, like pasta with garlic and oil.\nNumber one rule as a server, NEVER LET A DRINK GO DRY !!!!!. The server.....she made several major mistakes with drinks and general service.  Ladies should always be served first, wine should be first poured by the server and not plopped on the table with glasses. bringing condiments for your meal 10 minutes after we start eating is useless (pepper and cheese).   i watched a male server working away and he had his \"A\" game on. i watched a table come in well after us and leave before we got our meal.  The female we had was sleeping or was following snails to our table...WAKE UP !!!!\n\nFood:  2, poorly timed dishes,  two plates came out so they sat as we waited for the other two. 4:30 minutes go by....wow finally the other two come...if the food inspector ever came by they would certainly fail the food temperature test, several dishes were luke warm at best.  the flavor of the dishes were blah, except the pasta with garlic.  one dish had veal and it was tough meat.  The other two dishes had chicken and they were dry and tough.\n\nPrice:3, the prices are way to high for what you get, i had a dish that was $25.95 that was worth maybe $19.95 at best, my friend had meatballs, that was priced at $14.95, that's reasonable and the portion was good sized. \n\nAs a server you are the first and last person to represent the brand and a restaurant, if you fail as a server in your duties you are failing the business and the doors will close fast.\n\nI hope the owners read this",

I ordered a fried chicken dinner that came with mash potatoes, salad and peas.  I ordered garlic toast and not charged.  Meal was $9.00 and not very tasty.  The chicken was breaded frozen and the peas tasted like frozen peas also.  Mashed potatoes were instant.  I'd value the dinner worth about $5.95 for what was received.  Thousand island dressing was sour and way too much mayo.   Still looking for that fresh cooked food instead of the quick and easy frozen.  Don't think I'll return again.",

Unfortunately, the wait for a table is WAY TOO LONG, and then the wait for service is WORSE.  We got there a little after 10:30 am, and the waitress said the wait would be about a half hour.  So we waited outside.  She was very nice, giving us coffee and refills while we waited.  After about 30 minutes, she asked us to stand inside the restaurant, saying it would speed-up seating. We then waited another 15 minutes.  We finally sat down at a table, and ordered our food.  Our food did not arrive until noon!  I had the bacon stack, which was tasty.

    "text": "The fish sandwich and gyros are great, if you can tolerate the gnats flying around.  I was in last weekend and two weekends prior, when I first noticed the gnats and traps around the drink machines.  The traps were active and working.  These gnats breed in stagnating water, but naturally migrate to food, garbage and drinks.  \n\nLast weekend the swarm around the drinks was a cloud.  I brought it to management's attention and some woman disappeared from the counter and didn't return.  I surveyed the food prep area and didn't see traps, so either the swarm was \"contained\" and none were needed, or the staff didn't want the traps in view.  The traps at the drink machine were hidden behind the machines and had doubled or tripled in count,  with activity around  the trap openings.  Notably I didn't see any houseflies, so I don't think this is a garbage problem.  \n\nThe food is generally good, and costs about 125% of what it would cost to go to pdq for casual fast dining (why I give two stars I stead of one).  Food occasionally comes out as it's prepared rather than at once - several occasion my wife or I have told the other go \"go ahead and eat.\"  This place is close enough to visit on foot, but I won't return.",

    "text": "While the food and service are excellent (loved the chicken pad thai, mango rice + a very friendly & humorous waitress), the parking & location was a total nightmare. The restaurant is often overcrowded (the size of the restaurant is small) and waits can be an issue. Also, they leave the front door open, which allows cold air to fill the restaurant. Basically, once inside, it's easy to feel claustrophobic and chilly. \n\nOverall, the location isn't good at all. I'm sure college students love it close to their respective campuses, but it has a negative effect on the restaurant's ambiance and culture. \n\nHowever, the experience (once inside) is appreciable. A four-star rating if not for sub-par external criteria.",

On Fri 8/29 /2015 a visiting friend from the Bay area and myself had called @ 8 :20 for the closing of the place and was told 9:30 kitchen would be closed. We get there about 9 p.m.and the staff members are walking out the door so we proceed to walk in for the open sign is still on once in we see other staff members gathered at the door and the host who I had recently spoken to cleaning out the money drawer. I am an advocate patron of this establishment and very unhappy with this place. After giving constant raves to friends/strangers/visitors for the food and delishes pomegranate martinis by the amazing mixologist Ricky there! I don't think I will be recommending anymore!",

I told her I would like to know the price and if the order is correct cause they have delivered the wrong order before.  She proceeded to demand for my credit card number after that she said just forget it you don't get no order and hung up.  Like really.  Even though they have messed my order up before like I said there food isn't that bad and they deliver. Only Asian place that will where I live.  but for this to happen they will never get my service again.  They really need to act like professionals or at least get some one else on the phone. I orginally gave this 1 star but thought that wasnt fair cause the food is ok.  Egg rolls  and the pork noodle soup is not bad. Could use a little more flavor but overall not bad. Again Just the service is really bad.",

    "text": "For a deteriorating downtown, it can be difficult to find lively & quality places to dine at. Mizu Sushi Bar, off Wash Ave., while not terrible, conforms to this sense of apathy that is killing a once bustling & eccentric area of St. Louis.\n\nFrom a service perspective, we maybe saw our waitress twice throughout our meal here - once to take our order, and another to pick up the bill. The empty chairs & tables during (what should be) a very busy lunch hour added to the poor atmosphere that we experienced. We had contrastingly high hopes for the food, as we were the only people in there, so we expected more care & time put into our meals. Unfortunately, this wasn't the case: my salad floated in a pool of creamy ginger sauce, our sushi rolls fell apart at the slightest touch, and my rice was overcooked & mushy. I'll give kudos to the Mongolian Chicken - it was quite good; well fried & seasoned perfectly.\n\nHowever, there are much better (and less depressing) places to find sushi in St. Louis. Spare yourself, and pass on Mizu.",

    "text": "If you're going to eat at an izakaya joint, you should be a somewhat adventurous eater.  That being said, I found nothing adventurous about the menu at Izayaka Ren.\n\nI was so excited to hear that St. Louis was finally getting an izakaya restaurant.  But after eating there last weekend, I'm so disappointed.\n\nFirst off, there are only about 4 different sakes on the menu.  All those 30+ bottles on the shelves in the bar?  Those are for \"display only,\" we were told.  \n\nThe agedashi tofu was drowning in broth.  I ordered \"agedashi tofu,\" not \"agedashi tofu soup.\"\n\nThe vegetable croquettes would be better as smaller, silver-dollar size bites.  Not pancake size.\n\nThey were out of onigiri.  ...which is just a rice ball, grilled.  So, um, why would a izakaya/sushi place be OUT of rice?\n\nWe sat at the sushi bar and saw many rolls off to the side already pre-made.  We imagine many of the cooked items we ordered we pre-made as well.  (As was probably the \"sold out' onigiri.)  I imagine the raw scallops were wrapped in bacon and kept in the fridge days ago instead of being made fresh.\n\nThe skewered scallops wrapped in bacon were fine - but anything wrapped in bacon is usually fine.  With that in mind, bacon wrapped mochi is divine and I highly suggest this restaurant start serving that.  Made fresh to order.\n\nThe fried squid we ordered was tasty, but really greasy.\n\nDon't bother ordering the skewered quail eggs wrapped in prosciutto.  They're nothing to write home about.\n\nAlso, we saw the cooks grilling chicken on a grill that had fishy mackerel grilling on it moments prior.  ...i.e, that chicken's going to taste awfully fishy.\n\nWaitstaff needs help.  First, our waitress greeted us with \"do you want waters or sodas?\"  Not, \"hello.\"  Not even, \"may I get you something to drink?\"  Waitstaff also needs to stop entering for their shift through the front door.  It doesn't look professional.  They should arrive through the backdoor.  \n\nMy suggestions for the owners:  Polish up your staff, create a more adventurous menu (takoyaki would be a nice start), have later hours, offer a much MUCH larger selection of sake, lay off the tired sushi items, and make things fresh to order.  Make it more of an izakaya sake BAR with good food, not some average west county sushi restaurant.\n\nMy suggestions for potential patrons:  Expand your pallette beyond California rolls and tempura.  Also, don't bother coming here until the owners change some things.  Also, stop calling it \"tapas\" for christsake.",

    "text": "Our group had intended to sit out in the patio, but since It was too hot, we decided to sit inside the restaurant.  First impression; it was noisy and the decor needed some upgrading.  Our waiter came to our table and immediately wanted us to order appetizers even though the rest of the group was still parking their cars (incidentally don't go on a Wednesday in the summer, the parking lot is full due to people going to the farmer's market).  The waiter also behaved unprofessionally and kept interrupting and then didn't show up. When I ask if there is a charge for a substitution on the side dish, he said it would only be $1 extra. After we placed our order, it took a long time (at least 1/2 hour or more) to get our food. The dishes were just typical bar food and not particularly warm when they finally arrived at our table.  There's a great selection of good, quality beer, though. When we got our check, I noticed that I was charged $4.50 for the substitution of the side order.  When I questioned the waiter in the front of our group, he said that's what they charge and made no attempt to contact his manager to change it. He merely said that \"you got an extra large order\".  I didn't want an extra large order so again I ask if he would change it and he just shrugged his shoulders and left.  \nA few days later, I phoned the manager to let him know about our experience. He appeared to be concerned about the treatment we received. I mentioned to him that it had been my turn to pick a venue for our group and frankly, no one in our group was particularly pleased with the service.  I told him that I was calling because I don't like to put bad reviews on yelp and hoped that he would give extra training to his employee. He apologized profusely and said he would send me a gift certificate. I told that that it wasn't necessary but that it would be appreciated.  He said that he'd send one anyway and I gave him my address. I never heard back from him - not even a note. That was three weeks ago so here's my review.",

    "text": "First time at 1911 Smoke House, it's Saturday night (8/13/16) around 8pm and my wife and I ordered take out and just finished dinner.  We ordered the garlic parmesan wings, the brisket and the half ribs.  The wings and brisket was very good BUT the ribs were the worst I've EVER had.  Most ribs want to fall of the bone, this one didn't want  leave it.  It was like eating beef jerky but unfortunately the beef jerky was softer!  It was like 2 day old ribs that they just heated up. We honestly could not even chew the ends and the middle was so gummy.  I honestly don't make a fuss let alone go online to write a review but how the cook could have served and sold it to us warrants this review!  It's really such a shame because the place is so nice and the other items we ordered was very good.   -jose",

    "text": "Underwhelmed.  My husband and I celebrated our anniversary at the Farmhaus last week.  The decor is bland, beige walls, uninteresting art, too bright, the room echos and is very loud, I couldn't hear the waiter and I was trying to read his lips.  The menu was unexciting.  We ordered the nachos app and it was just a pile of sweet potato chips with crumbled bleu cheese and bacon bits on top and drizzled with BBQ sauce, it wasn't a very a cohesive dish.  The conch fritters were good though.   My husband ordered the most expensive dish on the menu, the ribeye for $33.00  It was tough and not very tasty and for $33.00 he expected more than an ordinary ribeye on top of mashed potatoes.  I ordered the Pompano fish entre\u00e9, it was just okay but moderately priced.  The dessert was good, we split the lemon pudding cake, the wine was good.  We were never offered coffee.   After all the hype I heard about this place, I  really expected to have a great experience, but it was just eh, okay.  I don't think we'll put this place in our rotation for dinner.  I'm really sad about that too.",

    "text": "Poor service but it depends entirely on which waiter.  We've gone there often and the food is better than average (with one exception see below) and had good service, but this trip, it was almost 10 minutes to even get a waiter to come by and give chips and salsa and get drink order (I was 1 minute from just getting up and leaving).  The food came for the 3 of us, but not a plate in sight to eat off of when we clearly stated in the beginning that we were sharing the 3 dishes.  Watching him with other tables, he was clearly only paying attention as it came time to leave a tip, but not at other times during the meal.  That being said, we have been happy with other wait staff on other visits.\n\nThe Shrimp Nachos were a huge disappointment, the limp nachos and less than generous amount of shrimp were buried under a large amount of lettuce.  I've never seen lettuce on nachos.\n\nWe'll be back, but we will watch which waiter serves us.",

    "text": "I've been to the Jerk Hut twice, once inside and once outside. If I had been rating this place just based on the inside experience, I would have given it three stars. However, my outside experience was pretty damned abominable. When I ate inside with my boyfriend and two friends, our experience was fairly pleasant. The place is pretty small and shabby (dare I say a little dirty?), but the service was prompt and the employees friendly. My Jerk Shrimp was not as amazing as I had expected, but still palatable to say the least. I got a pineapple soda to wash it down, and I was happy. \n\nThe outside experience, on the other hand, was quite the opposite of pleasant. The hostess was a little abrupt with us, since we questioned the $5 per-person \"entertainment fee\" and $6 PER SIX-PACK \"corkage fee\". Now please, let me define for you a corkage fee (thank you, Answer.com): A charge exacted at a restaurant for every bottle of liquor served that was not bought on the premises. The Jamaican Jerk Hut does not sell any alcohol, so this is a misleading use of the term \"corkage fee\"... they aren't losing out on any alcohol sales, since they don't have a liquor license. The only thing they did that was worthy of monetary compensation was provide us with a bucket of ice. That really pissed us off. \n\nSo even before we sat down to eat and drink OUR OWN BEER, we had already shelled out $21 between three of us. (Good thing we brought another six-pack in our backpack that they didn't notice...) Let me just say that I wouldn't mind paying a $5 cover to see an act worthy of that money. However, instead of hearing authentic Jamaican music, which I was hoping for, there was a white guy with dreads who was pretty much the worst Bob Marley impostor I've ever seen. Fake Jamaican accent and everything. There isn't much that I despise more than white people faking Jamaican accents... or anyone faking any accent, for that matter, and trying seriously to get away with it. Anyway, I digress... I'll just say that the music was not up to par.\n\nWhile we were sitting there trying to endure the terrible music and forget about the through-the-roof prices, we were kind of paying attention to our mostly bland and disappointing food. It seemed like they were mass-preparing meals, except they took three times as long to come out than a mass-prepared meal would. The only thing that I really enjoyed was the coconut shrimp appetizer. The sauce was a little too sweet, but mostly good. The jerk chicken with rice and beans was kind of dry and not as spicy as I would have liked. Very, very disappointing. The fried plantains weren't even good... they were greasy. Yuck. I might give this place a try again, but it will NEVER be outside.",

The Ranchero Classic Breakfast Burrito that I ordered sounded great on paper, I was able to add chicken and was really pumped up about starting my day with a nice wholesome burrito!  \n\nThe execution is where this fell flat.  When I got to my car, i realized that the burrito was just slightly warmer than room temp.  The \"grilling\" process did not sear or seal the tortilla, and there were no grill marks or cheese melting that would evidence any type of honest grilling process.   \n\nThe idea of eating room temp eggs and chicken really weirded me out... but I had a bout $8 bucks invested in this roll of disappointment, I was already at my office and did not have an alternative breakfast...so I begrudgingly ate most of it.\n\nIf I go back for breakfast, I will stick with the smoothies.   those seem to be easy enough to pull off and very nutritious.",

    "text": "'Have had better' is a pretty good assessment of the place but with a few things to note.\n\nFirst - It's a bar that happens to serve food.  This place is a little dirty but that's part of the atmosphere as noted in another review.  Not roach dirty of course.  So if you're looking for a decent sized bar and bar food then this place is for you.  If you want a decent sit-down meal however...\n\nOur waitress was pretty cute but a little neglectful and forgot my fries and water.  Meh, it's a bar.  When I mentioned it she at least offered to get the fries.\n\nSue K. noted in her review \"Had some high expectations for this place with the reviews I read and the opinions I heard and I ended up highly disappointed. We ordered baby back ribs and there was a good portion but the ribs were dry as anything.\"  I would agree.  I had the babybacks and they were pretty dry.  My partner wasn't thrilled with her sampler platter either so she asked to speak to someone about it.  The manager came over and explained that they cook their ribs to 'have some tug' - meaning that they aren't 'over cooked' as he said and fall off the bone.  So make sure you have some good teeth.  Personally I prefer 'fall off the bone' ribs.  I would also note that there wasn't much taste either.  I wasn't too thrilled with the sauce - which was on the side.\n\nThe owner's girlfriend (Jennifer) came over and wanted to speak with us about our experience.  For this I was really surprised and really appreciated her concern.  The owners at least don't run the place like a bar which is a good thing in my book.  She refunded the full meal and requested we come back so they could make it up to us.  I probably won't go back but I do appreciate the offer.  Looks like it would be a nice local bar though.  The owners are pretty cool and I wish them luck!",

She literally blocked everyone behind and in front of her and they were all yelling at each other. So yeah, don't bother trying to park if it's busy. When you go in, you order on touch screen, similar to like at Wawa. I ordered a salad, and maybe I should have gone with the stir fry. The salads start at like $10 and anything you want to add to it is extra. So this salad ended up being like $12 without any meat. It was slow getting my order and when it was finally called and I went up the girl working said they didn't call my number. I sat back down and then she figured out they actually did. I took my salad back to work to eat because I had already used my whole lunch break at this point. I wasn't particularly impressed with it. For the price, I thought this salad was going to be something huge I could never finish, but it was just normal sized. The salad did taste good and the ingredients seemed fresh and high quality. I really liked their pumpernickel croutons. I got mozzarella cheese on my salad, and I guess this could be considered a good thing to some, but the cheese was seriously in giant balls, which was not enjoyable to me.",

Well I was hungry so I decided to call and make sure they were closed only to find out that they are open and asked what time they were open they were so rude and never answered what time so we went home dropped off people came in and they were open so we went. When we did go we didn't know that we were suppose to sit ourselves so we finally did and then the waiter took forever to come. We were about ready to get up and leave when she finally came and got our order. So we ordered our drink but when we asked for a few more minutes to look at the menu and we did it took a very long time for the waiter to come back. We ordered and it took quite a long time to get our food considering we only ordered a hamburger and chicken sandwhich. We finally got our food which was decent to say the least and then took more time to get our check. If we go back we need to make sure that they actually are open they need lighting on the outside.",

It was such a great morning and we happily sauntered a couple blocks over to Puckett's.  We were told there would be a 15 or 20 minute wait for a table for the two of us.  No problem.  It starts to be a problem when it's a half hour, there are empty tables AND people coming in after us have been seated.  OK, it's a beautiful day, we're happy to be here, it'll be fine.    No, no it wasn't...our server was very pleasant and kept our coffee cups filled but apologized several times over for the VERY long time our order took.  We finally got our order only to be disappointed in the food.  The delicious pancakes I was looking forward to were burnt on the bottom and our order of sausage gravy and biscuits mediocre at best.  Just so deflating all the around.  The server did take the pancakes off the bill which we appreciated but will probably look for other breakfast options next time.",

    "text": "Ok I'm not gonna lie, this place really kinda freaked me out after staying for a couple of days. Let's start with the decor. What I learned is that it is the largest hotel in the country with no casino, so this place as you can imagine is immense, and very confusing. Although you get the lay of the land at some point, every different section of the hotel looks exactly the same. So although you may be in The Cascades lobby Vs. The Garden Conservatory it's all the exact same indoor \"bio-dome\" as we came to call it. At first I enjoyed the indoor/outdoor theme of the hotel. Waterfalls, koi ponds, rivers with boats....wait a boat? Yes that's right there is a boat tour around the \"delta river.\" This was my first confused moment. This place is like Disney meets the MGM grand, meets a bio dome, meets a convention center. Real flowers and trees, fake rocks with music emanating from them. The indoor/outdoor thing started to become a little uncanny and I was happy they had two outdoor pools to choose from. The pool in Cascades I very much enjoyed, plenty of chairs to lounge all day and a big enough space to feel like you are in your own little world. Food and drink service available, and a hot tub, if the Nashville sun isn't heating you up enough. BUT let me tell you about the food in this place. If you are going to create a hotel where you intend me to never leave, please feed me well. Although we didn't try the steak house, which they say is the best, I tried almost everything else and it was near inedible. Solerio the Mexican restaurant gets a star, if that. Cascades, also gets one star if I must, i couldn't believe how rude one of the staff was one day, and the sushi place Wasabi's is passable, although I ate vegetarian. This place was an interesting place to stay, certainly stimulating, but it got a little old. And if you stay here make other arrangements for food, you will be upset at your empty wallet and stomach.",

You can order the same dish three times and have three completely different experiences.  Sometimes it's great, sometimes there are ingredients missing and sometimes the food will be so bland that you'll want to fall asleep in your pollo.  I was promised tarragon!  I shouldn't have to pay $16 for a dish and add my own!\n\nAnd speaking of prices, apparently everything just went up about three bucks per plate over the past few months while the quality has just taken a nosedive.  Shameful.\n\nSome quick dish reviews from our last visit:\nPappardelle con Funghi e Salciccia - roughly translated to pasta with mushrooms and fatty sausage.  Save your $17 and just get some Jimmy Dean links and a bottle of cooking sherry for the same experience.\n\nPollo with Sundried Tomatoes & Artichokes - see above.  One of the ingredients was a complete lie.\n\nBolognese Anything - pretty much mac & cheese with bits of hot dog.  Yes that's an exaggeration but the flavor profile is spot on.\n\nSo yeah, this is a place I used to love but has slid downhill over the years at an alarming rate.

Weren't aware of the BYOB policy; therefore it was a very sober dinner. The atmosphere was good but where we sat we could see car's headlights reflected off of the glass as they pulled in. The service was good but could of been better. Overall it wasn't terrible but wasn't great either. Might be back another time just for the pasta! Price range was ok? Family of three around $100.",

We waited over an hour (aren't hosts supposed to overestimate wait times, not under?).\n\nThe wait wasn't worth it. For a place that boasts about their homemade breads, it's shocking they don't have better than smuckers jelly packets to pair with their baked goods. The shrimp and grits was good but not great, and the bread served with it was legitimately bad. Dry, crusty, literally just stale slices adorning the plate. My partner got a breakfast burrito - it was meh, nothing special.\n\nI got a juice given their namesake and it tasted like concentrate!!!! It was a special, orange-pineapple-mango. I would not get a juice unless you're looking for a glass of sugar.\n\nBad. Skip. Go to Willa Jean's for a far superior/tastier breakfast experience.",

    "text": "I've visited this location several times and each time I return, I ask myself \"why\"? This particular location is the most inconsistent in service, appearance and quality. As a franchised restaurant, management, HQ and employees need to pay attention.  Customer service: greet your customer with friendliness. Say \"please and thank you\" Those words go a long way. If it's an inconvenience to tend to customers, you're in the the wrong line of work.  The line staff need to work together to make production consistent,  efficient and accurate. Appearance: OMG! Wipe down the tables! Designate an employee to monitor the dining area. Keep tables clear, pick up or sweep crumbs from the floor. This visit I witnessed an employee walk past and over 2 napkins that were on the floor. If the dining area looks like crap, what does the food prep area look like? Food: I've had lukewarm burrito bowls & cold tacos.....pay attention!!!\n\nI've given this location so many chances....MAYBE if the franchisee noticed slow sales numbers they'd reconsider who to put in place in management of their investment.",

    "text": "We had went to a movie at the nearby Carmike Cinemas and decided to check out what was nearby... as beer fans we decided to give the new Cool Springs Brewery a try. Once inside, we headed for the bar (we'd been here once before when it was Guidos). It took awhile for us to get the bartender to come over to us... she was busy talking with a group of guys. Once we did get her attention, we'd ordered a beer, but one of the \"guys\" yelled something out to her and she left our beers where the tap was and went to talk to him... not great. \n\nOnce we finally got our Fatback Amber's... they were pretty tasty. We were hungry for lunch and we drank our entire beer + 10 minutes before we could get the bartenders attention (and for the record... the only people in the bar were the 3-4 guys she was talking to and my husband and I... so it wasn't busy). We finally got a menu and I asked her to just wait a second because we wanted to order... we got the white pizza (something we'd had before when it was Guidos... and loved) and two more fatback amber's. \n\nAbout 20 minutes later we got our pizza.... and it wasn't what we'd remembered. The pizza was bland and didn't have nearly enough pesto or ricotta.\n\nIt took us another 15 minutes after we were done with our pizza and 2nd beers to get her attention and get our check. It was getting pretty annoying. \n\nWe really did like their beer and the location/decor/vibe are all good... but the service and the pizza left a lot to be desired. I'd like to say we'll be back, but I'm not certain we will, and it makes me sad because they have a lot of potential to make it fantastic... but right now they're missing the mark.",

The mushrooms were huge and slimy - reminded me of Pizza Hut.\n\nThe husband's red fish was good.\n\nThe server was stretched pretty thin.  I got annoyed when it took 15 minutes to place our order, then, upon a moment's hesitation while reading a line in the menu the server was urging us on (\"Ok...whoever's ready...speak up now) as if he was doing us a favor by stopping at our table to take our order.\n\nOverall?

When I told the waiter he acted like nothing was wrong and said \"yeah I had it a couple times, I like the beef better\". Mind you when I ordered it he expounded on the awesomeness of the in house made burger process. My service was mediocre as the waiter seemed extremely distracted and wasn't taking much time explaining things to me and my companion as it was our first time at the restaurant.

The biscuits came out cold. A \"side\" of bacon is $5 dollars and you get seriously 2 slices. Service was very very slow. Wouldn't recommend unless you have 3.5 hours or more  to kill for brunch.",

This place serves breakfast, lunch and dinner so i dont know why they would not be open. I left and came back the next day. Me and my cousin ordered two chicken wing platters. The chicken had absolutely no flavor or season. The greens i have had way better, The mac and cheese was ok but i have had better as well. Cabbage was horrid and the yams was really good. Lemon and strawberry cake was really good as well. Icing is very sweet though. I would only go back to get a slice of cake if i ever went back",

    "text": "After reviewing the menu online, I decided to check this place out with a friend.  It looked like they had an eclectic, varied menu with a nice selection of beers and wine.  Several people I know have been here before and it came highly recomended.  Unfortunatly, though, my experience left much to be desired.\n     We arrived around 5 pm, at which time it appeared all of the servers were arriving as well.  We were seated promptly, however it took about 15 minutes for a server to appear.  Both my friend and I ordered the \"Pub Steak\" which were brought out reasonably quick.  The presentation was non-existent, simply a hunk of meat with french fries.  I ordered mine med-rare and received it well done.  The waitress did nothing to rectify this except apologize (I had barely eaten half).  \n     The best part is this, I soon discovered a chip in my wine glass and upon showing it to the waitress she asked if I would like another.  I replied yes and was brought a new glass with the old wine poured into it.  Unbelievable!  How incredibly un-professional.  I pointed this out to the waitress and got another apology.\n     We recieved a bill with no concessions.  No manager came to speak with us.  Nothing was done to rectify this experience.  Needless to say, I won't be visiting this establishment again.",

The food and drinks were not worth the 45 minute wait.\n\nThe only thing we liked about the food was the presentation - at least it looked pretty.  I had the Cajun Chicken Pasta, and there was nothing Cajun or spicy about it.  Very disappointed.  My wife had the Seafood Mac & Cheese, which was mediocre and a bit too runny.\n\nThe pitcher of Margaritas was small and packed with ice.  We each got a least a typical glass's worth, but it was nothing special.\n\nOur waitress was admittedly inexperienced.  However, her personality and lack of attentiveness didn't help her cause.  \n\nSadly, I see no reason to go back.",

I wasn't greeted by anyone and everyone seemed busy, so I just headed to the register. The redhead working the register was very friendly and nice. My iced latte was very tasty. I sat down to make my call, and it lasted till just after 3pm. Employees had been sweeping while I was on the phone, but I had no idea that the cafe closed at 3pm. Just after I got off the phone, a woman wearing a green shirt came around the corner by the counter, clasped her hands together, and basically shouted at me, \"M'am, we are CLOSED.\" Instead of approaching me and politely informing me one-on-one, she apparently felt like that was an appropriate way to treat a customer. This was the first time I've been in the location, and although I loved the service the redhead provided, I will not be back. I do not like feeling like I am being kicked out of a locally-run establishment because I honestly did not know about the shop's hours. If retaining patrons is an objective of Companion's company, that employee needs to be reminded.",

I am very impressed with his level of professionalism and customer service. I give the restaurant FIVE stars in this area and hope my next experience will be better and my overall rating will change also! My current rating is just for our one experience and the food we received that time. \n\nWell, my husband and I were hoping for great things at the new Padaro Beach Grill. Frankly, it was the same old Padaro; over-priced and mediocre food! By the time you order a burger and add everything on it, which is $.75 extra for EACH side, plus order your fries, which are also separate, you've spent over $11.00! The food is ok, but my fish and chips were quite greasy and not worth the price! The one plus, they cut down the hedge so there is an ocean view now. Think I'll skip it and go into SB for a great burger or fish and chips with a view of the ocean at a better price!",

It shouldn't be too hard to re-construct it to make it easier to get through. More importantly, the customer service needs to be improved.  I went there recently and ordered coffee, and clearly stated that I wanted it with no sugar.  The girl at the window handed me the coffee, which was loaded with sugar.  I went through again, and asked for what I ordered.  Another employee gave me another coffee, made as I originally ordered, but she made no apology, and seemed annoyed. This is at least the second time that I received an incorrect order at this location. The other three McDonald's locations I go to, in less prestigious neighborhoods, have much better customer service.",

    "text": "First off. This rating is for service and not the food. I have to stress that first. That being said I can't begin to say how disappointed I am in the service (or lack there of) I received tonight. I actually frequent this restaurant and have for years. Tonight I attempted to bring 7 of my friends along to enjoy dinner here for a birthday celebration. When we arrived we asked what the wait time would be. The hostess who was very nice told us 20-25 minutes for indoor or we could be seated immediately outdoor. The 8 of us were talking and another woman arrived at the hostess station and told her it would not be 25 min but 45 to an hour. So we asked to be seated outside. The hostess explained that if we chose to eat outside if it rained there would be no guarantee we could be moved indoors. We agreed and that was fine. The hostess then mentioned to the other young lady (who I would later find out was named laney) that we chose outside and she was worried about the rain. Laney told her \"well that isn't our problem\". During the time that I was speaking to the hostess the other young woman kept repeating what the hostess was telling me. I'm an adult and I can hear plenty well so I knew what she was saying the first time and didn't need a third party repeating it. \n\nWhile the hostess sat the rest of my party I stuck around to ask the young lady if there was a problem or if we had done something to annoy or offend her. She simply stated she wasn't referring to us she was talking about something else. Ok. \n\nAfter the hostess sat us, no one ever arrived to take our order. No one even brought us water or asked if we wanted a drink. Nothing. To be so worried about us possibly eating in the rain, yet no one cared to try to get our order in a timely manner.  \n\nAfter waiting with no sign of service what so ever, I picked all of our menus up and returned them to the hostess. I have never been so disappointed in the service I've received here. It's one of my favorite places to eat but tonight it left a bad taste in my mouth.",

Also I was in a good mood from pokemon hunting.\n\nAs long as the coffee tastes good I thought. It was.  We had ordered eiskaffe and dirty thai ger.  I was so impressed that I was quickly formulating a stellar yelp review for what was about to be my favorite, I repeat, my **favorite** coffee bar in Tampa.  So so close, but then I sent my friend for another round.  Shortly thereafter he asks if we could move onto somewhere where it was, in his words, \"more welcoming.\"\n\nThat's where I draw the line.

I don't need more than 15 mins to figure out that there isn't much I would bother ordering from the menu. I got the kale and egg salad which was totally bland. I waited 10 mins to flag someone for salt and pepper to add some flavor. Then it took 5 more mins to get it. There were plenty of empty tables so  not sure what the problem was other than our server was NEVER around and rarely checked in on us. It took over an hour to get a kale salad and for my dining partner to get his burger. \n  The original tired hands has been more attentive in general and at least they have really good bread and cheese.

My last stop in I was disappointed to see that they had taken their turkey options off of the menu. If pork and beef are not in your diet, your menu options are extremely limited. Especially if you would like an AMAZING Croquenut.... Slightly bummed about the menu change, and disappointed that it changed to appeal to a smaller dietary group.",

As I look around, people are really enjoying themselves. The atmosphere is really friendly, but I also see a lot of food left on the plate. I ordered the Belgium waffle and the aroma of the salt on the waffle was very overwhelming. Long story short, the food was not up to par. I was very disappointed. The water wasn't cold, many items on the menu were sold out, and the ones they did have, they didn't allow any modifications to. The coffees were small and it was very hot inside. I really wanted to like this place. Unfortunately we didn't receive good service nor did we get a chance to even order what we wanted.",

    "text": "uhhhh I hate to go to 3 on them because the first time I had them I thought wow what a cute little sushi bar with some pretty decent sushi in South Reno..  that being said.. Wow it is Saturday night @ 6:30pm and there is only one other couple here besides us.. the sushi chefs seemed real nice and asked what you would like as you were finishing instead of when you were completely  done which is a big plus. THEN as I am enjoying this nice little place with a very friendly staff I am thinking i am catching a wave of some thing bad smelling like cleaner... ummm still left over all enjoying the place :) \ncame here again a month later and well can not give this place more then 3 now because we were Sat at the sushi bar right by the kitchen ( which is where they make the Chinese cuisine ( as this is a sushi / Chinese restaurant)  again a Saturday night at 6 and no one in there at all except for  my husband and I.. Umm  this means great service with 2 sushi chefs standing right there right? NO dead wrong they thought it  would be much better for them to stand there talking with each other while we waited 5 minutes before they even looked at us (hence this is at the sushi bar ) it took an hour for us to each get 4 rolls from our slow chef. then the over powering smell I smelt last time came pouring over us it was the smell of vinegar and I mean it smelt like they dumped a gallon right in front of us, I could not take it I had to force myself to walk away from my sushi and pay the bill and leave. I would not recommend them to a friend",

Overall although fresh, the food had no flavor at all. The bread and flavored oil were good to start, our wine (the Sangiovese) was good and our waiter seemed like a good dude (can't remember his name). That's where it ended, though. The rigatoni was undercooked (even for al dente) and the tagliatelle was over cooked. The bolognese was bland and the rigatoni didn't taste right at all.

As we stood there waiting for her to grab the menus I couldn't help but to notice a strong dirty mop water stench. Thankfully when we left the entry way it didn't carry into the dining room. The remodel is impressive looking. We were sat at a booth. Looking over the menu I was surprised at how limited it was. As long as you make what you offer well no biggie. I ordered the mushroom swiss burger and a beer. My husband ordered the \"knuckle sandwich\", ( tri-tip sandwich served French dip style). My son ordered the chicken strips and we all got French fries as our side. Jesse, our server was nice enough but in the loud dining room you couldn't hear a word he said. I was more annoyed that he didn't take the initiative to speak up than about the noise. The beer came out, although tasty it wasn't cold enough at all. The food came out within a reasonable amount of time. My husband's \"Knuckle Sandwich\" was delicious! That is what the two stars are for. My burger was shockingly small and probably the blandest burger I have ever eaten. My son's chicken strips tasted like they floured them...and that was it... also, no hint of seasoning. The fries are your run of the mill freezer to fryer. I hope they step it up and are successful.",

We were seated in the corner for two people, however, we thought that the table was kind of small for us.\n\nWe ordered the mussels ($14) as our appetizers. Good thing, we finished the appetizer first before our entrees came because you couldn't have fit 3 plates on that table. The mussels were okay.. We definitely had better. I guess, we were a little disappointed that the mussels weren't bigger since they should be in season? I mean, the Italian market is like right there... and they sell a lot of fresh seafood there. Anyways, as my entree, I decided on the seafood pescatore ($26) and my bf got the chicken alfredo ($19). I felt that my dish wasn't as great. There was good amount of seafood but the sauce was a little off for me. My bf's dish was mediocre at best. It didn't look that appetizing nor did it taste that great. It was really bland and we added salt and pepper so that it could taste a little better. \n\nHonestly, we were sort of disappointed since a friend did recommend this place. It could be that our friend has bad taste or it could be, what we ordered? We decided to skip desserts since we weren't really satisfied with our meals. I'm glad that we had a groupon because we were not happy with our meal. We don't mind paying the price for good food but we felt that it wasn't worth it here.

The tuna was cut into big chunks so it made us feel like we were biting into a hunk of raw fish. \nWe also had a rice bowl. That was good but not good enough for me to want to order it again. \nI was really hoping to love it here and surprise my boyfriend with a sushi burrito, at his job nearby, but I didn't want to take the chance and order him one and he not like it either.  \nOh well. It was a unique experience with good company. \nAll the ingredients were very fresh and the restraurant was clean.",

Our table of 6 got there about 8pm, and finally got pizza around 10pm.  The waitress seemed apologetic and so did some other random older lady that came by to check up on us.  But, if your customers are waiting 2 hours for pizza, how about throw em a bone and put some cheese bread or something on the table?  Maybe take a little off the tab?  Nope.  They gave a receipt/coupon for half off a pizza on our next visit.... but guess what, I'm not coming back.   Not unless I'm desperate.  \n\nAs for the actual pizza:  it was good.  Being a Chicagoan though, I'd put this somewhere between Giordano's and Connie's, with Giordano's winning.   I'm a Lou Malnati's girl, so nothing beats that of course.  But if we're talking Nashville, save yourself some grief and go to Desano's - better pizza, less wait.  \n\nAnd btw, what's with the bland decor of this place.  Sucks that this place is supposed to be representative of my hometown.",

Our food was flavorless and when my boyfriend asked why the bbq sauce wasn't cooked in the manager proudly said, \"That's not the Red Hot and Blue way\". He told us how their meat is smoked with nothing on it. So, you get a bunch of flavorless meat on your plate. We both ordered the Five Meat Treat; they gave us plenty of food. Unfortunately it wasn't food that either one of us wanted to eat. The service was fine, just a little slow but our server told us that he was new and he seemed high-school aged; I'm such a sucker for kids who work that I give him a pass. Because the manager knew he wasn't satisfied with the food they took his meal off the check.",

Not enough ketchup NEVER any strawberry jelly (because yes not everyone loves grape). But the main reason that they get such a poor rating is because i dont think i have ever been there and the staff didnt have an attitude all the way up to the manager! If you are traveling and leaving out the city to head towards Ms then may suggest another popeyes because you may get hot fresh chicken or you may just get the wrong order as i have a few times.

The crispy tofu was too mushy on the inside. The Beef and Tendon soup was very aromatic, which tricked me. Once I tasted it, it was completely lacking in flavor. It tasted like generic beef broth with some star anise thrown in. \nThey did have good service and the place was pretty clean. They have a TV to watch games and some people were studying there. \nThe boba drinks weren't bad. They have all the common flavors. Started at $3.75 for a small, add 50 cents for boba and add 50 cents to make it a large. I think $4.75 is pretty expensive for blended ice and powdered flavoring with a little boba thrown in.",

My boyfriend is a bartender and I am a chef, and understand having bad days, not wanting to be there, wanting to have all your side work done and wanting to leave as soon as you can at the end of your shift. One of the bartenders was already breaking things down when we ordered dinner at 8:40, then both of them started completely breaking down the bar by 9,scrubbing, pulling out the grates, etc etc. We both would have had a few more drinks, and we were not the only ones there, so this was not the case of we were the last ones in the bar and didn't realize everyone wanted to go home . There is a way to make your customers happy, and quietly do your side work and not alienating them. We didn't want to make small talk with them, we just wanted service and to not smell cleaning products while we ate. We typically tip over 20%. We did still tip, just not as generously  as we usually do. Though the food was good, we will most likely not return because of how horrible the bar staff lacked in professionalism.",

The waiter skipped the second course entirely, and then said it wasn't a course at all when we pointed this out.  We sought clarification and the waiter was indeed wrong and did not understand the set menu.  Another waiter stepped in, offered to serve the second course after the third, and to give us complimentary champagne, more wine, money off our check, and extra food.  \n\nThe solution was not ideal - the order of dishes was off, we did not really want the extras, and the \"champagne\" was horrid, but it was New Year's Eve and we wanted a pleasant evening, so said fine.  Most of the dishes were excellent. However, our final tab did not show the promised deduction.  \n\nOverall, a bit of a disappointment.",

I can tell how the crowd is turned over so quick.  The bulk of the food is prepared ahead of time.  The wife had waffles and bacon.  Waffles were good but bacon had been sitting for a while.  I had eggs benedict.  Home fries were good.  Eggs done nicely. English muffins hadn't been thoroughly cooked.  The sauce was a whole different story.  Absolutely horrible.  Looked like someone had melted butter and thrown some spice in it. One plus is the wait staff was friendly. I left my tip on the table and when paying the check I was asked if I was leaving a tip on the card.

This is not true. I've never seen plantains on a taco in a Mexican restaurant in Texas. Also, Texas barbecue is largely smoked brisket served sans bacon in a sandwich. Or taco. Simply having Texas toast and Tequila (albeit a fabulous selection) does not make you an authentic Texas or Mexican food establishment. And plantains certainly don't. \n\nPlus, their customer service hasn't been good after going there three separate times. Each time and shift, the manager has been dismissive and the waiter or waitress has been over-worked. Which is why I wasn't too upset that after 20 minutes of having no ice tea refilled, I wasn't upset when I got attitude from my waitress when I finally saw her to ask. She looks at me and says, \"I was going this way to get his water ('he' didn't ask her a question, 'I' did) and I'm going the other way to get you tea.\"\n\nOk dear, well maybe if you'd checked on us previously you wouldn't be so upset, now would you? \n\nBut above all of this, plantains, though good, are never on a chicken taco and then passed off as \"Mexican\" food. They're good tacos. And that's ok. But poor service is not.",

It wasn't just me though the salmon, bananas foster, and shrimp and grits that my friends ordered all arrived warm.

I didn't complain because I don't really do that, but some of my friends did and were told that's how he noodles were supposed to taste. When two in my group tried to order something else, the waitress (who was so sweet) had to come back and tell one of them that the chef didn't want to make what she ordered (an item that was on the menu) because he was pushing a different combination of fish. That was ridiculous. \n\nOverall my impression was that the wait staff is great, but whoever the chef is gets a 0 star review from me. \n\nI've heard the Tampa location is way better, so I'd just go there.",

    "text": "Overview: 5/10 atmosphere, 3/10 service, 7/10 food\n\nI've come here a couple times at off-dinner times (first around 5:00 pm, second time around 8:00 pm) on weekdays. Average looking storefront with the choice of table seating or sushi bar seating. The tables a bit cramped, especially the two person tables, and it isn't a particularly group friendly place. The room is crowded and smaller tables are uncomfortably close to each other. \n\nSeems like a family business, or at least I hope it is because a few of the waitstaff are downright rude. Every single thing you ask them for--be it water, chopsticks, extra ginger for gods sake--is a huge favor they're imparting to you. Don't even bother waiting for your server to take your food and drink order; call them over unless you want to be there for a couple hours or more, since the food also takes a while to prepare. This would be one thing if it was the best sushi in town, but it most certainly is not. Fish is fresh, but it is at pretty much any other mid-priced sushi restaurant in a 7 mile radius due to the town's location. Both times I've come neither toro nor uni we're on the menu...we're in Santa Barbara! Uni is shipped internationally from this city, you'd think a local restaurant could manage to have some on hand. Their specialty rolls are heavily covered in baked mayonnaise and overly battered and fried. So, go simple the next time, I thought. I ordered a spicy scallop roll, a salmon skin roll, and soft shell crab to split. Spicy scallop roll again had too much mayonnaise, though it was wrapped very well, and the soft shell crab was heavily tempura battered so much that there was more batter than crab. They were out of salmon skin, which would have been OK if they'd told me from the get-go. Instead, they brought my other food out and said they were out of salmon skin. Great, now if I order another dish it will come out later. \n\nInstead, I'll finish my food and come back never.",

    "text": "This was my first time at Cheddar's, and it was not a very good impression. Decor was really nice and we got seated very quickly by the hostess, who looked to be all of 14. Our waitress arrived and that's when it went downhill. Maybe she was new, IDK, but it took her 3 trips to our table before she was ready to take our order. I asked for a beer to be brought with the meal and not beforehand and she assured me that was not a problem. I was wanting a burger but was told sides were extra, so I went with catfish instead. Wanted a kids meal for my grandson and was informed sides for those were extra as well. What next; extra for silverware? There were no crayons or colouring books for kids to keep them busy or child sized utensils either. Anyways, the food came quick and was tasty. Portion size was very good as well. The waitress came back to check on us after about 10 minutes, at which time my wife was able to inform her that the dressing for her salad, which was supposed to be on the side, was non-existent. About 7 minutes later she came back with the oil and vinegar. We were able to finish our meal and then wait another 10 minutes or so for her to ask if we were ready for our check. During that time we we able to watch as one of the male staff came up to the hostess station and was able to give long, lingering full body hugs to the 14yo and 4 others who had gathered at the front door. When he left, the girls continued the hug fest, in between customers coming in. Such love amongst the staff! 8 minutes later the check arrived, but not before 2 other tables had to go up to hug central and ask for their server, too. Going over the bill, at least I didn't get charged for the beer that is still in their tap! Overall, I feel this place is overrated, and it'll probably be quite awhile before I go there again. By the way, if you've happened to live a long life or have served our county, they don't care. Neither senior not military discounts are offered. Bottom line; food was a hit, service was $h!+!",

    "text": "You must be from St. Louis if you are actually impressed by this place in any way.  People think the wait is long because the pizza is so good.  That's not it at all.  Actually, the bar/restaurant has an operations problem.  The kicthen is inadequate to handle the type of pizza (thick crust) they serve.  So, you wait forever.  That's forgivable.  But what isnt?  The fact that the pizza is average at best, probably below average for deep dish.  Go to Chicago, or anywhere they have quality deep dish and you will find much, much better pizza.  In addition to all that, you basically have to serve yourself (i.e. go to the bar every time you need something).  On top of that, the place is a dump.  I'm not talking about a \"dive\"...I'm talking about a \"dump\".  They do have games to play while you wait, so I guess that is good.  Anyway, don't believe the hype on this one.  Do it once to mark it off your list and move on. :)",

While I can't say it ever got truly busy, I can say that she never checked back with us after the initial \"How's everything?\" never asked us if we wanted more water. After we were clearly finished with our food, she never came back to see if we needed boxes. \n\nAt this point 2 more groups came in, one group of 4 and one group of 5 and they sat at the back of the place, those seemed to take up her time. This was about 6:30. My friend and I were done by now, we were looking at our watches, commenting that it was relatively early. By 7pm, though we were still talking, the waitress still hadn't checked on us, when we would try to get her attention, she never did seem to make eye contact with us, she simply ghosted to the back areas of the eatery. \n\nAt 7:15 we had to verbally signal her to get us boxes, and to ask for the check. She then didn't remember them for another spate of time, we finally got out of the establishment at 7:44.  The times are known because I made note.

(I was vomiting pretty bad about 5 hours after the meal, and my boyfriend didn't vomit but he had a very upset stomach and dry heaved for a bit). We think it may have been the calamari or the sauce perhaps (was the only thing we shared besides the dessert).\n\nLocation: easy to get to, connected to the Hotel Palomar, nice area\n\nAmbiance: very nice, servers are attentive, there's a nice bar area, good lighting\n\nFood:\nWine: your average wine, a little steep for the quality you get however\n\nAppetizer: we had the fried calamari, which were OK, the sauce was good, I liked the fried jalapeno slices that were in the dish. Quite a bit of the pieces were actually just fried breading and not the calamari itself. Pretty good appetizer portion for 2 - 3 people, I would think\n\nBread basket:\nwarm and tasty! a good combination of different breads. Enjoyed it very much!\n\nEntrees:\nI had the vegetarian option, which was the summer cavatelli, a pasta dish. It was tasty, a bit heavy on the balsamic vinegar. I did like the tomatoes and the nice mushrooms that were in it. The pasta was a bit too al dente, but still pretty good\n\nMy boyfriend had the duck entree. He said the duck meat was tasty, but the amount was very small. Also, he was a bit put off with the combination of tastes (duck was on top of an egg-omlette thing, and next to it was a potato thing. He really enjoyed the potato, and I tried that and it was quite good. It was like scalloped potatoes but after they cut it into slices they put it all back into a potato shape. It was pretty unique and very tasty. If you're into combination of totally different flavors, this would probably work for you\n\nDessert:\nwe had the peach/blackberry cobbler w/ ice cream, and it was superb! the cobbler was warm and delicious, the bread part was very good, and the cold ice cream complemented everything perfectly. It was also a very large cobbler! Definitely good to share. Would highly recommend\n\nOverall, the food was probably 3.5 stars, service was 4 - 4.5 stars, what knocked it down was that I got sick afterwards :-/",

    "text": "Decided to come out and try it after reading rave reviews online and am sad to say that it did not live up to it's hype at all! \n\nThe place itself is very quaint and the staff are so incredibly friendly and it really makes me wish that I'd liked the food more. Having said that, the restaurant was quite cramped and I found myself squeezed between a wall and another patron, which was not fun.\n\nOnto the food, my friend and I ordered three things to share:\n\nFresh Rolls - These come out immediately because they've been pre-prepared and are just chilling in a little glass case. I was disappointed that they didn't come with any shrimp or pork filling and they were just stuffed with bean sprouts. This is a personal thing, but I hate bean sprouts! And they cost $4! Definitely not worth it.\n\nPad Thai with Shrimp - Ah, the famous pad thai. I've been to Thailand on numerous occasions as my family lives in Malaysia currently and I've had pad thai dishes in Bangkok and Phuket a number of times so I had high expectations for this particular dish. But it really didn't deliver. It's very obviously stated on the menu that this was going to be \"authentic\" and \"not-Americanized\" but compared to actual pad thai that I've had in Thailand, this is not authentic by any means. It is quite bland and filled with bean sprouts to the point where it has me questioning the $18 price tag. Also the bean noodles are so weird texturally and they don't soak up flavor as well as rice noodles would have. The dish was just so whatever. There's no other way to describe it. It's not good but I wouldn't say it's horrible. It's just whatever. It doesn't do anything for me.\n\nGreen Curry with Chicken - This dish was again, bland and very diluted. I didn't get hit with a mouthful of intense flavor or spices or anything. It was just very milky and the rice on the side was a bit dry and clumpy. The best thing about the dish was that it was filled with beautiful, colorful, crisp vegetables. But the curry itself just wasn't as good as I'd hoped.\n\nI really don't think that I'll be coming back here again. It is so overpriced for such bland food and in my opinion, incredibly overhyped. I know Thai food quite well. I've traveled to Bangkok twice and to Phuket every year since I was 12 years old. Thai food is supposed to be flavorful and rich and spicy and this place was not any of that at all.",

    "text": "My boyfriend, my friend, and I went here late last night around midnight. We were just looking for a spot to have a nightcap and talk. This place was perfect for that. There were a lot I people at the bar but no one in the seating areas so we sat off to the side near a window looking out onto 116th Street.  That's when the trouble began. Our waitress, Amanda, was rude and seemed to be bothered by our very existence. She never really greeted us, just put menus down and asked what we wanted. We ordered a round of shots which took 10 minutes for her to bring. We ordered beers and my friend asked for an orange slice with hers. It took at least 15 minutes for her to bring the beers and she tells my friend, \"We're out of oranges for the night.\" No apology, etc. She then comes by about 12:45 to tell u the kitchen is closing and to take our menus. She doesn't ask if we need anything...her entire attitude was off putting. She doesn't come back by until 10 after 1 when she tells us that it's last call. I asked what time they closed because the website says 3 and that's what had brought us there. She stated that there's not a set closing time. Weird, but ok. She brought the check out immediately and sort of hovered and stares at us until we paid it. She then takes the cash and goes outside to smoke before bringing the change. She walked by and just laid the change on the table without saying anything. \n\nIm not sure if Amanda didn't care for us because we didn't sit at the bar or if it was because my friend was black or if she just hates customers in general. I've never felt more unwelcome in an establishment.\n\nMy boyfriend did talk to the bartender who was apologetic and gave him a free shot. My suggestion is to sit at the bar and avoid the waitress. Stick to beer as they have a great tap list reasonably priced but the liquor is a bit pricey. The shots of Petron Silver we had were $9.50 each.",

    "text": "When it comes to eating out, there's responsibility on both sides of the menu. For the restaurant, it is their responsibility to provide good service, a good environment, and of course, good food. For the dinner-goer, he or she must make their own judgment calls about what to order and why. I had it on good authority that these were some of the best margaritas in the city. I came ready to get my drank on. \n\nI made a mistake, though. I ordered a frozen margarita, which I later learned is made in a standard blender. It was the most bland margarita I've ever ordered. When you order it regular, non-frozen, you got 2-3 margarita's worth, in a big tumbler they leave at your table. Mine came in a small glass, with less alcohol and less drink than everyone around me. \n\nI'll be the first to admit: I made a giant mistake. However, I asked our waitress not once, but twice, if their frozen margaritas were good. She assured me they were delicious, but said it distractedly as she was saying something to another waiter, or as she was checking on another table. It was a busy Friday night, and I understand that she was covering a large section of the restaurant. Still, I wish that she had told me upfront how disappointing the frozen margs were: large chucks of ice not blended, watery. I felt like real sassy about it. \n\nThe nachos we ordered were good, but sloppily made. Now, maybe I've been spoiled by El Vez and their black bean nachos, but for the price, they could have been made with a little more attention - and toppings, for that matter. I'll shoulder some of the responsibility with our poor experience at Copabanana, but I wish our waitress had taken more time to point us in the right direction. Also, if what I'm told about their regular margs is true then why does Copabanana even offer this unblended, icy chunk of disappointment?",

    "text": "I went here yesterday on a recommendation from one of our staff who is a big foodie.  I thought if he loves the place then it has to be good.  Granted, we did go at an off time 3PM which is between lunch and dinner so what I have to report may be influenced by not being on their regular meal schedule and their prep may not be as good at this time.\n\nThe ambiance is not anything wowing, but it is clean and bright with photos from Greece on the wall depicting what most Americans think of when they think of Greece, very old buildings that were built to last the test of time.\n\nMy meal was just so-so.  I wouldn't say it was bad, just that it lacked the flare I was expecting.  The stewed veggies were delicious.  The chicken, rice, and hummus were average.  The gyro meat my partner ordered looked a bit dark and oily, which may be because it hadn't been ordered in a while and he was getting the outer part of the meat that cooks on the skewer.\n\nThe service is what made me give them a 2 star instead of a 3.  Our server was a young guy.  It was difficult to hear what he was saying because he ran words together and mumbled.  This guy might have been Greek, but I'm pretty sure he was at least 3rd generation American.  We had to repeat what we were reading directly off the menu several times for him to get it.  We both ordered drinks, neither of which showed before or during the meal.  I would have brought this up, but we had water and the ordering was so poor I didn't want to have the interaction again.  \n\nNow the dessert, that's another story...the baklava was amazing, good sized portion, and the honey on top was sublime.  We also got the peach gelato which comes in a frozen peach.  It was also delicious.  After the first bite, my eyes widened as I looked at my partner with excitement.  I would definitely go there again, just for dessert after eating somewhere else in that Fairmount area.  The service did get better for dessert as a woman took charge of our table, which leads me to believe it was the end of the guy's shift.  She did notice that my partner had ordered a coffee later and asked if he wanted it with dessert.  I did not see the first guy anytime after dessert and he probably left.\n\nFinally, hours later, both my partner and I had higher stomach acid issues, not severe, but enough to make me not want to return for a full meal.  My suggestion to the owners would be to watch those in-between times and give a little more effort/direction to serving/kitchen staff since there is more time without the traffic.",

The food is nowhere near as good as some other options in town (Athens, Blue Fig or even Fattoush Cafe) and the service I've received has always been sub-par.\n\nWhen I first went to Kalamata's I was surprised at how it worked. You go in, order at a counter and then get your own plastic silverware and napkins and pick a seat. The food is served on styrofoam plates and your drinks are served in styrofoam. This seems like laziness on the restaurant's part. There are no real waiters to speak of so if something is wrong, you have to take it back to the counter--where I've had to wait in line just to get a wrong order fixed.\n\nThe food itself is okay. I'm not blown away by anything I've had on their menu. A couple of times I've ordered the hummus with pita bread, which is a big mistake. The hummus tastes about as fresh as the Athenos stuff in the supermarket and the pita bread is served cold. Why? It takes so little time to heat up pita bread. Yet another problem that just seems like laziness on the restaurant's part.\n\nUltimately,  my biggest problem with Kalamata's is the fact that I can get the same meal on plates with real silverware and receive actual service at a couple other restaurants in Nashville for the same price. I think that for my dollar here I should have gotten a lot more than I did.",

No more sudden realizations that I'm in Rivergate or Cool Springs and should take advantage of a Chick-Fil-A. I could go any time!\n\nBut. What. The. Hell.\n\nApparently Nashvillians don't know how to use a double lane drive through.\n\nAnd may I ask why the drive thru goes around the front of the restaurant instead of the back of the restaurant like every other damn fast food restaurant?\n\nThough, kudos for the free WiFi that I can use on my phone while I'm waiting twenty minutes in line at the drive thru.\n\nSo I avoid this place like the plague. I'll wait til next time I'm in Rivergate or Cool Springs for some amazing waffle fries.",

    "text": "My first time trying Indian. I would say my neutral rating is due to the service. The waitress didn't introduce herself or any specials and didn't  explain the menu it was just a \"what do you want.\" We guessed and picked a few things, they were good. Then when the bill came she put it on the table and in under a minute came back and picked it up before we even looked at it. Waitress then said \"how are you paying\" I felt awkward because we hadn't pick it up and it was a first date and she put the bill in front of me. I was hoping my date would be chivalrous, and he was but it was uncomfortable with the waitress coming back picking it up and seeing we didn't put a card in the book yet , because we weren't ready and she kept putting the bill back down, in front of me! This happened about three times. In my prior service experience you put the check in the middle, not in front of one person especially the lady of a date. Unsure if I'll go back.",

We stopped ordering from them because they always seemed to mess up something in the order. Today we decided to give it another shot. I ordered the Brettman burger which is an 11$ burger but which sounded amazing!  I ordered it medium well which I thought was a pretty safe request. I received it RARE. When you spend that much on a burger you would at least expect it to be cooked as ordered. I think we're done with this place - at least for lunch.",

We got them to preorder a dish for us as we were going to be 15 mins late.  Upon arriving the restaurant was mid packed.  We went downstairs and ordered drinks and food after a 30 min wait cause the server was busy.  Well fast forward 2 hours later, not even exaggerating...the time was 9:25 when we got our first dish we pre ordered in the car on the way to the restaurant.  The server was very apologetic.  We were very antsy at this point and upset.  \nThe platter was scarce but food was good, our prawns were stone cold.  Not worth the extra cost as the portions were tiny.  The server took off an appetizer from the bill and offered free dessert for the wait.  Well we were starving at this point so we walked to Old Spagetti Factory and enjoyed  a quick good meal.\n\nTo sum up...2 hrs wait for food, cold prawns, tiny portion size vs cost and starving.  Our meal still cost us $30 per person.\n\nWe won't be back and our group was so unimpressed they swore this place off too.  Very disappointed.",

My complaints lie more with their administrative faults and the 500 taxes they add to your bill:\nWhen I made my initial reservation, they took $300 from my account, but I understood what that was for. However, when I checked in, they charged me for both nights because the $300 I had already deposited had not \"appeared on the system.\" They finally found the glitch and said they'd give the money back at checkout (which they have yet to do), and $300 is some good spending money, especially at this resort. \nWhen it came to checkout, they apply a $18/night resort fee, so...WHY is this NOT applied to the room rate in the first place?!? So if you're looking at prices, add that, plus parking ($20 self park, $28 valet A NIGHT!). Then add the additional SIX taxes per night, that average around $15 per tax. You do the math, and add that to the room rate that is advertised before deciding on an extended stay. Honestly would've been better off in a downtown hotel overlooking the city.",

The gentlemen ordered ck tortilla soup and the presentation was awesome but the broth was cold.  No one ever checked after dropping off food.  You would have thought that picking up bowls with all the chips and the butter still in the bowl the server might have asked if things were alright. Our steaks arrived rather slowly and mine, ordered m/r was so rare it was cold in the center.  We had to flag the waitress to send it back.  A man in a sport coat returned it to the table but not a word was said, he laid it on the table and took off.(now it's medium--we'll show you)  I assume he was some sort of manager there were several men with jackets on walking around. If you are going to have food runners serving the tables then someone should shortly be behind to see if things are prepared properly or if anything is needed.  We asked for water 3 different times.  If you are looking for a quiet spot to dine, have good food, and chat this place is not for you.  Very loud . So for $235 dollars for 3 I can go elsewhere for an exceptional dinner.",

We were sitting for 25 minutes before the waiter came to get drink orders. I had to ask the hostess to light a fire under him. Not that the young man wasn't nice. He just was poorly trained and slow. Looking around it seemed as if all the servers were away from the tables and out of the dining room most of the time. Back in the kitchen perhaps? Certainly not attending to our needs. At this price point I expect more and have gotten better service almost anywhere else in Philly. \nThe food was just OK. My husband and I had the prime rib. I've had it elsewhere in Philly for a lot less and it's been comparable flavor wise. My friend had salmon which, again, was OK. The sides were OK. Nothing special. When it came time for coffee it was not presented with cream or sugar and when the sugar came, there was no teaspoon with which to stir it into the coffee. Don't know what the rave reviews are all about because we won't be back.",

Service was extremely slow and short. It seemed like customers were bothersome to the employees. The beans were soggy and water-downed. The food had next-to-nothing flavor. One reviewer here is probably right in that it's probably microwaved. They use a clear and visible part of the restaurant as literally a storage closet. I don't know they do this, but they leave the bathroom doors open and you can have a view of the urinal and people doing their business in the men's bathroom. They don't know how to separate/split a check (see the photo for how they did it). \n\nYou can see in my other reviews of the great options for Mexican food in South Tucson. Do not come to or expect authentic food at El Dorado. Avoid it.",

The hotel was sold out, which is awesome for them!\n\nThe analogy I'd use for this lodging experience is this: it's like when you meet a really ripped gorgeous dude, and you start talking with him, and there's really no personality there, but he's easy on the eyes, so you stick around to see the rest. When you finally get to the moment where his pants come off, and the lip balm in your purse is bigger than what he's packing, so the whole experience is just disappointing.\n\nThe place is visually stunning! It's an eternal climate controlled springtime full of gardens and rivers and waterfalls under an expansive glass ceiling! That's about all that's impressive about this place.\n\nThe food service is woefully understaffed and most of the many restaurants are closed most of the day. There are long lines and long waits for everything, and when you get a seat, the service is slow and the food quality ranges from terrible to mediocre and is definitely not worth the prices, and I'm someone who will shell out for quality and not think twice about it.\n\nThe linens are no better than you'd expect in a budget motel. Towels, sheets and blankets are clean but thin and scratchy. The beds are comfortable.\n\nThe room could have been cleaned more thoroughly. It wasn't obviously dirty, but finding a pair of socks left by a previous occupant hiding under the curtains didn't inspire my confidence in the housekeeping.\n\nThe location is far from everything, so it's a hike to try to get to other options for food, etcetera, so you're stuck with hour long waits for a cup of coffee or a frozen McDonald's quality burger and paying $6 for a box of 10 tampons in the gift shop.",

Especially Thomas in the meat section.  For these two things I would give them a five.  However, it does downhill from this point on:  ordered one pound of swiss cheese, after standing there waiting for about 5 minutes, and no one else was on line, the unfriendly clerk waited on us. The imported swiss cheese that we ordered was so poorly cut that in two days we had one clump of swiss cheese, rather than many slices.  I bought ricotta cheese for Easter and went to open it, and it was bad, although it was dated 3/28.  The tomatoes on the vine that I bought on Friday were bad by Sunday.  I have found their prices very high, selection, poor and at this point it is just not worth it. I also bought two pound cakes and their were not up to par.  Very dry and tasteless.. Overall a very disappointing shopping trip \nThere is plenty of convenient parking and the store was immaculate, but it is not for me.  The final straw was that I asked for extra cash for Easter gifts, the clerk at the register said there was a $150 limit, the ATM terminal said $100 and the \"manager\" said $50...I thought they should get their act together.  Best to stay with Weaver's Way... or Whole Foods or Wegmann's.",

    "text": "After a bad storm temporarily shut down our new-to-us favorite coffee shop Pagoda, I decided to give this spot a try.  Won't be back.  Here's why...\n\nLocation:\nLook, parking in town can be difficult.  That is no different here.  I found a spot nearby but I've talked to others that had to walk quite a ways to get here.  Just luck of the draw.  Beautiful gardens and homes to look at (duh) so just enjoy the stroll.  I'm not applying this towards my overall scoring but I'm noting it so you know that I know that you know what the deal-i-o is.\n\nAtmosphere:\nDead silent.  Seriously.  So.  Freaking.  Quiet.  If you need to study then you've found a winner!  If you want coffee and a chat then you need to move it outside or to another spot.\n\nWhen I walked in everyone looked and stared not because they cared about checking out my style or anything but because I made an actual loud noise and it startled them.\n\nNot the largest coffee shop but seating inside for probably 30 at max capacity?  Chairs and tables not the comfiest nor the biggest. \n\nAfter I got my coffee from the huffy barista (more on that in the next section because I should really review the product & service I got) I chose a spot to read my new cookbook and just tried to enjoy the stillness.  That was great until the guy behind the counter started a very loud and very angry and very loooooong conversation with someone on his cell phone.  In a space that had up until that moment been as quiet as a church, his voice seemed like it was coming out of a loudspeaker.  Look, I'm nosy but I try to make it look like I'm not obviously nosy but it wouldn't have mattered here.  This guy really got into it and wouldn't have noticed if the roof fell in.  He certainly didn't notice the customers standing at the counter waiting long minutes for him to finish what was very obviously a VERY PERSONAL phone call.  After a few minutes I gave up pretending I wasn't watching and took in the show.  After ignoring the customers for a few minutes he finally ended his call, heaved numerous sighs and 'helped' them with the same care he'd given me.  Spoiler alert: it wasn't indifferent but rather seemingly downright rude.  I watched this play out with a steady stream of folks for the next 30 minutes or so and finally left because all of this was stressing me out a bit.  Not really relaxing, ya?\n\nService:\nI asked for a large coffee and was trying to decide if I wanted medium, dark or chicory when it appeared in front of me.  If you don't know what you want in the first 2 seconds then they'll just make up your mind for you.  Okkkkkkk.  I watched this happened to a few of the customers after me too.  This guy wasn't really needing to be dealing with the public because there wasn't obviously other stuff going on that made it difficult for him to his job.  Everyone has a bad day but don't take it out out on the customer to the extreme.  I mean, you don't have to kiss my butt but don't be all huffy and DO NOT PICK MY COFFEE FOR ME WITHOUT ASKING.  Rude.\n\nCoffee:\nIt was good.  Not great.  Not mind-blowing.  Good.  Not as hot as I prefer but more heat than tepid.  I ended up pouring about 1/4 out because I got some grounds in the finish.\n\nI couldn't find spoons and after waiting a moment at the counter to ask (remember, my first time here) and being ignored I just used a straw.  I hate to drink fair-trade coffee that wasn't my choice poured by an angry barista and then throw away plastic when I don't have to.\n\nOther:\nI didn't eat so no word on that.\n\nBathrooms were clean enough.\n\nGreat restaurants nearby.\n\nI really should give the spot 1 star but the cleanliness of the main room, the overall neighborhood area and the outdoor seating bumps it up a notch.  Just know your fair trade coffee can be served with a buttload of snark.",

It's a combination of industrial and a beach feel. I loved the appearance of the bar and all of the decorative touches down to the painting of the rest room doors. I loved the different shades of woods used paired with shades of blues and white. It was very spacious and open and the place is much larger then I initially realized. Unfortunately the decor was the best thing about this location.\n\nWe started off with a margarita pizza. There was an excessive amount of flour on the dough. Enough that all 6 of us noticed and tasted it. Our waiter was friendly but unable to make any suggestions about the menu when asked. The servers that brought the food were unpleasant and  just did a drop and run. \n\nI ordered the  huevous ranchos. It was presented in a beautiful manner. There was a strong taste of citrus which I am not a fan of. I was unable to eat the dish and sent it back. Two people ordered shrimp and grits. The grits had no seasoning, had no taste of butter and had a lumpy consistency that we all disliked. Someone ordered the mango chutney grilled cheese. It looked fantastic but his response was that it was blah. We had a child with us who ordered silver dollar pancakes. Instead of smaller kid friendly pancakes 3 larger pancakes were served. Two people ordered the yogurt parfait. It said it was layered with strawberry compote but instead it was fresh strawberries, blueberries and a sprinkling of granola. The oddest food preparation to me was the side of scrapple someone ordered. It came deep fried. I'm a scrapple connoisseur. I have never seen scrapple served like this. It should be on the menu if it isn't going to be prepared as it usually is. It was very crispy but way to greasy and made this scrapple lover pass it onto the next person to try.\n\nI loved the decor of this place enough that I might give it another try. Maybe it was an off day. I certainly hope so because this is a place that has so much potential!",

    "text": "Just got home from blue plate after hoping for a redemption from my last bad experience. I went a few months ago and had the breakfast poutine. As I was eating I found a HUGE piece of Brillo pad in my food. I was annoyed because I truly enjoyed the 3 fries I did eat. They take my food and my mom gives me half of her BLT. As I go to take a bite I notice there's MOLD all over the roll. Unfortunately, she has already eaten the other half of her sandwich. They let us go without being charged for drinks. \nTonight I tried again for dinner and it was a fail. I got the gnocchi's with sherry and tomatoes and it was terrible. Barely any sauce that looked more like a glaze. The gnocchi's were hard and bland. I literally had about 6 gnocchi's and was hoping maybe the waitress or hostess would ask if my food was okay but they didn't. My food looked like it wasn't touched!! It's my own fault for not speaking up but Ive never returned food because I just didn't like it... even though this was on another level of bad. I payed $18 for a meal I did not eat. I think unfortunately I'm done with blue plate.",

    "text": "Overpriced and commercialized are two words that come to mind. I was going between 2 or 3 stars and just couldn't go higher.  Sorry wish I could go 3-4 stars, but they are lacking for the reasons we go to a farm.\n\nThe bad:\nMost of their products are not made on the farm and imported from other areas.  That alone makes me want to give it 1 star.  The apple cider doughnuts are decent, but other farms close by will offer them hot and fresh out of the oven. They make them early in the morning and throw them on the shelf.  Overall prices are pretty expensive.  \n\n\nThe good:\nThey have a \"fair like\" atmosphere that is fun for kids.  I don't know of many other places that offer this.  If you want to go just for this you will have a good time.  We have gone picking for various vegetables and that was fun - again it feels a little commercialized but we had a good time.  It's located in a decent spot and parking is convienent.",

    "text": "My hubby and I decided, on a whim, to visit, since we saw some decent ratings. We arrived just after 1pm. It was packed with people: families, couples, teenagers. \n\nWe walked up to the counter and ordered a Greek Quesadilla and a New Orleans Quesadilla with a coke to share. It came to $18. \n\nAs I walked into the dining area, I like led the simple ambiance. Not many tables available; and, the open tables were not clean. Red flag for me.  I cleaned our table of choice and held back my opinion about it. Later our order taker cleaned off the rest of the tables, and did a mediocre job of sweeping the floors. Not bad, but enough to make you ask yourself how well they manage their crew. \n\nOkay, on with the food. They called out our order and the Quesadillas came out piping hot. We had to wait a few minutes to eat them. Each 12\" Quesadilla was served on a tray lined with foil. A handful of lettuce graced the presence of the correlating international sauce (eg. Italian, Greek, Mexican), served in a small cup.  Tzatkiki, for example, with the Greek. \n\nI opened the Greek and it was steaming hot with gooey cheese, black olives, and banana pepper. I added lettuce for more depth. The flavors were mild, but tasty. Nothing that really wowed me or that I could not make at home.  I ate half and took the rest home. \nThe New Orleans style was made with blackened chicken, red pepper and bacon nestled in melted cheese (of which he could not recall). He said he liked it. That was all. He fussed more over the cookie than he did over the Quesadilla. The cookies looked amazingly tasty. \n\nWe agreed that, while this place was okay, it would not make our list of frequented establishments.",

The place did not seem that busy as far as restaurants go, so maybe they're not used to the traffic. \n\nThe salad was not worth $15. If I hadn't gotten it with chicken I would have been sorely disappointed, though it was sad even with the $5 chicken finger on it. \n\nThe food is cooked in the restaurant, but the server has to walk out of the restaurant and across the hall to the bar to get your drinks (at least alcoholic ones). The same goes for the bar: the food comes from the restaurant across the hall.",

Tryst did not want to take any responsibility for the fact that her meal was ruined and provided no discount to her meal or gift card to come back. I am sure they lost a patron for good.

The hostess was less than excited to greet us with barely a smile and such a low voice we could hardly understand her.  After we sat, it took our server about 10 minutes to greet us, although he was apologetic and cheery.  It then took another 6-7 mins to bring our drinks, one beer and water.  The good was far below par.  My jalepeno shooters were luke warm at best.  My half pound burger was average and her special sirloin lacked any seasoning.  All I can say is that I'm glad we had a gift card from Christmas we used because I would've asked to speak to a manager...which I didn't notice one at all patrolling the floor.  Maybe in the future we will try again but most likely at a different location!!",

Though we were greeted immediately and our table for 8 was ready, we opted to grab a drink at the bar as we were early and the first to arrive. The BF was excited to try one of their ice cream martinis, though I don't remember his choice and I ordered the \"le fleur-\" a champagne cocktail with St. Germain and hibiscus. The girl who took our drinks then proceeded to make some dessert so I assumed she told one of the other 37 people behind the bar to make them. Well mine was made and left at the server drink station for some server to stare at while she was eating a salad and working, at the bar. After about 8 minutes we got both drinks. My bf's was more like a chocolate martini, literally no ice cream. And mine was so syrupy (if that's a word) I could barely fast the champagne or St. Germain. We finally sat down and our server was great, she greeted everyone, brought waters, went over the specials. The vegetarian Cuban soup was amazing!! I ordered the chicken salad sandwich with the dressing on the side and my BF got the Thursday special-short rib ravioli. Mine came out with the dressing and his was cold. Our server did take it off but she also never checked on any of us, so my BF sat there without eating for about 20 minutes. I may give it another try, but not likely.",

Free peanuts is great, large mugs of beer is really nice, and it's a hat trick when you're not seated around wailing children.  Standard chain restaurant: mediocre but acceptable starters and entrees; middle shelf beer and wine choices; cocktail offerings that make you think a fruit juice factory exploded; and staff who can barely give enough of a damn to pay attention.\n\nHere's my real complaint.  I ordered a ribeye, rare.  I got a thin slice of steak that was just gray enough on the outside to qualify as done and probably medium rare if you turn the lights down.  I pointed out to the server that there was no color to the outside of the steak, and he explains to me that you can't cook a steak that thin rare and get color on it.  First, yes.  You can.  Second, don't lecture me on how a steak is prepared.  Your job is to bring it to me.  Third, if the people in the back can't cook a steak to proper doneness without cooking it well, that's OK, but don't call yourself TEXAS Roadhouse.  Texans know how to cook meat.  This place knows how to warm it.\n\nGo if you're hungry and it's the quickest place to sit down.  Be sure you get you money's worth by eating at least 3 pounds of peanuts.",

    "text": "The only reason I am giving this place 2 stars is because of the HOSTESS!  Now, I go to a lot of restaurants. The hostess (petite black girl) is extremely rude with an attitude. As soon as we walked through the doors, she looked at us and said the wait would be 30mins (which wasn't the case because she sat another couple down 5 min after us). Someone needs to fire her! She brought our menus over and just put them on the table, rolled her eyes and walked away. No smile, nothing. What a horrible start of our meal. Then the same thing happened to the couple who sat next to us where the couple said thank you for bringing the menus and she walked away without saying anything or smiling! \n\nThe bartenders and waiters are attentive and nice. \nThe burger here is wonderful! It's big, juicy and full of flavor. 5 stars for a delicious burger!",

    "text": "Have you ever gone to a restaurant, place your order and wonder whether or not what you just did was a good idea? Well, it happened to me at this place. Actually, it was after I used the restroom that I became concerned and questioned my decision.\n\nBefore I go further I should explain I (obviously) survived to tell the tale. :)\n\nSee, this used to be a Church's Fried Chicken restaurant. Therefore you can expect it to be a little run down. However, it appears they kept the old greasy everything for posterity. The walls and floors are covered in grease. There's grease on the plumbing at the urinal for the love of all that's holy. My guess is they moved in and didn't even clean the place.  How it passes inspection is beyond me. As they say, if you want to know how clean a restaurant is look at the bathroom. \n\nThe people were very nice.  I showed up about 20 minutes before closing and ordered food to go. I learned something in that they premake their fried rice. I suppose they add the meat or whatever to it as they go, but they were all out so I had to go with white rice. Of course, it was bland as you'd expect.\n\nI ordered sesame chicken but there was hardly any sauce and no sesame.  So, it was deep fried chicken nuggets with a little sauce. The portion was large so you get a fair amount at a decent price. The flavor of the sauce was OK but the meat itself is questionable. Every restaurant buys breaded nuggets so this place isn't unique. The chicken, though, didn't seem right. It was cooked thoroughly but seemed off like it was perhaps pressed something or the other. \n\nThe crab Rangoon that came with it was inedible. They tasted of old grease, we're dry as a bone and definitely not a good choice. Maybe it's because it was the end of the night, I don't know. But they were horrible. Sorry folks. Skip these mm if you go here.\n\nPerhaps my experience was an anomaly. Others seem to enjoy it. Maybe I've become spoiled or expect too much. I don't think so. A clean restaurant is expected at any cost. This place doesn't even come close. \n\nDon't take my word on it. Try for yourself. Who knows, it could be the best experience you've had.",

    "text": "I decided to give this place a try though my go to\npizza place is Angelos on Larchmont. Well, the delivery was prompt and everything was hot thus the two stars. I ordered the chicken cutlet sandwich on a seeded roll but asked for saut\u00e9ed spinach instead of broccoli rabe, which they gave me. Unfortunately, the saut\u00e9ed spinach had no taste and I didn't taste any sharp provolone cheese either (you would have surely tasted it). I had to add garlic powder, red pepper flakes and grated parm cheese so it had some taste. The seeded roll was the winner. As a result of the good reviews of the rice balls I decided to order them. Gross - right in the trash. To all of the New Yorkers who ate here and said it was as good as New York Italian food doesn't know good food from mediocre food. Back to Angelos. Best food around!",

Worth walking to Dunkin for coffee. However if you order anything but coffee be aware. I often get the wrong items, wrong quantity or even don't get things. Today was particularly bad. It's Mother's Day and it seems they have been stockpiling the items because the muffins were sooooo dry. As in they crumbled just getting the wrapper off the bottom. It was like eating croutons that were muffin flavor. Very dissatisfied. Coffee was good as always so whatever. Good stinks but coffee is close to where I drop of car so most likely I'll be back.

    "text": "I'm leaving a review because the Delbert service at this place was terrible. I ordered some delivery with my roommate on a Sunday night from this place. After over an hour went by, we still hadn't gotten our food. When I called back, the guy on the phone said the driver delivered our food to the wrong house but was on the way. When he got there about ten minutes later, the food obviously wasn't very warm. I will admit, my falafel wrap and salad were fresh and pretty good, but I obviously would have preferred it warmer. When the driver dropped the food off, I mentioned that I ordered a smoothie that wasn't with my order. He said he would go back and get it then come back. After 20 mins, I had a feeling he wouldn't be coming back. I called back the store, but they must have been closed. Lou, the man on the phone, actually called me back and told me the driver went to his other job. He was courteous enough to provide me with two free smoothies the next day, so I appreciated that. But I wasn't happy the driver decided to just go to his other job. Overall, the food was good, and Lou was very nice on the phone and professional. But I suggest he find another driver so he doesn't alienate other customers who may order delivery in the future.",

    "text": "Came here for Labor Day brunch with my boyfriend, and this place was not as busy so we were able to seat ourselves right away. However, service was absolutely terrible. We had to go up to the bar multiple times and talk to at least 3 different servers to even get waters. After putting our drinks in at the bar with the intoxicated bartender/manager, we had to wait another 20 minutes to receive these drinks and ask another couple of servers about the status of our drinks. The staff was less than apologetic about our wait, which frustrated us even more. After a while, I believe a bus-boy took our order and finally gave us our drinks. We ordered mimosas and coffee which were pretty good and decently sized. After the bus-boy took our order for the Piazza Omelette and the Breakfast Calzone, we received our food in about 30 minutes. The woman that ended up helping us said that she was a volunteer for the outdoor bar and didn't actually work at Cafe Piazza (ridiculous). Our food was a 7/10 with good sized portions and flavor. However, overall I was astounded how awful the service was. The only reason I give this place 2 stars instead of 1 is because the food and drinks were good. But that was also screwed up by the time and manner we received them. If your staff can't handle a half full restaurant, hire more servers or go through extensive training because this was the worst service I have ever received in my life.",

Me and some friends were hungry so we headed here tonight me and another friend wanted to split a plain upside down pizza. I kid you not they must have cooked the bread and cheese in the oven then dumped sauce on it after. When it was brought to the table the lake of sauce was steaming but was not hot or bubbling which gave me the impression it was added after. Please look at my picture and you will see this massive abundance of sauce just pouring off the pizza after removing a slice. It was a mess.

This restaurant is staffed by a very young, inexperienced and unprofessional staff, probably due to the steady flow of lunchtime traffic from the several larger companies in the immediate area.   Don't get me wrong; if the food were a five, I'd sit on the floor - but the kitchen is a far cry from that. \n\nThere is far better in the immediate area, for about the same money.",

The manager told me that I could go to the bar because they had a limited menu there. So, I went to the bar top where I was ignored for about 5 minutes, the 2 bartenders didn't even make eye contact with me or even let me know that they would be with me in a minute. There was only 4 other people at the bar at the time. I was going to order the BBQ shrimp because I have heard rave reviews about them, but when I asked if they de-vein the shrimp the bartender told me know. Well, as I have mentioned before, this is really culinary 101 here folks, how many times have you heard a chef like Gordon Ramsay or Bobby Flay etc. tell people to de-vein those things because no one wants to eat their poop tract!! The bartender asked me if I liked crab cakes and I smiled and told hime that I loved them and that I was a bit of a connoisseur about them. Well, he told me that they had the best in town and that I wouldn't be disappointed. Well, he couldn't have been more wrong! Although they had a good amount of crab in them, they were one note and quite tasteless, I was really disappointed to say the least. I walked all that way for nothing.......guess maybe I might go back and try something else on the menu, I don't know yet.",

The portion was small for the price, and it looked as though it had been prepared earlier, perhaps wrapped in plastic wrap, and then unwrapped to be served...everything was sort of smashed together on the plate.  My friends steak was ordered Medium and served Med Rare and floating in butter. The fries were lukewarm. Service was pleasant and friendly and beverages were kept full.\n\nThen we had breakfast on January 16th and 17th.  The staff were all smiling and friendly ....they seemed to want to help....but there also seemed to be a big gap in organization. On both mornings, the buffet ran out of plates and food. When the food was replenished, the portions put out were small ...even though the restaurant and the bar were packed with people. If you weren't standing at the buffet, waiting for more food to come out ....then by the time you got from your table to the buffet and waited in line ....the food was gone again.  On both mornings.....I ate my toast, scrambled eggs, and bacon at differing times because if there were eggs...there was no bacon, if there was bacon there were no eggs.....and the loaf of bread was over 30 minutes in appearing.  \n\nThere was also something else we encountered.  The tables had napkins, forks, and knifes .....but no spoons.  Coffee was offered to us on both mornings....and we asked for cream and Splenda ...which were quickly provided.  And when we said 'there are no spoons'....the waitress on each morning said 'yes, we don't roll them in the napkins anymore because people are stealing them'....so then we smiled and said ...'well can we have spoons please?' .... spoons never arrived, so we used our knives.  Now ....if you, as a waitress, know there are no spoons on the table, and you also know your customer wants cream and sweetener for their coffee.......wouldn't you bring a spoon when you deliver the cream?  \n\nIt was clean and the staff IS friendly ...they just need some good old fashioned direction.",

The broth was horrible, all water and no flavor, and they really skimped out on the portion of meat. \n\nBeing Vietnamese, I really should have known better and ordered something else, but I just couldn't resist as I heard so much good things about this place from my \"American\" friends. In short, for all my Vietnamese brothers and sisters out there, do not order the pho as it is nowhere near on the level or standards we're used too. If you come here, I recommend the bim bop, curry, or something on the vermicelli side. As for pricing, it's a place in downtown, so don't expect reasonable pricing we're used to.\n\nHowever, for all my American friends out there.....this place is great :D",

    "text": "I tend to prefer local cupcake shops to fancy chains like Sprinkles, but unfortunately I must say that I prefer Sprinkles to The Flying Cupcakes.\nFirst, visually, the frosting-to-cupcake ratio is too small.  I like eating cake with frosting.  I don't want to eat too much of cake without frosting. \nSecond, I'm not a fan of having chocolate chips in my red velvet cake.  They overwhelm the flavor of cream cheese frosting. \nThird, and this is the biggest negative, the frosting does not melt in the mouth!  It's too thick and hard, which means when you eat the cake with the frosting, they do not mash well in the mouth to give the goodness of all the flavors melted together. You might as well eat them separately. \n\nI only tried their red velvet cupcake, and maybe their other flavors are better, but I think I make better cupcakes at home, and I have certainly had much better cupcakes from other stores.  I don't think they are worth my $3 or my time waiting in line.  Their window displays are cute though!",

But I just had my first order of 2018 and they have definitely changed since last fall. The batter now has an overly pronounced cornmeal flavor and consistency and it really changes the crunch of the curd crust and overall taste. The cheese itself seemed a bit off too. There was always a mix of white and yellow cheddar curds in each order. This visit all the curds were yellow cheddar and had a \"Velveeta\" feel and taste to them, instead of the normal rich and stringy cheddar cheese.

We were super lucky and excited to find two open bar seats without having to wait an hour. \n\nWhen I asked the bar tender if the burger came with fries, he laughed and said that other restaurants only do that as \"filler food\" and that we'd have to order them on the side, they're just that good. And that the burger is so amazing that you don't need fries. We thought \"fair enough, must be good.\" \n\nWe got our burger and the fries. At best, the burger was mediocre. It was juicy and on a nice bun, but otherwise a very expensive ordinary burger. The fries were also pretty standard. There were few and they were presented nicely in a little cup, but pretty standard. \n\nWhile we were full at the end of our meal and it wasn't terrible, it was just average at best. The bartender was a bit cocky about the food which also was a big turn-off.

Both of us got the prix fixed menu, which included a salad, entree, and a dessert.  One thing that definitely rubbed me the wrong way was the fact that they charge $4 for iced tea, which is brought to you in this little glass teapot-like contraption.  And, they do not offer free refills for this!  I was a little stunned when the waitress told us this.  I was trying to think if there were any other places I had been in St.Louis that didn't offer free refills, and I couldn't think of any.  Very strange.\n\nThe caesar salad that my wife and I got was fine, and the filet I ordered was good as well, although small.  The dessert was a small portion as well, which I guess is to be expected on the prix fixed menu.

It also came with a tower of sandwiches and 2 scones for each person, out of about 6 different sandwiches on the platter there were only about 2 that were edible. The rest were absolutely horrible.

If you can find a server, that is. \n\nActually, the service isn't that bad ... the problem is with the layout of the place. The shops here want to have an eclectic air, as though they were built from driftwood and shipping crates held together with sail cloth and rope. This is fine in fantasy, but in reality does not make it easy for the wait staff to get around easily of remain within eye sight of their tables. \n\nThe food is passable, but unexceptional. Being a stone throw away from Gulf of Mexico means that a restaurant can lean towards basic tourist fare (they likely won't know how boring it is) and get away with it. Locals tend to shy away from such places, unless they are entertaining out-of-townees who believe boat drinks and breezes are more important than fine dining.",

We were out to dinner a little later than usual, so our favorite place was going to be closing soon (Ting Wong) and figured we'd give Lee How Fook a try.  We used to go here a few years ago, but now I now why we must have left.  The Peking Spare Ribs lacked flavor, the Salt Baked Squid was dry and chewy and the Chinese Broccoli was way too salty.  Food seemed fresh, just not very well prepared.  We'll try someplace else, next time we're too late for Ting Wong.",

I probably would have given it a 3.  The fries are good, but not mind-blowing as some people have described them.\n\nTonight, I read a ton of great reviews about the Philly Steak, so I was happy to try it.  Somehow, on the 3-block walk home, the sandwich became extremely soggy.  Not just regular messy-sandwich soggy, but so soggy that I couldn't actually pick it up.  I had to eat it with a fork.  The tomatoes and lettuce had already become warm, too.  The mushrooms and mock meat were pretty good, but for some odd reason, there was a ton of ketchup on everything.  It took away from the other flavors.  \n\nLastly, the prices posted on here are not updated.  The meal was over $15 (something like $9.25 for the sandwich and $4 something for the fries).\n\nI'll try it again and get another dish on the menu, but I was so sad about tonight's experience.",

The employee staffing the cash register appeared to be aloof and not interested in providing good customer service at all. Don't come to this Chipotle during the lunch rush hour unless you are willing to wait. Last week I placed a to go order on the website for my entire family. I paid for the order ahead of time. When I arrived to pick it up, I stood at the cash register for 3 minutes before being acknowledged, despite Chipotle's advertising about being able to show up and get your order right away. I was given my order bag without any thanks, and then drove the 50 minutes to home (this was to be a special treat for my wife, who likes Chipotle, although we do not have one near our home). Upon arriving home, I found that they left out both of my kids' drinks and both of my kids' sides with their meals. I called back three times before the phone was answered and the person who answered took down my name, saying she would make it right the next time I was there. How does she expect the staff to remember? Sorry, but I don't plan for there to be a next time that I visit this Chipotle, when there are several other choices on the North side for a good lunch or dinner. 2 stars rather than 1 star, because the quality of the food is great.",

I called and the gentleman that took my order answered the phone. I asked was I charged or did they just forget he told me he never heard me say my order. Which sticks but ok. But I said well why did they give me the mojo pork dipping sauce if it he didn't hear me? He said didn't hear me and is that's it.

I don't know if they have smaller pancakes there but the ones i've always got covered the plate. The check came as soon as the food as well. She seemed chatty with a table next to me but cold as ice in my direction. I generally tip really well upwards or more of the cost of the meal but she ended up with 20%.

Another couple even commented to us that they felt uncomfortable to talk in the restaurant. \nMy husbands peppercorn steak was literally all peppercorns. He ended up needing to scrape off the sauce to eat any part of the meal.

This is a common trick to make more profit for less. The tamales were filled with rice, this is not typically found in tamales.

    "text": "I had to try this place out per family recommendation and am just thankful I didn't stay here for the entire duration!  Just as the other reviewers pointed out, this Disneyland for adults makes me feel trapped inside an oversized, overpriced, pretentious playground.  What bothers me is that the staff at the various restaurants and cafes all look unhappy -- nary a smile was present -- which, to me, is not a good sign for I prefer to patronize businesses where the employees are happy.   The whole outfit seem very very commercial to me, lacking a certain warmth.  In retrospect, I notice all the talk about how grand the Opryland is seems to be because the corporation that owns it touts its own horn real well!\n\nWhile we were there, a huge sales convention for the Avaya folks were taking place and they filled all the restaurants and made the place seem too business-y for a vacation.  All the tables at the Irish pub and the sports bar was filled.   The Avaya organizers also blocked off some parts of the resort near the convention center, most importantly walkways that connect certain areas, and forced us to take long detours that were at least 5 minutes to walk around.  I really resent that.\n\nWe booked a greenhouse atrium view room, and got the Delta area.  Wish we got the Nature Conservatory  area instead -- because it is a nicer, lusher, older (hence more mature) greenhouse.  Our room look out to the spectacular greenhouse structure, but the commercialism of the hotel was too visible from the balcony. Stax, the stage for concert of the convention center, and two other cafes were visible.  I would prefer less commercialism in my face for the price I paid.  Still, the open air balcony with two quaint chair and a metal table was cute.  \n\nBeware that the sound of the various waterfalls can be really loud in the greenhouse from your room.  You may like the sound of water in the background.  I didn't mind it, though it sounded more like white noise than a pleasant burble.  \n\nOverall, I detest the commercialism present at every turn of this hotel, (the self-guided audio tour of the greenhouse costs $5! shuttle to downtown: $15!), dislike the distance I have to go to get to the car, and the large business crowd thronging the resort.   \n\nThe bed was ok, the coffee maker, which I used to boil water, was disgusting -- the water came out with an oily film.  Wif speed was ok (though it costs $15 per day as part of the mandatory resort fee).  Only ate at the Irish pub after reading Yelp reviews that said it is the best of the bunch.  The fish and chip was decent, but I found the french fries and onion rings taste a bit burn.\n\nI am happy to experience a slice of Nashville critical to its culture, though quite disappointed.\n\nCome here for the experience if you like, but also try other good hotels in Nashville!",

My husband and two kids and I came in because we used to go to the KOP location all of the time. We ordered our food, including refried beans which always came with chips at the kop spot. The beans came alone at the beginning with nothing but a spoon. I understand bringing food as it's ready...I actually appreciate it. But why on earth would I want a bowl of refried beans without anything to eat them with? When the food came they brought me the wrong quesadilla. The employee, without apology, took it back to get me the right one. I then sat for 8+ minutes without food. When the employee  finally brought the food I asked for the chips for the beans. I was told that I was wrong - it doesn't come that way. I replied \"well, could I get some chips?\" I was directed to go stand in line again to order them myself. I told the employee that I thought maybe, as an apology for making me wait so long for the correct food, he could just bring us some chips. The response I got was a blank stare and him walking away without a word. As I left I asked another employee if that person, in their pink windbreaker, was a manager. I was then informed that he infact was the manager. It's shocking that this person, with their inability to provide even a modicum of hospitality, is your manager on duty. It's unacceptable.",

I made the mistake of ordering their pork sandwich once and it was inedible. I tried to bite into the sandwich and couldn't even bite through because of how tough and rubbery the pork was. I don't understand why they slice the meat the way they do but it makes for a disgusting sandwich. The people raving on how good this place is are just locals who have never had anything better. You're better off going to Wawa for a sandwich. Seriously. It will at least be edible.",

Been twice now and I felt a review was necessary. \n\nPros: Birra Morretti on tap, sexy menu, chic decor, good service, octopus appetizer, squid ink pasta\n\nCons: Carpaccio is one of my favorite foods and this was not very good at all (no crostini, horseradish or arugula for one thing...and I don't know where the \"Italian kimchi\" was but of that is a play on words regarding the roasted capers then I'm not sure I follow their line of thinking -- kimchi is fermented cabbage after all), sticks on sticks on sticks of butter is used in preparation of the Carbonara which totally drowned out the taste of the guanciale and I didn't see the value at all in adding corn to the dish, Brussels sprouts are just okay but what's worse is that you smell like them for 2 days (I didn't even eat them the second time around and I still smell them today!), mushroom/fontina/truffle pizza and the Quattro formaggi/pancetta were too rich for my blood. This seemed to be the theme: too much burro. \n\nIf I go back, I will be getting Chicken Piccata because it's a great dish and very difficult to mess up.

    "text": "Over-rated. We brought out of town guests here because it was on their touristy wish list. We expected to wait in line, typical for Nashville, about 45 minutes, so no big deal. \n\nOnce seated we basically were at the mercy of the slowest waitress alive. We had a big day planned but our group of four spent nearly 2 hours of it sitting in a booth waiting on food, drink refills that never came and, after asking other servers to find our no show waitress, the check. No wonder there is a line to get when the table turnover is ridiculously slow!!\n\nAs for the food. Just \"meh\". After the hype and the wait I expected large, flavorful portions. The portions were on the small side and no one was impressed with the taste. I think my dish was the most well liked, Santa Fe Cornmeal Pancakes. They were hearty and unusual so they were a good pick. \n\nAll of us ordered a side of hashbrowns, and lucky we did or we would have been very hungry later on. But I did have to blot a good amount of oil off the potatoes and the bottom of the dish. I know that hashbrowns aren't a health food, so no biggie, just excessive. \n\nOverall, an eclectic tourist stop. I can't understand why locals would go. There are better, cheaper, faster and more delicious options all over town. Go if you have time to kill and a lot of patience.",

I bought 5 breasts last week to feed the family and there was virtually no meat on them. It's almost as if they cut the center out and there's only a little meat on both edges and a whole lot of breaded bone. It was ridiculous! Of course like an idiot I thought it was a fluke and bought another breast this week. Same thing. The other pieces are the usual size and quite tasty. I don't know what's going on but I would advise you not to buy the breasts even if you're a fan of white meat. They're the most expensive piece of chicken and not worth it at all. Otherwise the service is ok and when you call ahead it's ready for pickup about 75% of the time.",

They looked perfect when they came out, well pressed and the bread was outstanding.   Only thing wrong, they forgot the pork.  Went back to mamacita and showed her. She moved the ham, lettuce, pickle, and cheese and sure enough there was one slice of pork underneath.  I didn't know you could slice pork that thin. I'm glad she found the pork because when you looked through it you could see the one slice of salami underneath.  Still, you shouldn't need a map and local guide to find everything in a sandwich.  Then she gives me the \"whatsamattayou\" face.  The second Cuban  was the same.  No mistake.\n     I hate to run down what seemed like a family run business.  Maybe other things on the menu are good.  Stay clear of this place if you are looking for a good Cuban.  \n     Better yet, walk down to Nicahabana Cigars on 7th Ave. and watch them roll.  Go in, sit at the bar, have a cigar and watch real craftsmen work.  Cheap thrills for me.",

I saw this place got busy during lunch hour so gave a shot during weekday lunch. \nPlace was busy and I saw people getting salad with salmon so I got that one as well. \nMy salmon was dry... And lukewarm. Definitely didn't enjoyed my protein. I had only one visit so I can't speak for all but my salad wasn't fresh either that day. Sandwiches on other tables looked good though. That was my first and only trip to Marathon.",

    "text": "So...we visited GC for the first time on a rainy Thursday evening.  Hubby and I really like beer, but not all beer (we're not easy), so we were looking forward to trying this place.  It was packed, we waited about 30 minutes for our table...not bad.  The place is new.  Our server was trying really hard; a friendly guy, he was very enthusiastic.  He did forget to put in our food order, but he came by and told us of his mistake and offered a free app.   I had the Northern Lights Lager.  I really like lagers and wheat beers.  I'm NOT an ale girl at all so I was pleased to see choices other than ales (I'm looking at you Boscos and Cool Springs Brewery).  My husband ordered the American Wheat.  They were both OK, nothing special.  I had the tomato/basil flatbread, I wouldn't go back for that but I've had worse.  Overall we decided that we wouldn't break our necks to get back there but if we were with people who wanted to go...we wouldn't veto the choice either.  Not worth the \"A\" in \"A-OK\" for 3 stars.  It's a solid 2.5 \"OK\".  But since this is a new semester, I can't go around handing out half stars willy nilly.  We'll see...",

The woman who checked us out was yelling- in front of customers- at a coworker for not working (The other woman was doing something on the computer and there was a long line the Sunday after the CMAs of folks departing). The walls were so incredibly thin I could hear everything from the hallway- I literally had to stuff Kleenex in my ears to sleep because I refused to spend $5 for a pair of earplugs from the on site store. Food is not great and way over priced and you get nothing for the resort fee( even self parking is extra). The room smelled like dirty feet and was old. The worst part was it took 20 mins to get from the front desk to the room. And this hotel is no where near downtown- not worth it at all!",

    "text": "Sorry, no.\nHave visited twice, and those visits were months apart.\n\nTrip #1 had fried ravioli app that was quite good and pasta with shrimp that was not.  Way, way garlic heavy and runny, runny sauce.  Hubby had an average burger.  We both remembered it being loud, but we thought maybe still worth a second trip.\n\nTrip #2 they first tried to seat us right in front of the guitar player.  Asked to move upstairs, and still way loud.  Ordered the same fried ravioli app - way overcooked and disappointing.  This time I ordered the Shepherd's Pie, marked as one of their specialties and they are all a pub after all.  Wrong.  Big mistake.  Horrible.  Their Shepherd's Pie is a base of browned meat with something red speckled in (maybe pimentos?), with a huge slab or potatoes that were not creamy, not hot, and not flavorful.  And a HUGE slab.  Beside that there was obviously microwaved broccoli still way chunky and microwaved baby carrots... both absolutely plain except for a brown canned gravy poured over everything.  Gross.  I ate like three bites and lost my appetite and shoved aside.  When the waitress asked if I wanted a box and I said no.... you'd think she'd inquire, right?  No, she did not.\n\nHubby had a burger that was good, but in his words Five Guys a few storefronts up is better.  His steak fries were also good.\n\nWe don't drink beer, and this is clearly a sports and beer lovers place.  We tried, twice, and are done.  No, thank you.",

The bar was set pretty low, but my expectations still weren't met unfortunately. The restaurant itself is very difficult when it comes to customizing orders (for example they have shredded chicken for burritos but can't put the shredded chicken in a quesadilla). I don't think they realize it's literally the same thing just in a different form. \n\nThe wait staff was over bearing in my opinion. Our waitress kept butting into Over conversation when she came by with remarks like \"did I just hear you say you don't like corn?\" Im all about being friendly but \"was I talking to you?\" Made us help her clean the table bc she had another party coming in very soon.

We were greeted by a hostess who immediately seated us,  I asked her for any specials or soup of the day, she deferred to the waitress, fair enough!  I ordered the all you can eat rib tips with mashed potato and coleslaw and my other half ordered the Southwestern Chicken . My ribs came they were tender, tasty and hot, the  BBQ sauce was very tasty!, My mashed potato was great as well, but thats where it ended as far as the food went. my coleslaw was half filled with fluid and moist and soggy.  My Partners Southwest chicken was decidedly pre frozen, as was the frozen bean medley that was served for the vegetables. The rice was dry and mixed with packaged frozen vegetables straight from the grocery store. Maybe im old fashioned but i expect a bit more for $22.00. Aside from the Ribs the whole meal was disappointing.  The one bright spot in the whole meal was the Server Lady with grey hair, fast efficient and very friendly :-)  I hope i see her at Montana's cause thats where im gonna go for ribs next time.",

The concept of having a kiosk for ordering deli items is perfect but the system does not work. The first thing I do is place my order and do my shopping, mind you with a 2 year old, then go pick it up and check out. The past few times I have done this and my order has not been ready. I get they are busy, obviously that is why I use the kiosk.  Then when I ask about my order they act like how dare I bother them. Recently I got a response that they where understaffed and busy, but really 30 minutes!! They would never make a person standing there wait that long! I take my time shopping due mostly to the fact I have a freakin toddler. Anyway, they just do not have a sense of urgency or even employees that care to be efficient. I truly hope that this store does not continue to let me down because overall there products and prices are good.",

    "text": "UPDATE 6/23/12:  So we've been to Tortugas twice in the last year.  The first time, I had a nice big black chest hair (fingers crossed, let's HOPE it was a chest hair) in my taco.  That kept me from wanting to eat there for a looooong time.  Then we just went back recently and sat down in the restaurant.  The food was great, hot, tasted fresh, I can't complain at all about the food.  The server was another story.  We handed her a coupon and she had an attitude and a tone with us, stating that it had to be \"called in and would take a few minutes\".  Then she walked off leaving us standing at the register until someone else came and took care of us.  Listen Tortugas, coupons are incentives that get people's behinds in your seats. We don't want to deal with attitude problems just because we have a coupon that you have to do some extra overhead for.  After such a great meal, we left the restaurant talking about the rudeness of the server.  That's a shame.  See you in another year I guess Tortugas....\n\nUPDATE:  6/5/11:  I can't bring myself to eat here anymore.  The place does not seem clean.  The last time I was there, I found a hair in my taco.....A HAIR.  A big greasy hair.  It's a shame because Tortugas has some things going for it in the food department.  However, with other choices quickly springing up around it, Tortugas needs to get with the program before I'll ever go back there (if ever).  For now, even though it's been months since I ate there, I think about finding that hair every time I think about Tortugas.  And seriously Tortugas, do something about your debit card purchasing system, it's pathetic!  You have to pay money to do debit!!\n\nORIGINAL REVIEW:\n\nI've always liked Tortuga's, they are okay.  I really enjoy their chicken taco's and the nacho chips that come with the orders are really very good.  \n\nThey are not a great place to order take out from, its better to go there and eat.  When I order the chicken tacos to go, I find that they are VERY water logged when I get them home and the once crispy shell falls apart right in my hands.  Generous amounts of chips and salsa are given and that is always appreciated.  I do agree that they are overpriced though.  \n\nThey really need to update their debit card system or something, it always takes longer than usual when I'm paying with a card and I think they even have a surcharge for using a card!",

Maybe they had not begun to expand as a result of the absorption of knowledge or as a result of other \"mind expanding\" things that happen in college (allegedly).  Anyway, from then on, freshmen were dubbed \"littleheads.\"  As in; \"Hey, here comes some littleheads, lets eff with them!\"\n\nAnyway, when we stopped in here for a late dinner the place seemed to be populated with...littleheads.  Dining, serving, etc.  This impression was not helped by the fact that past of the lighting in this place is accented with blacklights.  Certainly an unusual choice.  It took me a moment to figure out why the couple in the back had such oddly glowing teeth.\n\nSo I opted for a small pizza, I think it was the \"Caruso Supreme\" or something.  It wasn't very good.  I tasted my wife's chicken parm and it was probably in the 3 star neighborhood.\n\nOverall, Caruso's was a disappointment.  Interesting, but a disappointment.  Seems like the place where the local college kids go for a \"nice dinner out.\"",

    "text": "Living the Square and close to a lot of great restaurants within our neighborhood and downtown, this is probably my least favorite..\n\nLet me explain. First off. The tacos are good but not great. I typically eat tacos like these at authentic joints in the city, and these just don't compare to the real thing. The price is ok considering the tacos aren't anything special..The only one I like is the potato..or papas taco.\n\nAlso. This is what really brings their review down to two stars. You say you specialize in tequila but when I ask for a fresh margarita I get the bottle crap over ice. That's not what I asked for. I said FRESH. That means you actually make me a drink like you should and not give me that nasty sugary crap. So there you have it. That's why it gets two stars from me.",

The Taco Bell doesn't even show up on the Taco Bell restaurant locator--I checked their website afterward.\n\nI wanted a chalupa and a Diet Coke.  And a bean burrito.  And a taco.  I was desperate, yet this is a VERY iffy neighborhood, even in the daytime.  My lilly-white ass had a rental car, so I looked around as I pulled into the drive-thru.\n\nSeriously, just after I placed my order in the call box, a tricked out Monte Carlo with spinners blasting G-Unit pulled up behind me with four thugs and a shawty laughing and shaking their car.  And the hoopty in front of me was bumping Lil Wayne.  Aw, DAMN.

The green corn tamale was solid masa, no cheese or corn in sight. The beef taco was flavorless and the taco shell was soggy and fell apart with the first bite. With an order of average guacamole and chips, my bill was over ten dollars and I had to pick up at the counter and eat out of a styrofoam carry out box. Even their famous tortilla was uninspiring, served in a plastic bag, wrapped around a plastic fork. There are many other places in Tucson for good Mexican food.

Our server didn't come over for 15 min, although we did get drinks from a busboy. When she finally came over we were rushed through our order and weren't told any specials they might have had. Ordered mussels for an app, and when they were brought out we had to sit there and look at them for another few minutes since we were never brought utensils, plates, or even those awesome cheddar biscuits. Our server seemed to be doing a good job of avoiding us, so we had to flag down someone else to get them for us. \n\nMain course comes out, never got the salad I ordered so had to ask for that. I ordered the steak and shrimp. Asked for medium rare, got well done. Still tasty though. My boyfriend got the bar harbor lobster bake. No complaints there... Lots of seafood, three small lobster tails all over pasta. \n\nI won't get into every detail of the terrible service, let's just say it was almost comical at the end of the night how bad it got. The food was the only redeeming factor though. Pretty good for a national chain seafood restaurant. Definitely recommend the bar harbor lobster bake.",

The donuts were nothing to write home about, didn't taste particularly fresh and there weren't many options to chose from. Most of the ones in the delicious looking yelp pics were not available. I went around 12pm so perhaps coming in the morning you may have a better experience. \n\n The sliders were good, a little pricey at $3.25 a pop when two definitely aren't going to fill you up. The waffle fries themselves were pretty good, stay away from the cheese sauce though. It was waaay too thick and just had an odd consistency overall. It tasted like the time I tried to make homemade nacho cheese sauce at home, it had a roux consistency but for my personal tastes, didn't pair well with the fries or even taste particularly cheesy.\n\nNot worth the price in my opinion but I did enjoy the atmosphere.",

I really appreciate the lack of added sugars or overuse of ice. However, my first experience far exceeded my most recent visit. The inconsistency in the smoothies makes me hesitant to return. I ordered the same smoothie on both visits. On my second visit, the employee admitted he didn't know how to make all of the menu options; he could definitely use better training. I received a smoothie that likely had all of the listed ingredients, but the proportions of those ingredients were way off. My smoothie only tasted like lemon and celery. It was too sour to finish.

The menu online only lists one kind of \"monkey bread\"-garlic and parmesan. \nWhen the food arrives I open the \"monkey bread\" and find bread knots with cinnamon and frosting......\nSo I call back thinking I had mistakenly gotten something from another customer's order. \nTurns out there are two types of \"monkey bread\" and I ended up with something I didn't want. \nThey offered to give us a free \"monkey bread\" the next time we ordered from them or would give us one now if WE DROVE THERE to pick it up!!!!!\nAre you kidding??! I've got hot pizza that you just delivered and I'm supposed to let it get cold driving to your restaurant to fix something you screwed up???!!!\nHow in the world could we have known there was another kind of \"monkey bread\" if it's not listed on the menu??!!! \nIt was their responsibility to clarify when they took the order. \nNot sure if the owner reads or cares about the reviews online.....\nDoesn't seem that way.....\nIt's a shame because the pizza was pretty good. \nHad they just said \"we'll make this right and bring you the garlic and parmesan in a few\" they would've had a new long-time customer (and we have three kids so pizza is a staple in our home!). \nInstead I'll be ordering from the competition next time. \nNow I'll be looking for good pizza AND good service from another place because I'm sure not going to find it here.",

Since Honeys is one of our favorite places to get brunch, we knew that we would have to wait up to an hour for a table. Since they have such good food, it's worth it.\n\nBut this is why I'm no longer going to go there, and the reason for the two star rating:\n\nThe hostess was horrible. There is only ONE table that can seat up to 8 people. We went in, she told us that the previous party has been sitting there for a while and would be done at any minuet. She also told us that we would be the next people to sit down. We thought, great! since they were putting on their coats and getting ready to leave.\n\nAfter the staff was finished cleaning up the dishes from the table, the host sat down A PARTY OF THREE PEOPLE. that also, CAME AFTER US!!! I just don't get it. There were plenty of other tables available, so why sit a party of 3 at the only table that can comfortably sit 8? \n\nI understand going to Honey's with a party of 7 isnt the smartest idea, but when the hostess tells us that we would be next in line for that large table,and then sits 3 people, that is the dumbest thing ever.\n\nNeedless to say,I am never going there again. They blew it, they lost our business.\n\n\n we left and ate at the foodery on 837 N 2nd St.",

    "text": "Took a tip from a local in Dunedin who suggested this restaurant and our experience was far from what she described. This was our first and definitely last time coming here. There was only two tables when we came in but it still took the waitress 10 minutes to seat us. The menus are about the size of a phone book and heavier than one too, but they do have lights inside of them which I thought was pretty cool. We asked for the fresh cooked bread for the table to snack on while we decided what we were all going to eat. When the waitress brought out the bread, she apologized and said they ran out and had to buy the bread from Winn Dixie...my whole table was a little taken back that she even was upfront about that. Not sure how an Italian restaurant can run out of their home made bread, especially when the place was dead. In the middle of ordering the appetizer our waitress just walked away pretending not to hear us. She did that a couple more times when we asked for a few more things for the table like steak sauce and lemons. I would NOT recommend the calamari, it came out shriveled up and dry. It took the waitress another 15 minutes to realize everyone's drinks at the table were empty before we had to flag her down to grab us all refills. I do have to say the shrimp scampi and the steak dinner special were really good and the cannoli was also. Management here should truly train their staff better, because the service was complete crap. There are a handful of other Italian places around Dunedin and I would for sure recommend to spend your money elsewhere instead of wasting it here.",

I ordered a Roast Beef on French dressed. The chicken salad was so salty my sister could not eat it. The roast beef was half burnt. The lettuce was a dark green, not sure what kind. The tomatoes and pickles were cut very thick not adding to what I thought would be a tasteful experience . \nI have been a frequent customer and have never had anything I didn't like served to me. We told the waitress what had happened. She tried her best to make things right under the circumstances. In the end we were only charged for the potato salad and one drink. \nAt no time did the present manager come to speak to us preferring to let the waitress handle the situation. We were also told there was a different cook in the afternoon preparing the food. \nI was very disappointed as I had brought my sister there as a treat and to introduce her to Coffee &. Needless to say we were both disappointed. Not sure if I will be back---if ever.",

    "text": "As the saying goes, first impressions last. After passing by this sushi joint a lot of times, ive finally tried it tonight. It wasnt a really good experience for me. Bad points first before the good. First, maybe because it was a Friday night thats why it took us a while to be seated, not too big of a deal. So I would suggest not coming in on a Friday night. Second, when it comes to ordering food, you must understand that customers who had already waited to be seated are hungry. So better make up on the service. We waited for like 15mins for our orders to be taken (despite the hand wavering- a call for attention). Third, more so another 20 mins or so for our rolls to come out! Hungry turned into Hangry! I appreciated their apology saying the kitchen was behind on orders. The thing is, shouldnt they prepared on a Friday night? Anyway, we ordered 5 rolls. Cant say they're the best cos ive had way better and tastier ones. The place is nice though, spacious and neat. The price of the rolls are good enough.\n\nIn conclusion, service was not exceptional (or maybe its just our server) compared to similar joints and as a sushi lover, there was nothing too special and unique about the rolls.",

    "text": "Quick shout outs - our server, Jordan, worked really hard to make our meal enjoyable.  He was prompt and responsive and my family and I really appreciated his effort.\n\nNow to the review - the food was pretty good, when it came out correct...We are vegetarian and ordered the Brussel sprouts (without bacon), two pizzas (margharita and potato) and one pasta (arrabiata).  When the person brought the Brussel sprouts to the table, she said there was no meat...but in my first bite I had a piece of bacon. Definitely disappointed from that experience.  Luckily they paid extra attention to the rest of our order and made sure everything was correct.  I think the kitchen at this place is very overwhelmed...\n\nThis actually leads to the main reason for the 2-star review.  We made a reservation for 6 at 7:30p.  When we got there at 7:25p they told us that the had 2 other parties of 6 that needed to be seated before us and the kitchen was running behind.  We said that we had a reservation but apparently so did the other parties.  Why in the world would they book three reservations at the same time when they clearly didn't have the space/ability to accommodate?! We heard similar comments about why even make a reservation from most of the people waiting in the waiting area.  When we finally got seated...30 mins after our reservation...it was at a make shift table that was extremely tight without sufficient space for all our plates. \n\nThe food was the redeeming quality for my experience.  My brother said that he had a similar experience the last time he came here for dinner.  Eventually the negative experience is going to outweigh the quality of food...and I feel that's going to happen pretty quick. They need to figure something out to turn around the service, and fast.",

Last week, ordered a burger medium rare with fries.  Pretty simple.  Well, the burger came out more on the well side, and you could tell it was a frozen pre-manufacured burger. The burger also tasted like it was old/bad also.  The fries were the typical frozen bar fries.  Not sure why places like this dont slice their own.  Its cheaper, easier, and taste better.  Drinks are poured OK, but nothing to get excited about.\n\nOverall, if you going to watch a game and not expecting great bar food, then why not try it.

The employees looked at me with almost disqust that I was in there. Not that I'm one of those people but maybe I was the wrong white girl in the wrong neighborhood at the wrong time? Not really sure. It's pretty much almost downtown past the arch right off 70 so it was convenient. It was pretty clean for the most part as well. Just didn't like the whole vibe going on inside.",

    "text": "When I went the Jamaican Jerk Hut, it was for a very specific purpose.  We had two vegetarians, wanted to BYOB, and wanted a place that isn't too expensive.\n\nThe Jerk Hut is cheap for a reason.  Service includes you ordering at a counter, and waiting around for one of the two employees to take the order.  It's not that they were being lazy, the phone was ringing off the hook, even on a Monday.  Inside, there is a few seats.  They were working on a large outdoor patio in the back, which I can only imagine is perfect on summer nights.\n\nBesides reagge playing, there isn't much of an ambiance.  We saw three ants crawling on the counter when we were paying.  So why go to a place with basic service and little atmosphere?\n\nIt's the food.  I had the jerk chicken, and it was the most amazingly flavored piece of meat I've had in recent memory.  My friends also seemed to enjoy their dishes.  The side of plantains I ordered perfectly complimented my meal.  Honestly, I would recommend this place for takeout, especially if you can't eat outside.  The good tastes good enough to overcome what the restaurant lacks otherwise.",

    "text": "We decided to eat late lunch here on a Friday, after visiting a nearby museum.   We were asked to wait at the bar for a table and probably would have waited even longer had we not taken the initiative to ask the  hostess again to seat us at one of the open tables (\"Oh yeah, sure, go ahead...\").   I was pretty excited about this place having read all the rave reviews.  We ordered some drinks and deliberated long and hard on what we wanted our burgers to look like.  I opted for mushrooms & fried egg on mine, and husband asked for crab salad on his.  We patiently munched on tater tots as we waited for our burgers and fries.  When these hefty sandwiches finally arrived at our table, we oohed and aahed a bit before digging in.  The first bite was quite tasty I'll admit, the patty nicely seasoned.  Though I ordered mine medium, it came out medium rare.  A couple more bites and the whole thing just started to fall apart.  Before long, the burger was swimming in a pool of meat juice and egg yolk, not the most appetizing thing to look at.  I didn't manage to finish mine, but I liked it well enough.  \nI think that  the main problem, though, was that we weren't blown away by any aspect of the meal.  It was just... nice.  I don't know if I'm comfortable shelling out close to $70 for burgers  for two (with a couple of cocktails & potatoes on the side) and have it be just NICE.",

    "text": "The food here is quite palatable, but I can speak only for the pho. In comparison to Miss Saigon on the other side of the parking lot, Kien Giang establishes a more low key, cafeteria-esque vibe on the fringes of the plaza. The orderly tables each correspond to a particular number. The hostess directed us to one promptly before a server arrived within minutes to take our orders. I dined on the most varied pho dish on the menu, I believe it was the first one on the list. The restaurant provides several sauces and condiments on the side for patron perusal. I found the broth just savory and sweet enough, although sorely lacking in fish sauce.\n\nWhile the food was quite delicious and lived up to expectations, service was sadly askew. The waitstaff and chefs took turns ogling us as we waited, occasionally snickering and scoffing. To add insult to injury, the not-so-prominently displayed \"cash or check only\" sign left our party scrambling for an ATM. NOT to mention a sexist, rude patron strides up during our frantic search for cash to afford the pompous comment, \"Next time, get some richer girlfriends.\" Pretentious, suffice to say. All the while, the staff at the register openly glared, whispered in Vietnamese, rolled their eyes, and broke into uncontrollable laughter. I have never been in an environment where the waitstaff expressed this level of condescension to its patron.\n\nI'll pass on the attitude despite the decent food. Not worth a second glance. As someone who has had pho in Hanoi, the staff just make this experience extremely unforgiving.",

I personally recommend staying away from take out there is always something that goes wrong when we do take out. We have had great experiences here and the food can be amazing, but it is can be terrible too. I feel the only time they really pay attention and make food great is when you came in after a bad experience and complained. They forgot to put in our take-out order, and my husband ended up waiting an extra hour. The next time the manager did buy our meal, and make sure everything was perfect. The chicken Modega was amazing. My husband's chicken spedini was great, but then we go two weeks later, and we receive lackluster food. My chicken Modega plate is flooded with sauce and the asparagus is cold. We decided to stay away after that experience. Last night we wanted something quick on the way home. So we ordered take out. Not the worst things happened but it's the annoying attentions to detail that are a little aggravating. No dressing for the salad, and no butter for the bread. Being busy on the inside doesn't make your takeout customers less important. That's how you are treated for takeout it seems. I have had a love hate relationship with Joey B's, but I'll think twice before going there ever again.",

Not sure i can capture how bad the exchange was in this review, but it ended with my wife feeling confused and uncomfortable, and myself literally asking the employee \"how difficult can this be?\"  That employee took what should have been a 4 star experience and made it a 2 star experience.  The employee was quizzing us on the menu, not providing any answers and not being helpful in the least.  So I checked Yelp and it appears others have had similar experiences.

We put in our dinner orders right away. When she gave us our dishes a few minutes later, she disappeared. We were finished our meals and sitting for 8-10 minutes when she reappeared. By that time, she asked about dessert and tried to go get us a menu but again, we knew we couldn't let her out of our sight without losing her forever. When we placed our orders, we agreed to each other to ask for the check when she dropped the desserts. Of course, she had a runner come to our two top with our desserts. One and a half hours for a dinner/dessert for two (no drinks) in a quiet restaurant is absurd. The food was fine, but not worth the frustration and invisible customer status.",

    "text": "I was in town with friends and we reserved two lanes for our event complete with food. Upon entry, I was impressed by the decor, technology and general ambiance of the bowling alley. Check-in was cumbersome. One of my friends gave our groups name and it appeared as though the associate was unable to immediately locate our reservation. We reserved the lanes months in advance. Within about 10  minutes which felt like forever, we were asked our shoe sizes and escorted to our lanes. The associates place the names of the players on the scorecards for you and I liked the efficiency of placing all rental shoes in a basket and escorting us to our lanes. There are not many lanes available, but maybe they don't need it. it was a Saturday night and the place wasn't packed but then again, it was 7pm and maybe the crowd picks up later. I could definitely see this place being easy to convert to a club scene for the younger people (I'm not that old but I'm flirting with 40). Our section had our food placed in beautiful silver warmers that closed. The offerings were roasted vegetable quesadillas, popcorn shrimp and griddled beef sliders. Presentation gets 5 stars!! The taste was ok.\n\nOur server introduced herself to us and I placed my order for my regular drink of choice - Tito's with a splash of tonic. I received my drink, tasted it and well, the bartender was extremely heavy on the tonic. Not wanting to be a problem, I drank it and upon ordering my 2nd I reiterated to the server that I would like a SPLASH of tonic or if it would be easier to just give me Tito's on the rocks with a side of tonic, like a shot glass full so that I could ensure my drink wasn't tonic heavy. I don't need a double pour, just not a lot of tonic :-) Well, she returned with my second drink and hallelujah!! It was perfect! This of course led to a 3rd drink (don't judge me).\n\nThe food was pretty good but the service regarding the cleanliness of the food area was superb. I swear, the young man made sure that area was spotless and I truly appreciated that. 5 stars on that, he was amazing and committed.\n\nSo why the 2 stars? The technical functions of the lanes. I have never seen pins on strings before. That was new, but that's not why this place is only getting 3 stars. The lane kept malfunctioning. We would bowl and the arm would remove the pins, well, pull them up and then reset the others. Then it would do it again and again. This usually took about 3 minutes which once, you add it up, equates to a significant amount of time lost when you are paying by the hour for 4 people per lane. I informed the associate about the problem and he said he would go in the back to check. I'm not sure if he did or didn't because 15 minutes later, we were still having the same problem. I again went to the associate and he said he would reset it. It seemed to have worked but 5 minutes later, back to the old technical difficulties. By this time, I was over bowling and this entire experience and the failure to resolve the issue. \n\nSo if it had not been for the food set-up and the young man always making sure our food area was impeccable, this place would have received 1 star.",

This dish was edible but over priced $8.95 taco salad+ $2.50 for shrimp+ 1.00 for guacamole ( a tablespoon serving size) and I ordered a reg margarita in the rocks no sour mix, it was disgusting, I asked them to remake the drink in which they did but I had to settle for an overly sweet/sour drink. The customer service was great. However we went on a Sunday evening at 5 so there was a long wait time and the waiters/waitresses were very busy",

We had the pepperoni, socrates revenge, and bronx bomber.  It's like a eatting a brick of salt.  I'm not sure if it's the amount of salt sauce combined with the salty meat, but the combo so overwhelming, I tastebuds are numb to any other flavor.  Otherwise, if they fix that, I would love it.  \n\nAs for the salads, they're a good size, but seems like something you can toss together yourself.

    "text": "I went for an early dinner (5:30 pm) on a Saturday evening to celebrate my daughter's birthday. Four adults in our party. The wait to be seated wasn't long even though the place was pretty crowded. However, the wait for our order to be taken and for all the food was much longer than is should have been. The food was good, nothing spectacular, but tasty and the portions were large. The pan fried dumplings were very good and well presented. The egg rolls were not crispy, as I expected, but were very good and came with a delicious mild sweet mustard sauce. Son-in-law had the Buddha's Delight, which seemed fresh and appealing. My chicken fried rice was fine, I've had better but still it was nothing to complain about.  The real problem came when we asked the server to bring the check. Since my son and I were hosting my daughter and her husband, we wanted to split the check between us. Then the server told us that their credit card machine was \"still\" down (as if we were supposed to already know about it) and that she would have to run it by hand so she could not split the check because it would be too complicated and would require her to figure out the tax herself and that it would take too long. She then brought us four separate checks, expecting all of us to pay individually. So I took two and my son took two and gave her our credit cards. Again, the server told us we couldn't do it that way. My son politely insisted. We weren't asking her for a miracle, only to run the cards by hand as every merchant did before the days of electronic credit card readers. Finally she said that she would \"try\" but it would probably take too long.  She was quite rude about all this, with no apology. We had not been warned ahead of time that there was a problem with the credit card machine. It wasn't until we had already had our meal that we were told of the problem. We should have been informed about it at our arrival. In the end we were able to work it out but she was quite ungracious about the whole thing. Between that and the long waits for our appetizers and meals, I can't recommend this particular P.F. Changs.",

This time we decided we will not be in a hurry to come back and give it a third try.  Foo foo phooey Italian food and too expense with poor value.  \nCute hostess that greeted us was very friendly, held the door, and seated us immediately.  The service was excellent this time... our dinners came out of the kitchen quickly (although the restaurant was pretty empty except for a large party of 40 for a private affair dining on the patio), our server Jordan was attentive, and the busboy had a great sense of humor and constantly came by to check on us and refill our water glasses, BUT the Alfredo sauce was the worst we've ever had (very disappointing) and the although the homemade sausage was plentiful, just okay if you like Italian sausage (not too spicy... though we would not get it again with Fettuccine Alfredo).  The Cannelloni with chicken had a better tasting sauce, very different for an entree.  BUT overall, the prices on this menu are too high for a la carte or a weekday dinner, and we ordered the least expensive pasta entrees.  Not a vegetable or a small dinner salad are served with the entrees.  No linquini with clam sauce or spaghetti with meatballs, no lasagna, no traditional Italian dishes, and most prices are $15 and up, up, up.  Olive Garden is a much better value with a larger selection of entrees and all the soup or salad you can eat, or even Zona 78 nearby is better (that is probably why they were packed and there was a 45 minute wait for a table).  And the hot bread we were served when we first sat down was just plain weird.... nothing special.  \nThe chef came out of the kitchen to visit with a celebrity diner (Jim Click) for a long time, and when he passed us (the only other diners in the restaurant in that area) on his way back to the kitchen, he did not even acknowledge us, or say hello, or ask if every thing was okay.

    "text": "We were vacationing in Florida, and someone recommended that we go to Tarpon Springs for a great Greek dinner.  I love Greek food, especially fresh seafood.  We picked Hellas based on its ratings.  A mistake.  \n\nThe best thing we got was the cold plate appetizer.  I was surprised it did not come with fresh pita, but it all tasted good.  We also got a salad and it was ok.  Hard to mess up a salad.\n\nThen came the entrees. Our son got the squid.  The menu said it was \"lightly coated with flour and pan fried to perfection.\"  Nope.  The coating was thick and mouth coating.  The squid was overcooked like rubber.  I got the \"Greek style\" grouper.  Again, it was heavily battered with little seasoning.  The batter, like the squid, was mouth coating.  The fish was over cooked and greasy.  \"Greek style\" I suppose referred to the fact that they dumped some nasty granulated garlic (not fresh) over the top of the deep fried fillet.  My wife got Greek style scallops.  I did not try them, but she pronounced that the dish was like something they would serve in a nursing home.  Everything came with bland rice and dull overcooked peas.  Nothing fresh.\n\nWe salvaged dinner with baklava from the attached bakery, and it was good.",

The wait staff were nice enough and somewhat attentive, but slow. \n\nThe main event of course was the food. I was in a rush and ordered a beef  taco and an enchilada (boring I know).

The service seems to be suffering on my last couple of visits. They had three hostesses and a host rotating around the restaurant but somehow it took the waitress 40 minutes to take our order and bring out our food. When the shrimp and grits arrived the shrimp were room temperature at best. The grits were warm, likely secondary to the hot iron skillet. The portions are undersized. I don't want to go to apple-bees and get 10 pounds of food, but I would like my entree priced at $20 plus to be larger than an appetizer. \n\nAlso, do they really have to serve diet coke in an 8 oz bottle. Can they just give a large glass which will be refilled like every other restaurant? I feel like the drink seems to be a way to generate revenue. It was ha hassle.\n\nI also would have ordered dessert but the service was so slow that I didn't know how long it would be until we got out of there. \n\nIn short good food, undersized portions with mediocre service.\n\nMaybe, they should transition one of the five host/hostesses to wait staff to minimize this problem.\n\nWon't be eating here until this is fixed.",

We had a large party (4 adults - 4 children), and they were able to accommodate our party within a reasonable time - we didn't wait more than 20 minutes for a table.  Pretty good start.\n\nThe hostess was friendly, and smiled, and let us know that the wait wasn't horrible, and offered us menus to look at while we waited.  The rest of the staff seemed friendly, and it appeared managers were table touching to make sure the guest experience was good.\n\nIt's from here that things started to go downhill.  First off, the seating in the dining room is VERY cramped, at least where we were led.  The tables were close together, and the place was stuffed with people.  It was difficult to move our party to the seats, and even more difficult to use the facilities and eventually leave - especially with a car seat and three little ones in tow.  If you have small children, car seats, wheelchairs, etc. - ask to sit in the area where you enter; the most space to move about is there.\n\nThe food came out slow - almost an hour.  The hash browns were cold.  The bacon was limp, with one near-raw - and we had specifically asked for crisp bacon when we ordered.  We were missing a glass of milk.  We were short silverware, napkins, and syrup.  We had three orders of pancakes on the table with no syrup.  Odd, for a pancake house.\n\nMy wife and I each had eggs benedict - very average.  One of the poached eggs was overcooked, and the other was under cooked.  I tried a little of everything on the table - from omelets to biscuits and gravy to pancakes - and it was all very, very average.  I was excited and happy to see another breakfast spot pop up close to the house, but we won't be returning.  For our money, we'll go somewhere else or simply eat at home.",

    "text": "It's a chain restaurant, you get what you expect from chain stores and that is an empty wallet and a 50/50 shot of coming away satisfied. \n\nI've been to this location 3 times since it opened, positives and negatives come out each time but never a full on, \"I'm definitely coming back here\" moment. The menu itself is overwhelming and takes an average person a decade to reach the last page, ever wonder why this place is always jam packed? No one is sure what they want when they've read a novel of a menu. Most restaurants specialize in one or two areas but not here, you have mexican next to Italian with american holding hands with God knows what. With a menu this large always remember these items are rarely fresh made and more likely prepped, refrigerated, warmed up, topped then served. Yay for microwaved $8 soup. \n\nAfter the disastrous menu combinations comes the decision of a lifetime. I've had the safe choice twice before (Club Sandwich) but this last and possibly final time I chose the Parmesan Chicken Sandwich, Potato Soup and Fries. Ok, I deeply liked the lukewarm potato soup (insert sarcasm). But honestly that was the highlight here. The Parmesan Sandwich was overwhelmingly tasteless with peppers and onions the only distinctive taste that stood out. The chicken tasteless, the sauce ruined by the peppers and onions and the cheese cold and pressed into the bread. So basically I had potato soup with fries, yay carbs. Please don't ask your server what's good or what sells the best, the response is the same all three times, \"All of it is really good\" and that narrows down the \"numbered\" pages of the menu. \n\nMy wife loves the chicken medley however she, like me is too afraid to waiver from what tastes ok to try a dish as horrid as mine. We also took home a slice of cheesecake (strawberry and pumpkin). This, was the only highlight of this epic failure. But I swear I can get almost the same quality from Wal-Mart as sad as that is to say. My only wish is that I didn't go for fast food, sad right?  But I will be back to tackle another dish, I refuse to believe there's nothing here that's edible.",

I've been here a few times with them and have never been impressed, but after today felt the need to write about it.\n\nUsually when I order a 7-9 dollar cheesesteak I save half for another time so I don't feel like I'm over-eating. When my chicken cheesesteak was put in front of me today I had to ask the waiter if the cook accidentally used only half the normal portion of meat. I've never seen such an empty steak sandwich in my life and easily housed the whole thing, plus the measly pickle spear and miniature bag of chips. \n\nAfter confronting the waiter he asked me if I wanted another and I told him \"no, not if this is the normal portion size. Do they always look so empty?\" I won't quote the waiter exactly but his reply was along the lines of that's the normal portion size but the chef doesn't know what he's doing and that's why it looks small. \n\nThis was a disgrace of a cheesesteak, and thus worthy of a 2 star review considering all the times I've eaten here in the past have been a solid \"Meh\".",

I called ahead to make reservations and specifically informed them of our anniversary and that every year we dine there as our tradition.   Usually we are offered free champagne and thanked for spending our time with them, but not this year.  Food was terrible and service was even worse. The summer corn salad was the best part of the entire meal.  The mixed grill was awful and not worth the 46 dollars.   The filet and lamb were tasteless and the ribs were a mushy mess of bones with very little meat. The delmonico steak was ok but again not worth the 42 dollars.  I would've loved another drink to try to forget this horrible experience, but the waitress never return after the dinner was served to see how everything was, and if we needed anything.  Overall it was an extremely disappointing experience, from the food to the service.  My wife left hungry, which is unfortunate for the money we spent.  Looks like we'll be looking for a new tradition next year.",

No water was delivered!! I decided I would order an iced mocha and it was brought promptly. It was not your typical iced mocha. When I asked how they prepared it he said they mixed \"the syrup\" with their prepared iced coffee. I asked what type of syrup and he said it was something like German white chocolate? Waiter said \"This is how WE make it\". I suppose I should have asked how they make it before I ordered it. I asked if they had any hershey syrup I could mix in to make it better and he said no. He did not charge me for the coffee, though, at least that was OK. Iced mochas usually are milk and espresso and some sort of thick dark chocolate syrup mixture. This might have been some sort of Torino syrup. Horrible. He brought me water instead (finally). \n\nAnyway, the eggs and bacon were good, french toast was barely warm. I had to ask for more butter, which didn't melt on the french toast. Syrup was cold, don't know if I could have asked for warm syrup or not. The hash browns were not good. Again, barely warm. The dark parts were cooked straight on the grill with no oil to make them deliciously crispy. As a result they were just hard and tasted a bit burned. I ate the inside part with salt and ketchup. \n\nReasonably priced meal ($10.29) but I expected more from a specialty restaurant like this.

    "text": "We had a date night with our friends at the Red Pony awhile back. We love the ambience of downtown Franklin so we were excited to try the Red Pony. We made reservations which I would recommend. We got there a few minutes early and enjoyed an amazing Moscow Mule at the bar. Then we were taken upstairs to our table where a very friendly waiter spent EXCESSIVE amount time describing the menu and all the specials. It was way overkill. We ordered the calamari appetizer which was chewy and rubbery and not in a good calamari way. I ordered their chicken dish which was okay but my husband ordered their ribeye medium which was way over cooked. For such high prices and a long introduction into their menu you would have thought the food was to die for. I gave it 2 stars because the mule was awesome and the service friendly.",

However, I managed to make it to the back of the store and passed up not one, but at least 4 sales associates and not one acknowledged me. I probably spent a total of 10mins in the store, and eventually stopped looking for a TV stand. At that point, I had already made up my mind that I wasn't buying anything from this location because of the customer service.",

The tanks are amazing and the artwork is great, but the service and food was pretty awful. \n\nMy family and I went in for breakfast this morning (their last day of breakfast service apparently- and I could see why). There were only a couple of families there and it was quiet and dark- not really a beach my vibe but would be nice for dinner. Our waiter was ridiculous- totally out of it. He asked me what I wanted to eat twice when ordering and came back a third time to verify what I had meant (I ordered crab cakes & poached eggs- exactly what it says on the menu and he wanted to make sure I meant crab cake Benedict). \n\nWhen the food did come out, my breakfast was missing several items- scallions, arugula and toast. I asked about the toast and was told my breakfast did not come with any. He said brought some anyway to be nice. Hah. And then we ate- not worth the $16 price tag. Not even close. The potatoes were good but the meal was lacking and not impressive. Ultimately very disappointing. No one at my table particularly enjoyed their meals. \n\nOn the way out, we saw their outdoor seating area and bar, a beautiful, well lit area absolutely perfect for breakfast- if they'd been serving breakfast I think they may have had better luck with making a profit. \n\nI don't think I'd go back for food ever, but perhaps after I stop being bitter over the price of a crap breakfast with missing food I'll stop in for a cocktail at the pretty bar area!",

I spent $21 on a pie that would be equal to a papa johns (who i believe uses fresh schrooms) and pizza hut and i think would have been cheaper Their box says use better ingredients, i truly believe fresher is better.

The waiter, who by the way was outstanding, brings the steak,  it is cut in half length wise making it the thinnest steak I have ever seen in an Outback.  We send it back, out it comes again and delivered by the manager, cut properly but still the thinnest stake we have ever been served at an Outback.  I make this observation to the manager, he ignores what is said and moves on.  The rest of the meal is good.  We decide on splitting a slice of carrot cake, because the portions are always generous, and ask for it to go.,  It was the thinnest slice of cake I think I have ever seen, certainly not worth $5.00.  Compared to other Outbacks, I would guess this one is VERY profitable, as it appears they are controlling costs by thinning portions.",

I really think that they meant York City, PA style bagel.  \n\nWhat really got me though was each NOT both bagel and lox was $10.75 and our total bill for just two bagels and lox (with tax) just shy of $23 - and that did not include any drinks, etc. \n\nBased on the price along I would not return, but the listless bagel was pretty bad too.",

The guy was pretty terrible and began by asking for requests from customers but didn't know any of the requested songs. Instead, he sang some \"originals\" that reinforced my two star rating. \n\nMy advice... Catch a taxi or drive downtown and enjoy the real Nashville atmosphere and cuisine this place is trying to reproduce.",

My friend, however, ordered a full entree for $26 and she said it was subpar at best. The fries were soft and the schnitzel didn't have much flavor. It was a $30 fried meal basically. The staff also seemed inexperienced. They were nice though. \n\nI know we didn't have to order what we ordered. Maybe if we had ordered something else, our experience would have been better, but overall we weren't impressed.",

    "text": "Surprised this place is rated so high. I love sushi. With a name like crazy sushi I was really hesitant. It's kinda like any place who has a weird name like that is a red flag but the reviews were so good I figured what the heck. The sashimi I had was a large portion, but the tuna was clearly dyed as it was so red it was nearly purple. I didn't touch the salmon. The bonsai tree roll that is wrapped in cucumber was soggy. The spicy tuna roll was stuffed with filling hardly any rice. The yellowtail roll was pure flakes and no fish. The miso was good though. Fresh and a good amount of miso. I asked for extra ginger, was on the receipt, and received none. So if you want miso check out if you know anything about sushi pass. Delivery was an hour, I was told 20 minutes. The guy on phone had me screaming my order it seemed really busy and he was super rushed. Pass on them.",

I tell everyone to come here because it's the only Notre Dame bar in the city and it's usually a great time.  Last night, this was not the case.  My roommates and I came here for the ND/MSU game and I'm sad to say, we probably won't be back.\n\nWe ordered some food and were somewhat disappointed.  Buffalo chicken cheesesteak was decent, grilled chicken wrap was as to be expected, and the chicken tenders....crunchy, possibly re-fried and on a bed of lettuce...$13 for 3 chicken tenders, one of which was so damn tiny, it shouldn't even be counted as a chicken tender.  We also had to track down a waitress to ask for forks and napkins.  When we were finished, our plates sat there until I finally decided to move them to an empty end of the bar table we were at.\n\nAfter our first round, I waited at least 20 minutes at the bar before a bartender even made eye contact with me.  I'm not sure where the 2nd bartender was, but she seemed to be having some sort of personal issue, as she was in and out on her cell phone the whole time.\n\nAll in all, they just seemed short-staffed and overwhelmed last night.  I'm disappointed because I really do love this place and have good memories here.  Sad to say, I'll have to find a new favorite place.",

    "text": "When it comes to Subway's the product is pretty much uniform across locations as long as they keep fresh buns and toppings on hand. Most of the difference I believe is when it comes to staff, customer service, cleanliness, and the location.\n\nI came in one day for lunch when I was between meetings and in the area. It was just starting to get busy for lunch so there was a bit of a line-up. By just starting to get busy I mean there were 2 people that just finished paying and I was next and then 2 people behind me and people were starting to come in behind those people. So by any means I wouldn't not consider that a huge line-up at all.\n\nMy main reason for giving such a low rating is purely the dysfunctional layout of the store. As you move down the line towards the till you are herded into the corner where the pop vending machine is and all of the eating utensils and essentials. So this design pushes people into a tight corner where everyone is in each others way. It is very uncomfortable to say the least. It isn't a huge store...maybe 20 seats in total perhaps. There must be a better way to lay things out to better control the flow of customers but it may take a bit of remodelling. Personally this dysfunctional layout would prevent me from coming back. It is just too awkward and uncomfortable of a location. Hopefully they can remedy this at some point. If so I may revisit and update my review.",

The bartender acknowledged me quickly and took my drink order, a lemonade. This is where it got hazy. He was so overwhelmed making drinks for all of the tables that after 15 minutes I still didn't have my drink and all he could do is keep looking down the bar every few minutes to let me know he realized I was still there. I only had an hour to eat and at this pace I just got up and left. I felt bad for the bartender because he was working hard and needed more help.

    "text": "My husband and I ate dinner with another couple on Saturday night.  Since I love Veal Parmigiana and their menu stated 'Considered by Many as \"The Best They Have Ever Had\"' I figured it was a good choice.  As soon as my entr\u00e9e came, I saw that the veal was pretty thick which isn't typical.  The first bite had a lot of fat and gristle in it...I tried again.  The second bite was also full of chewy fat and gristle.  I immediately sent it back asking the waiter to bring me the Chicken Parmigiana instead.  My fellow diners were already finished with their meals when mine came.  It was ok at best.  A manager NEVER came over which is what typically happens whenever their is an issue at a restaurant.  Then, the bill came and I was charged for the $26 VEAL parmigiana and not the $22.50 CHICKEN Parmigiana.  Very disappointing especially since I am frequent diner and fan of their sister restaurant Riviera in Medford Lakes.  I will not be dining here again",

It took 45 minutes for our appetizers to come out. The edamame was over cooked and mushy while the spring roll did not look appetizing almost like it was frozen. I could buy better spring rolls from trader joes.\nNext we moved on to our sushi which was sat on the sushi bar for 15 minutes before it was brought to us. The sushi it self was good, but not the best I have ever had,\nIf I came here again I would not buy any appetizers. The service was slow",

    "text": "We were led here by the glowing Yelp reviews and the fact that we had a wonderful meal at Mad Fish last year (owned by the same person as 1200). What a mistake.\n\nFirst off the place is tiny and extremely loud.  I ordered the sea bass, but they were out of it - at 7pm?  Next I tried to order the grouper special - again out of it.  Richard, our waiter told me (confidentially per him) that he could give me the 8 oz lobster tail for $24 along with the mashed potato side and my choice of broccoli or asparagus.  Chose the asparagus.  Chip\nOrdered the Berkshire pork chop with a pepper rub, mashed potatoes and asparagus.  My lobster was good, but no way was this tail 8 oz before cooking.  Chip's pork chop was a spectacle of gristle and fat.  Despite its huge size he probably got about a half portion due to the bad cut of meat.  His potatoes were pretty good. His asparagus were missing, but when he saw the sad little overcooked spears I received, he figured he'd pass.\n\nWhen Richard came back and asked if we wanted a box for the uneaten gristle and fat we told him it wasn't necessary and explained why.  To his credit, he apologized and removed the $15 charge for my glass of Groth Sauvignon Blanc, which we thanked him for and appreciated the gesture.\n\nWhen we got the bill I noticed that I was given an additional charge for the asparagus, even though that was not mentioned when he offered the choice of broccoli or asparagus.\n\nI should say that the house chopped salad, rolls and maple butter were delicious and that's what made me give 1200 two stars instead of one.\n\nAvoid at all costs.  Between the noise factor, lack of listed entrees at 7pm and the bs crap with the vegetable, there are many other places that deserve your tourist dollars more.",

The food is good but overpriced(ie about  35 dollars with tip for lunch for two, which basically consisted of  a  turkey sandwich each). On a recent visit for lunch, we once again had a regular waiter there who is brusque, curt and basically has no feel for customer service. When I informed the owners this last time, after experiencing this on multiple visits, they literally stared me down, and had no response at all, not even a thank you, sorry, or a willingness to look into it. Needless to say, I will not be making a return visit. I had been a fairly regular customer before, and had never complained about anything, I will also not be recommending this to friends, colleagues in the area.",

Walking in the receptionist wss very nice and sat us right away.   Unfortunately the table was so small it left me wondering how we would fit any of our plates on it.  The devote was nice and had a rustic feel.  I ordered the fish tacos with a side of rice & beans. My s/o ordered the steak or perhaps the beef tacos ( I cant remember the name). The food presentation was very nice but there was very little food which would have been ok it it was offset by big flavor.   However, the food was bland and needed salt among other spices.  I grew up near the Mexican border and know my Mexican food.  If your looking for an authentic spot or at least food with flavor... this is not it",

The food, on the other hand, will make you wish you had eaten at home. My wife and I went out as a treat because we didn't feel like cooking, but the majority of our food was sub-par. I got the shrimp po-boy which was not a po-boy by definition (it was just shrimp on a crappy sandwich...no French bread, no Cajun sauce or even enough Cajun seasoning, and the shrimp was obviously frozen-thawed not fresh). One of the shrimps was even gray when I bit into it, and the sandwich itself smelled more like old fish than fresh shrimp. My wife got the Athena chicken sandwich and that was just so-so, with the overwhelming taste of feta disguising the low-quality factory chicken they use for the sandwich. The best part of our collective meals was the mixed greens we ordered as a side, so I wouldn't exactly recommend ordering food here unless you're completely hammered and taste is not a priority.",

I've been twice, just to make sure the first time wasn't an off day for them, and because I live nearby and want to support local places, but I've yet to try anything from their menu that didn't have dry, chewy meat in it. You can get much better for the price elsewhere in Nashville. The decor is typical modern discomfort, most notably with tall metal chairs that are hell on earth for a short person to get in and out of. Service was friendly enough, but the food is what's important and so far it's lacking.",

    "text": "Inconsistent quality - pizza review only\n\nOrdering a pizza from these guys is a roll of the dice.  Sometimes it is fresh and delicious, other times it is not so fresh with regards to the dough.  Tonight we had the latter with our plain cheese pizza.  When they are using fresh dough we think the pizza tastes delicious.  For this reason they are our go-to place for pizza in the area.  On more than one occasion, though, our pizza seemed to have been made from a dough ball that had either been improperly stored resulting in the outer surface becoming hardened before it was modeled into a pie crust;  or it was just plain old and stale.  Hence the reason for this review and the two-stars.  My hope is Franco's will see this and adjust their practices to provide the freshest quality always.",

The 1/2 lb chicken platter got me 1 chicken tender and two wings (drum).  The chicken wasn't seasoned, had entirely too much coating, was bland, overcooked, dry and cold so I guess on Saturday night they arent frying up fresh chicken.\n\nI purchased an extra sauce and got Mac and cheese as the side.  The honey mustard sauce was the best ever (the reason for the two stars) the sweet chili sauce wasn't sweet??? And the Mac and cheese is more of a lasagna coated version of Mac and cheese.\n\nNeedless to say I'm disappointed for wasting $16.95 and never returning to this place.  I need my money back.",

First off, our meals were not bad. They were average.  They did however, lack flavor.  It might sound strange to say this, but our food and the space lacked identity. I feel like all Starr restaurants are known to have an identity and the food reflects that identity. This was definitely a weak point. This place was \"good\" but not what I assumed a Starr restaurant would be about.

Two major things stood out for me that I wish hadn't: my bulldog tasted so bitter even my husband wouldn't drink it, and it turns out the dry ribs were breaded even though there was no mention of breading on the menu. I tasted the lime slush on its own and it was fine, but The drink as a combo was unfortunately undrinkable due to the bitterness, and we couldn't figure out why. The bartender was nice enough to replace it with a vodka soda so it's not his fault. Most dry ribs are keto friendly and are not breaded. Our mistake for not asking, I totally get that. The ribs were very breaded, so we couldn't eat them and just packed them up and took them home. In short, the bulldog was undrinkable and the dry ribs were breaded, which like I said was probably our fault for not asking about.",

I've always stuck with the BBQ grilled chicken, steak fries and salad or the gelled chicken salad. The portion sizes are consistent & I commend them for all of that. \n\nHowever, the last few times my family and I visited the host staff has been incredibly rude - incredibly. I'm not the guy who often complains about much, but when it comes this, the host staff can really set the tone for a patron's experience. (Can you tell I was a host trainer in a past life?) The problem is each time we've been to this location the head host made it seem like we were bothering her to be seated. Last week (a weekday, around 4:45pm), when I asked for a low both the head host took a deep breath, didn't say anything and rolled her eyes. This, my friends, is NOT acceptable!\n\nOn the other hand, the service is usually pretty great!

The bartenders did not offer any education when it came to their beers and seemed like pouring me a beer was a nuisance. But nothing came close to as bad as the \"chef\" in their small kitchen. When my girlfriend asked how were the nachos he simply replied smugly \"they're chips with cheese on them\". He then gave me a beeper and since my party was upstairs I asked how long the wait would be to see if I should just wait downstairs, to which Prince Charming replied \"your food is ready when your number goes off\". Disappointing experience since I think they have the best beer in STL.",

Sat for about 5 minutes with the last party's dirty dishes on the table. Waitress finally removed the dirty dishes and brought two waters. Didn't come back for another 10 to 15 minutes to take our lunch order. Ordered the pretzel, Buffalo chicken sandwich and peel and eat shrimp (two of us). We now waited for about 15 minutes for the pretzel. An appetizer, waiting 15 minutes (and all it is was a frozen pretzel, not that hard). After receiving the pretzel and finishing it, waited another 20 minutes for our food. 20 minutes for a sandwich and a few shrimp (which literally requires placing them on a plate). About 4 tables that were sat around us at the same time or AFTER we did received their food before we did. I stopped the waitress who kept just walking by and asked what was taking so long. She so stupidly said, \"I'll go check, not sure what's taking so long.\" Food still didn't come out for another 10 minutes. Peel and eat shrimp were fine. (They weren't for me). Chicken sandwich was disgusting. So much grease, it poured in my mouth the first (and only) bite. The batter was undercooked and just falling off the chicken. It was as if it was battered too much and just soaked in under temperature oil. Asked the waitress to send over the manager. This is a key point here. The manager acted dumber than the waitress. Literally seemed extremely unintelligent. Stuttering and mumbling, uhhh, ummm, not really sure. At one point he actually said, \"uhhh, well it is a fried chicken sandwich.\" I mean really. This is your manager? This is your best guy on the floor? Shameful. After mumbling he said, \"I'll take care of this for you\" and walked away. Never to return. We sat there like idiots for the next 10 minutes without  the waitress or manager telling us we didn't have to pay. This was the worst restaurant experience I've had in recent memory. I will not return and I will not recommend anyone go here.",

Unfortunately, I just didn't enjoy this restaurant and was pretty disappointed.\n\nLee How Fook is pretty small, but that didn't make it lose any points in my book.  I could see it getting really busy (especially since there are only about 10 tables available), so I would definitely suggest making reservations if you're going on a weekend.  The service wasn't bad, but when I asked some questions about some dishes on the menu, I had a hard time understanding what she was trying to say.  \n\nOkay now to the main course - food!  For appetizers, we ordered the pan seared pork dumplings and sui mai.  Both appetizers were delicious and the dipping sauce was really good.  For the entrees, we ordered the sweet & sour chicken, pan fried noodle with shrimp, and pan fried noodle with beef and black bean sauce.  The sweet & sour chicken was awful - more sweet than sour - and the vegetables in it were really undercooked (pretty much raw).  (I do have to admit that I like things spicy, so maybe this dish just wasn't for me.)  For both pan fried noodle dishes, they were blah with a side of blah.  The beef dish was supposed to be spicy, but I just didn't taste any heat.  I left here full, but unsatisfied.",

Being one of the very few restaurants that open late nearby Penn's campus, Axis is a solid choice. Even better, they open AND deliver 24/7.\n\nHowever, don't expect much from the quality of their food. My friends and I ordered a medium pizza and an order of mozzarella sticks. The pizza was bland and all the topping fells off after taking the slice. The mozzarella sticks were hard and cheese definitely did not melt in your mouth as you would expect them to. \n\nDespite this, Axis is such a great option, or probably the only option that actually delivers late nights!

The bad news is that I was very disappointed in my burger.  I ordered the Ramsey and, after cutting it in half, took a bite.  After a second bite, there was no more meat on that half.  Literally, two bites and done.  The second half made it through three bites.  This patty must have been the size of a breakfast sausage patty.  The bun was VERY deceiving in that it was 2-3 times larger than the \"burger\".  This was more like a slider than a full-sized burger.  I was quite disappointed.  It's a shame too because the bar looked like it had some great choices.  I won't be going back",

MEDIUM = PINK in the center.  Look it up.  Seriously.  Oh and they have no fries or chips.  Really am I being too traditional in expecting this?  They brought me out mashed potatoes in lieu of the coleslaw (I avoid mayo based dishes in principle), and the mashed were pretty good but not what I wanted with a burger.

As soon as I sat down the woman next to me warned me against ordering anything with grilled chicken in it. She motioned towards her uneaten salad and said she couldn't cut it with a knife. Five minutes after I sat down one of the servers was greeting the table right  behind me just as they were sitting down. When she was finished I flagged her down and told her I'd been sitting here for five minutes and no one waited on me. She apologized and said it was Tom's section but that she'd take care of me. I ordered the penne Roma (no peas or mushrooms) and a water. Everything went just fine after that and the pasta was about the same as it would have been at any pasta house restaurant.

I get it, working with friends is fun but when there's customers waiting for food, especially simple orders, it needs to be taken care of. Not to mention they brought the wrong thing out, and when I corrected them, I still waited several more minutes for ice cream in a cup.

I've worked in tons of restaurants before and if it was up to me I'd implement some serious re-training, especially based on similar reviews.",

Unfortunately, this was the case for the Pancake Pantry.  I am a pancake connoisseur and I can usually tell a good pancake by  looking at it. Yes, I'm that good.  One look at these pancakes and I had their number. They were fluffy and doughy, much like the ones at McDonald's or any number of short order diners in the country.  I personally like my pancakes with a light crisp edge, which usually means they have been cooked in butter, and they should be tasty before any butter or syrup is added. Not true of the Pancake Pantry. Just ok. Milquetoast even.  Good bacon though.",

The Margarita's were very light on the mix - and very watery, but that's probably expected since they use crushed ice and not a real restaurant grade margarita machine. If you like Margarita's, skip this one.

Perhaps she had a bad day or night before, not sure. She was rude and everything we asked for she seemed to come back with an attitude. We all saw it.

When we finally got our check, I noticed an 18% gratuity added.  Now, the checks at this place consist of a calculator tape and that is it.  You would never know how much anything costs by looking at your check.  The 18% gratuity was added inconspicuously after I gave her the certificate.  My party consisted of 4 people, myself, my husband, and our 2 children under 4 years old.  I couldn't believe a tip was added to our check.  My husband had dined her before, and there was no tip added, so clearly it was not a restaurant policy, it was at the waitresses discretion.  Also, there was a sign outside of the restaurant when we walked in that stated that fajitas were the daily special at $6.99.  On our check, there was nothing for that price, so when I questioned the waitress, she said that was a lunch special only.  THEN TAKE THE SIGN DOWN!!  I will not be back to this restaurant based on service alone, but on top of that, the food was only average...try Dos Margaritas in Hendersonville, much better service and much better prices!!",

    "text": "THE GOOD: great food for a decent price.  We got the $65 oyster platter which came with 12 huge and succulent oysters, about a dozen each of clams and mussels, 10-12 tails of jumbo shrimp, about half of a huge king crab, 2 small sauce cups of ceviche, and 3 different sauces including a malt vinegar, cocktail sauce, and a spicy mayonnaise dipping sauce, as well as multiple wedges of lemon.  The platter was huge and probably could have fed 3-4 people, though I was able to eat most of it with some help from the fiancee.  The oysters were fresh and delicious and were the star of the platter, while the crab was the not seasoned and somewhat bland compared to the rest of the platter.  Of note, I liked the shrimp as they were steamed with a spicy cajun seasoning which was a nice Louisiana touch.\n\nWe also ordered the fried oyster, bacon, romaine lettuce, and avocado salad which was decent.  The fried oysters on the salad were perfectly prepared, though the bacon was thick cut and a bit on the tough/chewy side (i prefer bacon in a salad to be crispy).\n\nTHE BAD: Service was horrible.  I think we got the worst server in the restaurant; here's the breakdown: His appearance--his long hair made me think he should have been in an 80's hair metal band instead of serving in a moderately upscale seafood restaurant.  His service--inattentive: 1. he never introduced himself before taking our order, 2. he didn't allow us to finish our order as after we ordered our oyster platter he took our menus and walked away and I had to get another waiter/server to order a salad that we wanted to come with our oyster platter, 3.  He forgot our bread, and we didn't realize we were supposed to get bread until halfway through our meal when we saw other tables getting bread, 4. We asked him for lemon with our water and he forgot after multiple queries, and we actually asked 3 different waiter/waitresses/servers for lemon and they all forgot, though our main waiter eventually remembered and brought the lemon to us in the middle of our meal.  The final straw in this terrible haystack was his apathy and rude demeanor at the end of our meal--after taking my credit card and charging for the meal, he walked by our table and threw the credit card/receipt pad so that it plopped on our table and said \"here you go\" and continued walking away like he didn't care.  Overall, it seemed like he did not really care for his job and was there just going through the motions.  I was surprised that a restaurant of Luke's stature hired a waiter like this, as with an appropriate waiter and appropriate service, this meal would have been phenomenal.  Unfortuntely, the service left us in a sour mood despite the quality of the food.  If the service would have matched the food, Luke would have deserved a 4 or 5 stars in my mind, but because of the poor service we received, I gave the restaurant 2/5 stars.",

    "text": "I wanted to like this place!!  I live less than a mile away, and for months I've watched the construction with anticipation. When I heard it was a Blake's, I researched them on the interwebs and got even more excited. I was *so* excited, in fact, that on opening day, I arrived before they opened and was the third person in drive-thru. (on a side note, the trash folks arrived right after me, and couldn't get to the dumpster, so we all had to move out of their way, let them do their job, then go back in place.)\n\nFor this \"getting to know you\" phase, I ordered a bacon breakfast burrito, a Southwest burrito with red sauce, and a Lotaburger with no add-ins. Despite being the third person in drive-thru, it took quite a bit to get my food, but I figured it was due to just opening. I took the food home and cut it in half so my teenager and I could try it all. The bacon burrito was...just okay. The hash browns were a big white mush and the green chiles were too hot for me. I had to pick them out. Teenager agreed, except the chiles were fine for him. I took one bite of the Southwest burrito and actually yelped. My mouth was instantly on fire! They should warn people about the red chile sauce because it was way WAY too hot. My lips and tongue were throbbing, and I couldn't eat any more of it. Teenager liked the burrito, except he said it was too small for the price. The Lotaburger (thankfully, I didn't put chiles on it!) was just okay. It was like a poor hybrid of a Whataburger and an In-N-Out burger, and neither of us were overly impressed.  So...overall, my impressions were \"just okay, but the chiles were too hot\" while teenager thought it was \"just okay, but too many onions used.\"\n\nA week later, we gave it another shot. We arrived late in the afternoon, and were smart enough to park in the adjoining church parking lot, right behind the bus stop. Interestingly, there weren't any people in line to order, but there were many people waiting for food.\n\nThis time, we ordered chicken strips, the grilled chicken sandwich, regular fries, seasoned fries and onion rings to go. It took FOREVER to get our food! For most of our wait, there were several other people waiting for their food, and one of the crew members kept telling us to move out of the way. (Here's a tip...if too many people are in the way..maybe get the food out faster?) The kitchen was full of people, so I don't know what the deal was with getting food out.\n\nAnyway, our order FINALLY arrived and we took it home. Like before, we divided everything in half so we could sample it all.  Once again, the food was just okay. The chicken strips seemed small, and were nothing special. The bun on the grilled chicken sandwich was a sodden mess because of the mayo-like sauce they used. It fell apart quickly and both of us wound up just eating the grilled chicken and leaving the rest of the sandwich. The fries were  just okay...nothing special. The seasoned fries weren't very seasoned, and the onion rings were decent but too greasy.\n\nSo, to recap, in our two visits we tried:\n\na Lotaburger\na bacon breakfast burrito\na southwest breakfast burrito\na chicken sandwich\nchicken strips\nfrench fries\nseasoned fries\nonion rings\n\nThe overwhelming result: nothing outright sucked (except for that wet bun), but none of it was really good. It was just one big MEH. Add the intolerable wait, and this is one place we won't be revisiting anytime soon.\n\nI'm so disappointed.\n\nps...my mom texted this morning, and said she was the second person in drive thru at 6:21am, and she didn't get her food until 6:39am. She, too, said the burrito was just okay, and she'd not planning to go back either.",

    "text": "We've tried quite a few sushi places in the West and South County areas. All of the food we had was very good here--nice, complex flavors. All of their rolls were comparably priced to other places. If you want to fill up and not spend way too much, get quite a few of their hand rolls and veggie rolls ($4).\n\nHowever, we were at the restaurant for 1:30 hours. We didn't get our food for well over an hour and ate it pretty quickly after being so hungry. There were four total couples in the restaurant and a couple of carry-out orders being worked on. It looked as though there was only one chef present and everyone's meals were coming out very slowly. After finishing, we were ignored. The waitress was all around us doing other things: cleaning tables, checking on other people, etc. It  was quite obvious that we were finished for quite some time. The manager came by early on and apologized for the long wait.\n\nBefore anyone dismisses this as me being hard to please, that's far from the truth. I always give people the benefit of the doubt and never complain about meals or ask to see managers (and I didn't do that this time either). I eat it even if it's bad, still tip appropriately for less than good service, and go on my way.\n\nThe whole point of this is: If the service was bad, I could possibly see around it and return. If the food was slow, same thing...but not both! If I'm looking for a variety of rolls and a decent place to eat them, there are other options out there.",

Asked 1 waitress what it could be and her response was \"it's from the wine sitting to long\" which was the dumbest thing I've ever heard I proceeded to ask our actual waitress what it could be from and she replied with \" it's probably from the ice we used to chill it\" however it looked like oil not water.

Sadly, not only were we not impressed with the food but we actually left hungry. I am not one to complain over the price of food or the portions if the food is exceptionally good. I've had very small portions of things that left me dreaming about it and wanting more and I will go back to those places to get it again. But this was not one of those experiences. We ordered a local seasonal picked vegetable plate with a rabbit pate. All the pickled veggies tasted the same, the rabbit was not that good. Very under seasoned and bland. We also had the onion and goat cheese tart with was literally the size of a round hostess snack cake. Super small. Ironically that was the only good thing we ate there. Next came our entree, which the waitress said would feed 2. It was 1, I repeat,  1 big ravioli with ricotta and egg in the middle over an oxtail ragu. The ravioli was under seasoned, the oxtail was over done and a bit tough and the sauce was one dimensional. It needed acidity or some heat. It's a cool looking restaurant with so much potential but just because you serve food and label it \"local\" or \"artisanal\" does not make it good. In my opinion this food is bland, pretentious, over priced and the portions are so tiny you will need to eat again directly after leaving. I wouldn't go back again.",

    "text": "Finally dined in for the sushi buffet on Tuesdays. The first time I went it was ok service. The waiter didn't fill up my water until I pointed it out. However, the second and most recent time I went, I was sorely disappointed. While the sushi buffet is still a good deal, it honestly isn't worth me trekking out again. The manager has since my last visit started enforcing a no sharing rule. I inquired if we could just swap one sushi out with each other since we were both getting the sushi buffet. The waiter resolutely said no.  While he and the other waitress were polite enough when bringing our food and taking our orders, I could do without the slow service. We waited close to 30 minutes for our first set of rolls - and they chalked up the slowness due to needing to \"fry\" the tobiko. There were maybe at most 4 other tables besides us there. I could also overhear the waiter speaking in Chinese that I was \"pushing\" and \"rushing\" for the food to be done. I mentioned it once - well past the 25 minute mark. Sorry but frankly, there shouldn't be a 30 minute wait for a single set of rolls. I would've overlooked it but it happened consistently with each set of rolls that there was a long wait. I would postulate that it's a technique they use to discourage you from ordering more sushi. Regardless, I've had better sushi buffets in the DC area for cheaper, better service, and better atmosphere. In a city as large as Philly, I'm sure there are other sushi buffets to eat at. While this was my go to for take out and sushi buffets previously, I can safely say I am unlikely to return or order after my last trip. Other sushi buffets I've gone to don't require me to order off the menu and for me to finish each piece before getting more - and don't stipulate that I can't share among other people who have opted to get the sushi buffet too.",

I told my partner it can't be any worse than the other mediocre places we have been going. I was wrong.\nThe take out service was fast for a Sat night. We were there within 20 minutes of ordering and it was ready. But the dining room was empty. For a Sat night that should have been a big clue. The rest of the places in the neighborhood were busy.\nThe steamed dumplings could have been great. The tasted homemade and the filling was good. However, they were so doughy with a really thick wrapper too thick that it detracted from the good filling. Everything else went downhill from there. \nThe beef and broccoli was inedible. The beef had an awful weird texture. Like it was boiled and was gelatinous.  The sauce on it had off flavors. We literally scraped it off our plates and threw the whole thing out.  The meat in both the general Tao's chicken and the orange beef also had weird textures. It was mushy and the coating was thick on those as well. The flavors in the sauces would have been fine, but they were gloopy.  The fried rice was fair but nothing memorable.\nWe won't be going back.",

This would not normally be an issue but it was a cold night and the waitresses kept holding the doors open to talk with the people outside allowing all the cold air and smoke to flow to our table.\nAs for the food it was mediocre. My wife ordered wings and informed me that they were nothing special. I ordered a chicken quesadilla and it was awful. It was just plain unseasoned chicken with cheese, definitely not worth $8. However, the drinks were strong which was surprising.\nThe service was not great either. Our waitress, Deborah, was unfriendly and not very attentive often passing us by multiple times without noticing our drinks were gone.

My pork was pounded thin and cooked well. It was pretty tender, the panko crust was golden and crispy but could have used a bit of flavor. The wild mushroom ragout was a little lack luster. It tasted heavily of sherry, but had almost nothing else going for it besides a heap full of really amazing wild mushrooms (which was redeeming). The fries are shoestring and thin, and really tasty when they're piping hot, but stale quickly and then get kind of hard and yucky. My friend had the shrimp and grits, which was good, but overly rich even for a typically overly rich dish. We had a beyond amazing meal the next day at Commander's for the same price. Wouldn't do it again. I do, however, hear that their happy hour is great! Good oysters, their raw bar seemed on point.",

Then I got a strawberry margarita which was HUGE, and the most expensive margarita I've ever had. My friends margarita was $12, mine was $16, but I did not ask for premium liquor, although I think the waiter charged me for it! Also I was in town from Chicago, my first time in NOLA, and after hearing this, the waiter told me not to mind the rats and cockroaches! At dinner! Come on.... you can do better...",

    "text": "My friend wanted to meet for dinner and she loves Mexican. I arrived first, I was shocked at how noisy it was inside, of course sitting outside was not an option. It took us a bit to get someone to bring us menus. When we finally got them, a man appeared and literally threw the salsa bowl on the table at us. My friend and I both were startled and shocked. At this point I am afraid to order. My friend said she had been in the place many times and she had never been treated like this. Finally, a decent server came to our rescue. I got the frozen margarita, less chance of them spitting in it, plus I figured the more than I drank the better this experience would become. My friend ordered the steak fajita's and I got the soft chicken tacos. It was your typical Mexican fare. It took forever to get our tab. Not a pleasant Sunday night experience.",

This was across the street from where I got gas for my rental car so I decided to get a to go order.  I ordered the fried crawfish, seafood gumbo, pecan pie and bread pudding.  I didn't love any of it, it was just mediocre.  The crawfish weren't seasoned they tasted like I could probably get them in the freezer section at the grocery store.  My pecan pie was just OK nothing about it made me want to have another slice.  I was very disappointed with the bread pudding; it was cold with a huge chunk of icing on the top.  Perhaps that is their standard practice to give it to people when they are getting to go orders, but they should at least ask if you would like it warmed up because I was heading to the airport.  Since it was cold I didn't eat it because I couldn't enjoy the way a proper bread pudding is supposed to be.",

We visited on a Saturday afternoon around 5:00 and the place was only 1/3 full. Took a while for our server to greet us, arrived just when we were about to get up and leave. Ordered a beer for each of us and waited at least 10 minutes before I finally got up to ask the bartender about our drinks (after watching him not making any drinks for several minutes and serving a few others who just arrived at the bar). I could barely get the words out before he says they'll be right up. I sit back down, and he still doesn't pour them. We were about to leave again when another bartender made eye contact and she poured the drinks and brought them to us. While our waitress was friendly, she should have been checking on our drinks. Same slow experience with the other two visits, this time we are certain we will not be back.",

I would describe them as \"three flour tortillas with a tiny bit of fish, a little bit of cabbage, topped with three kernels of corn.\" They didn't come with any sides either - if I hadn't gotten fries as well I would have left hungry. The fries are okay - just standard, straight cut fries. Can't complain.\n\nMy husband got a burger which was a little overcooked and overall, pretty standard.

This was chicken broth, coconut milk and sugar with a trace of red chili paste.)\n\nThe Won Ton soup was extremely salty and the won tons were poorly made.   They were not a nice soft noodle, they were gummy and pasty.\n\nThe fried rice had no flavor.  \n\nSo I have to agree with Rina's review:  For what is offered here, one would be just as well to order carry out from a corner generic Chinese-in-a-box purveyor.\n\nThere is a star given for cleanliness and a star for pleasant service.\n\nNo reason we would return.",

    "text": "SAVE YOUR MONEY AND YOUR TIME\n\nI heard that this place had the best burger in St. Louis - not true.  In fact, most of the menu wasn't that appealing as almost everything is topped with provel cheese - If you've ever been outside of St. Louis, you'll realize this isn't a real cheese - more importantly it tastes like melted plastic.  \n\nAside from that, I went there with my fiance on Saturday night around 7:00 pm.  We waited 15 minutes to receive our first drinks and it went downhill from there.  We were there more than an hour before our burgers were served to us.  The manager was nice enough to apologize and give us each a complimentary drink (which is the only reason I gave two stars instead of one), but that didn't make up for the lackluster burgers - way too heavy on the cheese, grease and butter and way too lacking on flavor.  This place is definitely not worth the hype - the food is not worth the incredibly long wait (our only explanation is that they weren't \"used to having the patio open and it [was] a really busy night\".  Well, if you have a restaurant with a patio, then you should be able to accommodate people in a timely manner. \n\nGreasy burger, extremely greasy fries, slow service.....and all for the low cost of $44 dollars (with the $5 tip we left).  Save your money and go to McD's where you can get a consistently good Big Mac that TRUMPS the hell out of the burgers at Joey B's",

Ageism at its finest! In the end, my wife and I and the old couple walked away with relatively the same experience though because the food was awful. Don't order fish.

Large overlooked dry as f turkey that you had to choke down with 8 glasses of Sprite? Bingo. Rumfish Grill.

We asked the waitress if there was a way to just to put half bill on one card and half on another card since could not split checks and would not give us separate checks. She said no. I asked if there was an ATM on site to get money out and she said no. Finally she said she would just have to put our orders on different tables so that we can have separate checks. There was also a note put on the menu about extra chips being extra which I found odd as I have never seen that at a Mexican restaurant before. I could understand the split checks rule on a busy night with large parties but the fact they were giving us a hard time when we were once again the only people in the restaurant.

    "text": "This strip mall restaurant really confuses me. The inside is relatively small but clean and well kept. There was also outside seating available which is nice. On a Sunday afternoon there were about 6 tables occupied with 2 tables that were occupied by Hispanic people which is usually a good sign. My son and I were seated quickly and chips and salsa brought to the table. Tri-color chips? Really? The salsa was smooth and tomatoey. Drinks were brought out timely. On a Sunday early afternoon, 1 TV was on American football, 1 on European football (soccer), 1 on CNN and 2 on a camping show. The menu is huge. Too many choices.\n\nI ordered their signature cilantro cream enchiladas and my son order the Monterey Quesadilla. The food came out fast. I mean unexpectedly fast. The quesadilla was rolled which I hadn't before and appeared to be heated on a flattop but it came out way to quick. My son said it was good. The cilantro cream enchiladas were just 2 small tortillas rolled with only precooked chicken chunks, no binders. Every time I cut the tortilla the chicken chunks pour out. The cream sauce was good but needed more cilantro. The enchiladas came with rice and black beans. The rice was pretty standard overcooked and dry. The black beans came in a tortilla cup and they had no flavor. They didn't even taste like beans. They had NO flavor. They were very confusing and I left them behind.\n\nAll-in-all, there must be something tasty on the menu with so many 4 and 5 stars but I didn't find it and I am not planning to go back and try to find out.",

I went in on a Tuesday night around 815 to get takeout, and they made me feel like I was interrupting clean up time. I wasn't greeted by anyone, even though there were 4 guys behind the line and a girl sweeping the dining room floor. \n\nEven as I approached the register, the girl put her broom down, went behind the line, and just looked at me. Not a hello, how are you, or what would you like. \n\nTo further this point, two ladies came in after me and were told that the food they wanted would take over 10 minutes to cook. But the tone was what was telling. It was said in a way that was clear they didn't want to be bothered and should go elsewhere for food. \n\nI can get good Mediterranean food just about anywhere in town. It is the little things that will keep me coming back. Feeling as though I inconvenienced you by eating at your restaurant is a definite way to ensure I wont be back.\n\n\nUPDATE 1/5: The GM emailed me and asked for my phone # and then called me shortly there after. He was very apologetic and asked me to come back in and give them another try. I will do so because of the way they handled this. Kudos to Jose",

Huge margarita-good for 2 or 3!  Not a must come here kind of a place for me but would try it again.  Maybe  it was an off day.

    "text": "Summary: Their special for the night was the best part. Not a great location or space to have a fancy dinner or throw a big party. I would probably go with family or friends again just because it was the first family owned Italian restaurant of the united states, but besides that I do not really find it overall that special. Too pricey. \n\nFood: \nAppetizers: Escargots Au gratin ($8.50) The escargots were really large for its size, it was tasty but could be because it was literally all butter. I still enjoyed it, but it could be better if it was less buttery.\n\nEntree: Chicken Parmigiana ($17.00) My opinion is it is a bit too pricey for such a common dish. However, it was a bit crunchier than other chicken parm that I have had.  Besides that I did not find it any special and definitely not worth its price. \n\nBlack Lobsters Raviolis ($20.00) This dish was one of their specials for the night, not on their menus.  It was tasty, but a little too salty and buttery.  It comes with jumbo shrimps and capers.  The dish looks small, but very filling.\n\nPlace: \nLocation: It is within a residential area, about two (or more) blocks away from South St (Main commercial area). I took a cab there and back (cost about $20). Not easy access. Residential area also means hard to find parking.\n\nEnvironment: The place has tinted windows, so we cannot see from outside.  The moment you walk in you basically see the whole place, very small.  The tables are cramped on top of each other. I went there on a Tues night, and there was a lot of elders, probably not a young hip place. \n\nPrice: I think the overall pricing is too high.  Two people: 1 appetizer, 2 entree and some fountain drinks came out to be around $60 (with tip).",

    "text": "Let's start off with the positives, great piano bar great selection of wines and lot's of outside seating. Very friendly staff and bartenders are very attentive to the guests at their rail.\nMoving on...Parking in the area is a challenge small streets don't help either. I understand it is something out of there control but when developing a restaurant your seating calculator is based on parking spots available. This will let you use areas more productively and efficiently. Also it is very confusing where the front door is or where guests are to come in. The signs in the back just make things more confusing. We would have enjoyed sitting outside the weather was not too bad but with properly placed fire pits you could take advantage of all your patio seating.\nOn to the menu, limited but great because of the size of the establishment and very well priced. The selections were good and diverse which is key to satisfying a variety of palettes but...if you offer small a menu everything that comes out should be perfectly cooked and should taste as good as it looks. I had the pork chop unfortunately it was cooked to a med rare. I do like my pork medium but rare is wrong. My wife had the salmon which looked slightly overcooked but she was fine with it. My friend had the bone in rib eye which was cooked well but as far as taste you can tell it was choice grade and lacked a beefy flavor many look for when ordering that cut. His wife had the tilapia and she did not eat it at all! The breading was soggy and tasteless and was non-visually appealing. Too many bland colors on the menu plate presentation is everything! If it looks good it taste good! \nAlso we noticed the menu doesn't offer a description of your sides which this technique is usually used in ala carte menus. I am sure your mashed potatoes are a staple to your menu, but it's important for your chef to check potatoes often through the night because they will brown and become gummy if not maintained right as mine were no good. All of us who received the side of vegi's we received cold and very wilted and over cooked. \nThe last item is we never saw a managers presence we had a food issue and no one came to our table to follow up with us. There was also a table that had children running and screaming which causes safety issues for your staff and the children. If the food runner's were taking food and one of the kids tripped or ran into the runner and hot food were to fall on them or one of the guests it would have been serious.",

I continue to go there for a lunch about once a week because I like the salads despite the prices, noise, crowd, and the amount of time it takes to make food.  It's fresh and generally they really try to get your food as quickly as possible.  I just went to pick up lunch to eat back at work - I watched a worker prepare my salad and didn't see her include any cheese.  I looked closer as she packed it up and even asked \"Excuse me, I'm sorry, is there cheese in this?\" to which she indignantly muttered 'YES.\"  I took her word for it - must've missed her add it.  I pay $10 for my salad, drive back to work, AND THERE'S NO CHEESE ON MY SALAD.  If you have a few hours to kill and don't mind hovering about your food to make sure it's prepared correctly, HoneyGrow is great.  Unfortunately, this is the last straw with them.  I'm so disappointed.  Sweet Greens it is.",

Apparently it has come under new ownership since then - and not for the better.\n\nMy friends and I had come in during the last week of June for the first time since the move/owner change. There was quite a bit of America decoration, but it didn't really phase us, as it was entirely seasonally appropriate. However, we knew there was something a little creepy going on when we came back at Christmas and it was all still there. The whole place screams \"'MURRRICA!!!'\" a little too loudly. Plus, they pepper the waiting area with Christian paraphernalia. I love that we have a free country where you can garishly display your religious preferences however you like,  but at the end of the day it can turn people off. \n\nThat aside, it was a little overpriced for what you get, which is basic-ass breakfast food. Besides the Patriotism being shoved down your throat with every bite, the restaurant is housed in an old dance studio, so the atmosphere is a little off. The service is slow and forgettable. The owner's snotty replies to the criticism below honestly make me never want to go back.\n\n2-stars for their awesome home fries and Elvis-themed bathroom, though!",

    "text": "I was planning to attend the boxing match on Saturday, July 29.  I received an e-mail promising a 20% discount if I bought the ticket by a certain deadline (which has not yet expired).  I could not find a place on the website to enter the promo code, so I called the phone number provided.   After going through the automated system, I got a human, who shuffled me off to another, and she said that I would have to use the promo code in person.  Well, I live in Scottsdale, and I am not going to travel to Tucson without knowing I have a ticket, so what do I do?  She said I would have to ask for the promo when I got there.  I see one of three possibilities about the promo code:  (1) scam; (2) antiquated ticket system not yet ready for the Internet; or (3) uniformed staff that cannot answer a simple question on where to type the promo code.",

I believe a lot of food is pre-cooked earlier that day, then microwaved and served. I think the Burgers are cooked fresh though. Just fyi, to any of the previous posters or whomever reads this review. This Applebees on Castor is the training/eval center. I havent really had a problem with the actual service here.

    "text": "I'm always getting menus from Chinese restaurants and pizzerias, but when you have your standbys, it's not easy for a new place to catch your eye. The menu for Queen came this week, and I wanted to try a few things from their rather large vegetarian selection. They have the usual veggie and bean curd (a.k.a. tofu) entrees, but they also have mock chicken, beef, and duck. We actually ordered carryout the same day I read the menu - I was excited!\n\nThe food was okay, but I have to admit, it was disappointing. Part of me wants to try another few dishes, but that part is being told to quiet down and not be so charitable. \n\nFirst up - moo shu vegetables. I usually love the cabbage and sweet sauce, and this had the bonus of including broccoli, baby corn, and mushrooms. But the pancakes were dry, stuck together, and inedible. The corn tasted like a can. Not great.\n\nNext, vegetarian \"beef\" with mixed vegetables. The beef tasted like my homemade attempts at seitan, where the stuff still tastes like flour. The sauce was good, but the dish was unremarkable. \n\nFinally, we ordered one of the Chef's Specialties - bean curd with general tso's sauce. The silken tofu was deep fried and coated with a sticky, sugary sauce, and there were a few pieces of broccoli alongside. Very disappointing - no spice, no heat, and just sugar and fat for appeal. \n\nThe two star rating means I've had better. My absolute favorite is Wild Ginger in Huntingdon Valley, and I also prefer China Garden Inn in Willow Grove. I was hoping for a good take out place closer to home, but this isn't it.",

Unfortunately the food falls very much short of being mediocre.\n\nWe attended with a small birthday party and they seated us in a very secluded and private spot so the beginning of the evening started off great.\n\nThe server and staff were all extremely courteous and professional.\n\nThe menu is fantastic with a fine selection of sandwiches, pastas and American fare.  They even have a nice adult beverage selection.\n\nI got the burger which was great but the entire rest of the family was very dissatisfied with their meal.\n\nThe chicken marsala is almost laughable.  The sauce has zero (that's ZERO) marsala taste and should be called \"gravy topped chicken\" and the salt is overwhelming.\n\nWe ordered a side of Kale and it was left untouched after the first taste.\n\nAll 3 people who ordered the meatloaf found the \"special hot sauce\" to be complete uncharacteristic and simply bad tasting.\n\nFor a disclaimer - my family likes to eat and rarely have a complaint about a meal so to hear so many complaints really emphasized how bad the food was.\n\nAfter a complaint the manager came and talked to us and was very understanding and unassuming but could only offer us free desserts.  We took them up on it but even the desserts were bad (no I wasn't having a bad day - the restaurant was).  The brownie was brick hard and stuck to the pan it was baked in.  The cookie was hard and tasteless (they should take some salt out of the marsala and use it in their cookie recipe).\n\nUltimately the desserts showed up on our tickets but rather than cause more of a scene we paid the bill and left.  \n\nThe Good:  The scenery, Great Staff, Great Menu Selection\nThe Bad: Speed of service\nThe Ugly:  Food",

    "text": "So I, like most people, stumbled in due to the lore of the show. Actually, we made a trip across town to stumble in, but regardless, we made it. Yes, it is just a sports bar, and there isn't much hype or dazzle, but we were expecting a LITTLE bit better in the service department. We waited over 10 minutes (yes, I was timing) for someone to even acknowledge my girlfriend and I, then another 5 before our draught beers were brought out. After that, we had a couple friends join us and our server had practically disappeared. We had to flag down another server multiple times to place another drink order, which I figured would be getting shoveled our way. \n\nOne thing that really struck me as odd was one of my friends ordered a whiskey on the rocks. 6 bucks, not bad... until we saw there was an addt'l charge of 1.50 for \"rocks\". Yes, seriously. A buck fifty for ice. Now, I know this is Philadelphia and it's my first time to the north east, but crap like that makes it want to be my last. On top of all of that, our server (who wasn't around, and it shows) actually gave us someone else's drinks on our table's bill. Had it not been for the keen eye of one of our friends, we would have started a nice date we didn't intend to finish.\n\nThe food was mediocre. The breading on the calamari was thick, almost like nothing I've had on seafood before. The wings were good, standard bar wings. That's it for food.\n\nOverall, it was about a 2.5, but closer to the 2 stars rating. I'll probably give it another go if I'm back in town and see if the service has picked up at all.",

    "text": "I've been to plenty of Panera's, and I'm usually a fan.  Tasty sandwiches and decent coffee.  Usually...\n\nI went for breakfast and ordered a sandwich and iced coffee.  The avocado, egg white, and spinach sandwich was fine.  Nothing to comment there.  Coffee was a different story.  First off, I was given a paper cup.  I did a double-take and thought maybe she heard me say 'hot coffee' instead.  I checked the receipt and it did indeed say 'iced coffee.'  That's fine, no biggie.  I got a little bit of ice and filled up with iced coffee.  I took and sip and thought I was drinking water mildly flavored with coffee.  I thought maybe I added too much ice, though in retrospect, not enough time had elapsed for much melting to occur.  I poured it out and filled up with just the iced coffee.  Same thing.  Okay, maybe that's why I was given a paper cup - because I was going to be forced to go with hot coffee instead.\n\nMost Panera's I've been do have a nice spread of coffee.  This one had decaf, light roast, dark roast, and hazelnut.  Not a great selection, but it would do.  I went with hazelnut.  Nothing...  Fine, I went with the dark roast.  I found a worker to report the two issues - iced coffee that tasted like water and hazelnut coffee being out.  Five minutes later, on my way out, I noticed that there was a sign on the hazelnut coffee, which I imagine said it was out.  I just think for an establishment that sells coffee, you need to keep better track of how much coffee is left.  Especially during breakfast hours.",

There was absolutely NO parking. Very frustrating. Parked in someone's lot, didn't get towed. Phew!  Wa told to go to the back. Partly the fault of organizer since the room we were in held no more than 40.  I was squished and had no room to move. I was thinking Yelp had it wrong then the unthinkable happened. As I came to the buffet line, there was no food. I mean every hot plate was empty. This has never happened to me at a buffet, ever. It took a good 20 min for new food to arrive, meanwhile everyone was done eating. The food was OK and for $50 per person was overpriced. Hence the reason for 2 stars. The desserts were cookies and little brownie like things. Tasty but I was expecting more. Appetizers were tasty. Chairs were covered nicely and waitresses were nice. If not for the great acquaintances, I would had spent the $100 elsewhere. There are several people who may disagree but read all reviews.",

It would be a fake set up just to make me happy, no thank you. \n\nSooo...the bf was craving fish...and I had a hankering for oysters, he mentioned Landry's. We figured hey its 3 blocks down lets go. His first time and my last chance that I was giving...\n\nWe walked in, no hostess. She was standing in the middle of the dining room. She saw us...it was not even halfway filled...she took her sweet time to come over, grabbed menus and just asked if it was 2 of us. No \nproblem. We were seated. Our server was Emma or Emily. I dont recall, she was as sweet as can be BUT didn't know anything when I asked about oysters. I ordered them anyway against my better judgement...they tasted fishy. Not fresh!!!! I doused them in cocktail sauce. The salad \nwith the house dressing was delicious...of course had to request the garlic bread, hands down top 5 best. I ordered crabcakes and he did a sirloin with  a salmon fillet. The plates came out and she made a big emphasis on the plates being hot...they were. But my first bite was lukewarm at best. WHY THE HELL IS THE PLATE HOTTER THAN THE FOOD? my bf's was the same way. His steak was dry, salmon was undercooked and salty\n as hell. Emily asked how everything was and i answered ok. She asked if i wanted a manager, i assured her it wasnt her but no. I have this thing about sending food back. \n\nWe left tipsy tho! The captain's punch was divine as always. However at the end of the day I can't  come here for salad, bread and drinks. The food isnt fresh and clearly reheated. Its overpriced for the crap u get. I really tried.

But I'm just going to pee on the fence in the corner opposed to touching that filthy restroom. \n\nOh yeah... The Christmas lights are cute and all strung up outside. But take them down inside. It's not a college dorm room people. Management: Keep this place as classy as you can by removing them. It's just tacky. \n\nPro-tip! Sit in the back of the courtyard so you and your friends can chat without talking over the musicians. Because your voices become annoying when you're talking over the trumpet solo.",

I stood at the hostess/Please wait to be seated table and no one bothered to make eye contact with me or acknowledged me. Went to the bathroom and came back. Again no acknowledgement until the bartender asked if I needed to be seated. I had the choice of a small table sanwiched right in the middle of a bunch of tables or the bar. I chose the bar.\n\nI ordered a Paulaner and the Copa burger with Spanish fries. The Paulaner came pretty fast and was pretty tasty. It's always nice when you find a place that cleans their taplines. Too many places around here don't. The Copa burger and fries came out after a bit. The fries were smokin' hot so I ate a good portion of the burger first. The Copa burger comes with mild green chiles, Monterey Jack,  and bacon on it. The chiles were decent, as was the cheese and bacon. Unfortunately my burger, which I ordered medium well to hopefully get medium, was more like medium rare. Lots of pink and juices. I like a little juice but not that much. The fries were decent but I'm not sure they were \"award winning\". And how serving fries with little green chiles and fried onions counts as being Spanish, I don't know.\n\nThe service was ok, but not that great. It took a long time to get a second beer. It seemed like they were understaffed for how many people were there. That and/or I was getting ignored. \n\nI might come back again and see if this was just an off night. Right now I\"m thinking it might be a place to get a beer and go somewhere else for dinner.",

I would have given them 3 stars for food, 4.5 for beer and 1 for service so that's how I came up with two stars.\nFood. I ordered the Shitaki and Gouda burger with onion straws. It was lacking in mositness and flavor but it was not awful. What saved this meal were the sweet potato fries. They were killer. What killed it was the fact that the order was wrong and I got the wrong fries. The redemption was I tried the regular fries and they were also amazing. \nBeer. I chose to do the 1.75 5 ounce samplers versus the larger beers seeing as I was not sure what I would like. First sample was the raspberry cider. Very sweet, nice good flavor. Not something I could drink more than a 5 ounce sampler but would do again. I also had a Pilsner, the name slips me, it was VERY good. I am a beer wimp and I really enjoyed the flavor.\nService. YIKES. Terrible, awful bad. Appetizers never came. Beers came sporadically. Order was wrong and server threw the kitchen under the bus. I think the kitchen was not the person taking the order.... Not to mention she had an excuse for everything instead of taking the blame. It was a Sunday so it was not even crowded. \nWill I go back...for the addicting sweet potato fries and beer, sure.",

I went to the bar to eat and Fred greeted me shortly after I sat down. But that was the only \"shortly\" for the rest of my dinner. The restaurant was not at that full and half of the stools at the bar were taken. I got my beer and started looking at the menu and decided to go with the Trace Atkins catfish. I am going to go ahead and say right now that Trace does not know he lended his name to this sorry excuse for catfish. I made my selections and closed the menu, a clear signal to any waiter that an order is ready to be taken. Literally four pass by's later I let Fred know that I was ready to order. I did and the food took a little longer to come than what I had hoped but not obnoxiously long...but my beer was dry and I pushed it the edge of the counter and Fred just kept waking by. After I got his attention, he refilled my beer. Two seats down from me, same deal, another guy had to get Fred's attention to get him another beer. My food came and the portion was not small but not huge either...I had been driving for 9.hours with just a small bag of beef jerky and peanuts so I was famished. I also got the coleslaw, fries and broccoli with cheese. The coleslaw was clearly old, the fries were a tad soggy and the cheese on the broccoli was...gritty? All in all the meal was just right at average. The total bill was $23 and if it had been higher I would have possibly complained but clearly here, you get what you pay for. When I was done, once again I had to grab Fred's attention. When I got my bill, I paid and Fred was actually quick to close me out. So, he was quick to greet and quick to close out but in between he could use some help. I don't think I will be back tomorrow night as I am in town for two nights. The beer prices are reasonable though.",

Our food took 25 minutes to come out (which was OK but seemed a little long for just two burgers and some fries). To be honest, the burgers were on the bland side, though, and the portion was tiny for the price. It tasted like something I could make at home (I've got your typical college student cooking skills). Plus, I was a little confused because the menu description for my burger listed bacon jam but I didn't taste any.\n\nHere's the kicker. Nearly 30 minutes into our meal, the waiter approaches our table with two more burgers. He told us our food was here but awkwardly stuttered as he walked away after we told him he was at the wrong table. A light bulb flashed in my head and I realized that those burgers were actually the ones we ordered. We had been eating the wrong ones! The waiter knew this when he saw the food on our table and craftily walked away, trying to hide this. This place doesn't deserve 1 star because the food, although bland and overpriced, was edible. The service was decent despite the fact that we were served the wrong order. (The correct order took nearly 50 minutes to reach our table by the way....) I won't be returning.",

The staff was also quite nice.  Right there - best Chinese buffet I've ever been to!\n\nThe sushi was... what it needs to be to keep the operating cost down.  Most was meh.  The mixed tempura dumpling type thing was original, but not great.  The spicy tuna roll was... actually ok!  It had a big chunk of imitation crab (dat operating cost), and the rice was dry, but I think I snarfed down six of them and felt like I had a win for the day.\n\nThe rest of the stuff was pretty much to be expected.  There was the assortment of heavily-breaded meats in different sauces.  A non-breaded \"spicy\" chicken which wasn't bad at all.  Wonton soup (can't go wrong.)  Highlight of the day was when I stumbled upon the gyoza (pot-stickers, fried dumplings, etc) complete with good sauce.\n\nI do feel like I cheated myself by not trying the Mongolian.  Next time.  Yes, I will be back, if only to try the Mongolian and have some more fried dumplings.",

Then there was apparently a problem with our voucher and a lot of back and forth w the waitress. Finally we were told it was ok but the waitress asked us for our order again bc she never put it in once there was a problem w the voucher! \n\nEventually the food came and it was just ok. I got the curry goat. It was mostly bones (large and small) and fat sadly, though the flavor was decent. It came with fried plantains which I love but these tasted like they had been reheated or microwaved or something. My husband got the jerk chicken which was full of little splinter bones. He had to be careful w every bite. He said the flavor was good but very spicy. \n\nI thought the prices seemed high considering the quality of the food and you get served water in disposable plastic cups (yet cloth napkins...). Also, you have to go outside to get to the bathroom which is pretty inconvient when it's raining out. Must be really annoying in the winter!\n\nAnother negative... No street parking in that area.

Although the fish was pretty much spot on, the sides were Very Poor. Cajun seasoned corn on the cob seemed as though it was sitting in a luke warm pan of water for a while. No freshness what so ever. Off the plate it was room temperature and had no flavor. The Cajun fried potatoes (too many), were also of poor quality. As though they had been sitting for a good while under a weak heat lamp. Off the plate, again had cooled to almost room temperature. Now these folks are pricing these plates above twenty dollars, and the quality just isn't there. All three of these items could have been cooked at the same time. I'll pay the money, but I want the quality it commands. You can't be charging restaurant prices inside a bar. Nice wait staff.

When I open the box the spinach looked black and sure enough when I tried it, all I could taste was burnt spinach.  Another experience was a thin crust with sausage and mushroom.  Pizza had no mushroom and very little sausage.  This was after they messed up my order to begin with and I had to wait an additional 35 minutes.  The combo sandwich my husband ordered did not have italian sausage on it but polish sausage.  Trust me he would know the difference.  The pizza isn't cheap so at this point I would rather pay less for bad pizza.",

If you don't feel like driving into the city to get a Gennaros Tomatoe Pie ,Beddia ,Nomad, SLiCe or any of the other pies that have elevated our pizza game in Philly, you need to temper your expectations when you stay locally. \n\nDouble Decker supply's the Ridley Wrestling Boosters the slices they sell at each home match. Typical of most Booster slices, they are usually more to the colder side. It never tasted that bad so I thought I'd try a hot, fresh, out-of-the-oven pie at their beautiful new location in Media.\n\nThis spacious shop has two floors for you to eat your food, ice cold beer to drink there or take out and a large kitchen well staffed to handle your order. \n\nI tried the small personal pan size plain pie and the 5 hot buffalo wing sampler. Had a diet Dr Pepper to drink. \n\nThe verdict? The pizza had a light crust although it was far from crispy. More to a thicker Greek crust of which I'm not a fan. The three cheeses were ok. The sauce tasted like it came out of a can.  The wings were ok. Not horrible. Not great. I wanted them to the well side but these didn't come that way. Included was three pieces of celery and ranch dressing. \n\nReminded me of New London in Prospect Park in that the pizza was cooked in a pan and they also use a blend of cheeses.But overall I prefer New London much more. \n\nDon't think I'll be back.

Recently though the store made a bunch of changes. I usually stop on my way home from work late weekday afternoons. You can always bet there's no baskets by the doors and need to go hunt one down in one of the checkout lanes. Shopping carts are always in the parking lot running around crashing into cars on windy days with a mind of their own.  During the summer months the tomatoes in the produce area are a fruit fly breeding ground. They replaced their four self checkout lanes with four staffed express lanes, but they only open one lane during the weekday afternoon peak hours, making the wait four times longer than before. If there was another place to get groceries between the Delaware memorial bridge and woodstown I would surely shop there because anything else would be better than this acme, but there isn't any other choice.",

It has to with the shady business practices of this establishment. We come to this restaurant on a regular basis. My issue is, lately every time we come here they try to price gouge us. Most times when I order a certain menu item, they charge me the lunch price because I order a smaller portion. Depending on the day and the server, the price changes every time. Most recently I ordered only a child's cheese quesadilla, nothing else. I was charged full price for an entire kids meal. I was told when I questioned it that the \"manager\" made him charge me that way. Also on a separate occasion we were way overcharged for margaritas. This issue is now happening so frequently, that I refuse to return. Great job management, trying to get a couple more bucks just lost you loyal customers that frequent your establishment and also recommended it to friends. No more!",

I came here for lunch after reading some pretty good reviews.\n\nDecor:\nLike many of the food vendors of Reading Terminal, they presentation is not the focus.  It was still a fairly clean cooking area and everything was labeled properly.  There was nothing to really complain about regarding the decorations given the surrounding food stalls.\n\nFood:\nI ordered the beignets which are only available on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.  It was around $8 for a bunch of fried dough balls with powdered sugar sprinkled on top.  They were freshly made to order and came inside a plastic container.  The dough itself was rather dense and did not have the light and fluffy texture that I was hoping for.  They were not as good as I had hoped, but I would be willing to try the savory options in the future.\n\nService:\nThe lady who took my order was really nice, but the lines leading up to the register can be quite confusing.  With so many people walking around the market and stopping to look at the food, it was hard to tell who was waiting for food and who was just standing around.  After placing my order I was told to wait to the side, but the food took a while to come out.  Luckily, they were piping hot when I received them, which makes up for some of the wait time.\n\nOverall, the dessert options can be skipped.  I would try the gumbo and jambalaya in the future if I ever came back.",

    "text": "I had reservations for two at 6:30 and I was seated right away within two minutes. The atmosphere of this place was nice but that's where most the good stops. \n\nI honestly don't understand how this restaurant got such high reviews. Either people had low expectations or they entered here drunk from an adventure at bourbon st or Frenchmen.\n\nI ordered a river bend and it was made absolutely horrible. It tasted like medicine or as if the vodka was randomly thrown in grape juice and ass. \n\nI ordered a charcuterie board, little neck clams, oysters, Brussel sprouts, and the shrimp grits. The charcuterie board and Brussel sprouts were amAzing. The Brussel sprouts had a seared and sweet vinaigrette flavor. Even though I really prefer the charcuterie sampler at cochon butcher over the charcuterie here it was still good. It came with a rabbit pate which was wonderful.\n\nAs we waited for our clams to come out, the server came to notify us that they were out of clams (thirty minutes later btw). So we ordered a half dozen oysters instead. Those came out within five minutes. However instead of getting a half dozen oysters, we ended up receiving only five oysters on our plate. WTF?!?! We notified our server and he ended up bringing us two additional oysters which was nice, but seriously?! How does a restaurant like this hire people that don't know the basics of counting? That right there made me question the quality of the restaurant and how overhyped this was due to john besh. The oysters were shucked wonderfully but that's really all I can give them credit for.\n\nAnyways, we finished all of our appetizers and waited an incredibly long time for the shrimp and grits. After waiting too long, we canceled our order with another waitress and our server finally came out to tell us that our order was ready but he wanted to wait for us to finish our appetizers to bring out the plate. I don't know of any restaurant that would make you wait an hour for your entree but sure... When the shrimp and grits came out I was honestly disappointed. \n\nI'm sorry to say but this restaurant may be nice but it absolutely does not deserve to be a four star restaurant. If you want good prices, good taste, and service I would go to royal house instead. Otherwise Ya no..... I would never go back here again nor recommend this place to someone else... I am so sad that this place was such a disappointment. Thanks John besh. Left the place hungry. :(",

    "text": "The only reason this restaurant doesn't get at least three or even four stars is because there isn't nary a single vegetarian entree on its menu.  In a nation with an out-of-control obesity epidemic, not to mention heart disease and diabetes being major killers, what large restaurant these days doesn't have a single darn healthy entree from which its customers can choose?  Mind you, what also adds insult to injury is that this is a hotel restaurant, so many of its patrons are stuck here (and stuck here, indeed- what other options are surrounded by this hotel, the Radisson @ Opryland?  Shoney's, Bob Evans, McDonalds, and a seafood restaurant across the street.  That's it.).  \n\nWhat saves this place from only 1 star is that the night I was there, the chef on duty that night was *very* nice at coming out and making a special pasta entree for me (which was delish), though again, why don't the owners of this place just create a veggie burger option for lunch & a healthy vegetarian entree for dinner?  Even the sides are very carb- and fake-cheez heavy, and the salads, well, guess what?  All have meat as their centerpiece.  \n\nP.S.- Am only saying 'no' for kids, because, news flash- kids are getting stuffed like prize turkeys in this country, too, and deserve to have healthy food on the menu for them as well!  Granted their parents would still probably order them fried this & cheezy and salty that, but there should still be a CHOICE.  \n\nP.S.S. - Adding that, for breakfast, they actually used those rehydrated eggs-from-powder ... tasted like yellow chunks of chalk.  \n\nPork on, America!",

(Fainting couches line one wall).  \n\nFull bar.  \n\nYouthful bar staff.\n\nWhat I don't like:\n\nSo loud that I would not go there to eat.  It is for drinking even though there is a menu.\n\nTheir specials are very expensive (compared to regular menu items).  Ask for the prices as it is a surprise since their specials are not written down and the wait staff does not tell you unless asked (this is a trend game that I dislike about American restaurants).   \n\nTheir regular menu is not as expensive but imagine seeing an item labelled \"Seared Scallop\" for around $15?  Seems pricey for a scallop.  \n\nSpecials are read to you by the waiter or waitress with no price information given.  Since it is so loud you miss every other word so difficult to determine what is being offered.\n\nBeer selection was wide, but beer temperature was quite warm (This is Florida, not London, England).\n\nWait staff, while youthful and attractive, seemed novice and perhaps a little full of themselves.\n\nRecommended for:  Friday happy hours, girls' nights out and those who are not concerned about dining value.    Avoid if having a date night and you want to have a conversation.  Perfect to take a boring person to as there is no way they can speak loud enough to bore you.",

For the worse.  The buffet was not good at all even compared to other buffets.  I think the reason I felt that way immediately was I got 3 buffets and a 25 dollar game card that ended up costing over 50 dollars.  Doesn't sound too bad to get 3 buffets and some games but once you get in and see the buffet and the prices of the games it isn't worth it.  The buffet was only half open and the pizza wasn't hot.  The kids didn't seem to care because they were excited to play games.  Once we finished eating we went to the game area and things got worse.  5 frames of bowling for two kids  = $7!!!  Terrible.  Two go cart rides that was less than 3 minutes = $8.  2 roller coaster rides = $13!!!!!!!!  15 minutes and 25 bucks was gone!  I will say the employees were friendly and smiled.  However, we won't be back simply because for that price there are way better things to do.",

The $3 Guinness was a pleasant surprise.  I ordered a veggie burger and my boyfriend had some sort of chicken wrap.  He enjoyed his, but my veggie burger was pretty bland.  I opened up the bun and dumped a bunch of salt and pepper on it.  The server wasn't rude or anything, but she wasn't friendly or nice.  When my boyfriend asked for a water, she said okay but proceeded to clear two tables, wipe them down, go stand at the bar and check her phone, talk to the bartender, and then finally bring over a water.  There were at least 8 empty tables and not a lot of people coming in, so no need to do all that before grabbing a quick water.\nI don't know.  It was just mediocre.  Not terrible, not good.",

    "text": "Food was excellent, server was good. Had purchased a groupon ($35 off bill) earlier that day, as we were leaving town the next day. When we went to pay the bill, the server told us that she couldn't find our groupon and we had to write down the voucher number for her. A few minutes later, the manager came to the table and said \"your groupon isn't in our system so you can't use it\" and walked away. We had the email with the confirmation so went back to the register to ask about it. Again, the manager was very rude and just said \"what does your groupon say- it says you have to have a reservation\" and walked away again. So, yes, the fine print said reservations required, but this is not the type of place I can see anyone making a reservation, and they never mentioned that until they couldn't find it in the system. Also, I would have been fine with this if the manager had handled it politely. His immediate aggressive attitude was very insulting and made it ver uncomfortable to the other guests who weren't paying for the bill.",

    "text": "Food- C+\nBeer- B-\nAtmosphere- C\nService- B\n\nWent to Urban Village per request from a member of my group of friends to check it out after a month of their opening. It is pretty clear that they are still getting over a learning curve. We were seated outside and our waiter, while very polite, was overall not attentive and not knowledgeable of the menu. He was helpful with the beer selection though, so a plus there. In addition the lighting outside on the porch was just pitiful going into the sunset. You can't see anyone. Aim for a spot inside the restaurant if you are arriving at night. Great bathrooms though, very clean.\n\nWe all ordered some variant of the pizza just to try them all out. Out of 7 pies that we ordered, I really only liked 1, maybe two of them and even so, they were mostly dough and barely any cheese or toppings on them. For the price tag of around $12-14 a pie, that was really disappointing. Maybe the other food is better, but I cannot comment on that and only through my experience.\n\nThe beer itself was good, but I've had better from other brewpubs in the city at cheaper prices as well. Most of the beers are pretty entry-level if you are a craft beer lover, so nothing exciting.\n\nOverall it was nice to try out the place, I don't go to NoLibs often so it is a welcome addition to the neighborhood, but I don't think I will be returning for the food, maybe for 1-2 beers if I am getting ready to go out somewhere. However if it is too crowded I will be looking elsewhere as it is not worth any wait.",

It's very pretty and open with great design. \nOur waitress seemed a bit spacey and knew hardly anything about the menu, but it was only their second day open so I try to give some slack for new restaurants. However, she really should have been able to speak to the menu. We started off with the pastrami poutine and it was good but very rich. However, it was a good dish if you are wanting something substantial. Unfortunately that's about where the good ended. \nI had the turkey and brie sandwich with kale salad, and my BF had the fried chicken sandwich with farro salad. \nMy turkey sandwich was not good. It came with fig jam that was way too much jam and leaked onto the outside which made my hands extremely sticky. Overall it was heavy and the flavors didn't meld together at all. The kale salad had too much dressing on it and the fried chicken sandwich was bland. I enjoyed the farro salad at least. My latte was good, but small and the honey latte was way too sweet, but I guess that comes with the order. \nThe menu was promising and I was so excited for this place to open, but it was a let down after two years of waiting.",

For whatever reason, one of the managers stopped over and just about kicked us out, as if we were tying up one of his tables on Saturday night.  It was about 6 o'clock.

It gets really packed for dinner (especially if there is a convention in town) so I would try and make a reservation. We sat a party of 16 in the bar area since the dining room was all booked out.\n\nRandom Fact: St Elmo and Harry & Izzy's are owned by the same person.\n\nShrimp Cocktail - it was definitely the highlight of the meal. Great fresh shrimp with a cocktail-horseradish sauce that was awesome. I can tell why it is famous!\nCalamari - not bad, but nothing mind-blowing\nSeared Tuna - was fresh and pretty good. I did not care for the seaweed salad. It tasted kind of old to me.\nToasted Ravioli - okay. It was not crispy and I would have liked more flavor inside other than just cheese. It was like a mozzarella stick in ravioli form.\n\nLamb Chops - bland, under-cooked, cold. This was just not good. The apps were okay but this entree really turned me off from this place. It just lacked everything I would like in meat.\n\nThe rest of my party agreed that the entrees were a real disappointment. Great service and good drinks, but it could not save the entrees. If we are paying top dollar, then we would like the food to be on par with that. If I just had the entree, it would be 1 star, but everything else in the restaurant brought it up another star. Sadly do not think I will be coming back for dinner.",

How long is the wait?\n\n\"35 minutes\"... nothing like, \"We're happy you're hear...you see how great the response is...we're doing our best sir to get everyone seated as fast as possible...but it might be 35 minutes or so\". Just a flat... \"35 minutes\" the 7 second answer is way better than the 1 second. \n\nOk. How long is it taking to get food out after we've been seated?\n\n\"about 45 minutes\"..... I wasn't asked what I was thinking of ordering. Just an assumption.\n\nMay I see a menu?\n\nAnother assumption... \"We stop taking preorders at 4 pm...blah, blah\". I wanted to see the menue to assess what might take less time to serve. I KNOW deep dish takes more time. I was open to trying something else. \n\nOk. I'm not willing to wait an hour & fifteen minutes just to get my meal. \n\nAll I heard was.... \"sorrreeee\"...\n\nI go out to eat for the experience..... the food is only part of that.

When we first got there, there was no dedicated hostess to take our names and as a result we stood there trying to get someone's attention for over 5 minutes. When the waitress finally put our name down she told us that there was a 45-60 minutes wait, which we agreed with. However, when I looked around I counted 5 tables that were empty but no one had cleaned them off. \n\nThis was the major issue with this restaurant: there was no defined organization. The waiters were also the hostesses and had to bus tables and since they were busy none of them could do any of their roles well. \n\nWhen we were finally seated after 1 hour 15 minutes, we placed our order (we had plenty of time to determine what we wanted) and for spoons for our coffee since the waitress forgot to bring us some. She returned with 1 spoon and said that they were still washing dishes. When she finally brought the 2nd spoon it had milk still on it and some fuzz on it. I had never experience such disorder at any restaurant I've been to before. \n\nThe only saving grace was that the food was decent, it didn't look pretty but it tasted well. It is only because of the food that I gave this restaurant 2 stars because the service and wait time were horrendous.",

I asked nicely there was no need for the attitude. The second time we knew what to do, but our waitress had absolutely no personality, it really seemed like she just didn't care. I asked for water when we first ordered our drinks and I didn't get it until we paid. Every time she walked by I reminded her, but still had to wait. That meal we found a hair in our potatoes as well. It was pretty nasty but they were kind enough to take that item off the bill. And the last thing we all really disliked about this place was that they automatically put an 18% gratuity on your check. That service should not be tipped that much. Especially since it was so slow and it wasn't that packed while we were waiting for our food. If you don't really care about the quality of service then go here the food is excellent.

My mother and I waited over an hour to get our entrees and our server never apologized for the wait or came to check to see if we needed anything. I ordered the big easy benedict, which was supposed to have chorizo sausage and I literally had maybe 5 small slices of chorizo and the rest of my dish were the eggs and vegetables. Definitely not worth the money. I will give one star for the decor and one star for the manager who did stop by our table to take our drink and food orders when our waitress disappeared and did try to keep an eye on us from time to time. Their servers definitely need some training as well. Two of the people who brought food to our table did not know what dishes they were serving us and said the wrong names when they served our food/drinks. I don't see any reason to go back here.",

Our water was never refilled and we weren't asked if we wanted anything else. \n\nWhen we got the check, we noticed that there was a 18% gratuity added to the tab, even though there were only 3 of us. When we asked about it, we were informed that any bills over $50 had an 18% gratuity. Normally, I have no issue leaving a 20% tip but the service did not warrant an 18% tip.

    "text": "CASH ONLY, just a heads up.\n\nWith lots of diners to choose from around this area, I would have expected better service my first time here. I arrived excited, noting to my boyfriend that I think I had read good reviews for this diner. When we walked in I was surprised by the size, but I have been too much smaller diners. Walking by the register, I received no eye contact from the three waitresses crammed behind the counter. Not even so much as a \"hello\". I understand they may not want to be working on a Saturday morning, but at least the hello would be nice. One waitress seems to be annoyed by our presence, eyeing us up as we try to find our seats. We are obviously first timers to this establishment, but there is no help or sign that says to seat yourself or otherwise...very uncomfortable. We almost left. \n\nAfter sitting at the counter, I was unsure if we were going to be helped. the gentleman next to us was helped right away but yet again there was no eye contact given from waitress, even a simple \"I'll be right with you\" would've sufficed. We ended up getting a very nice waitress. The one working tables seemed to be having a bad day with all the whispering and eye dodging she was doing in front of us?...\n\nThe food was typical diner food, small portions as other ratings have mentioned. Unfortunately, my boyfriend did find a hair in his omelette. He did not mention this until we left as he steps lightly in those situations. Prices are far better at diners down the road.",

Sadly it was underwhelming from the minute we walked in the door.  There were only a few customers, and the two waitresses were watching TV and barely acknowledged us.  One of them approached but didn't say anything, she just grabbed some menus and took us to a table.  She didn't ask for drink orders or anything, just brought us some waters without saying a word.  \n\nWe selected several items from the sushi menu and waited for her to return.  And waited some more.  And some more.  Finally after about 10 minutes I got her attention and she came back and took my order sheet, again without saying a word.  The miso soup came out pretty quickly but it just wasn't great.  When the sushi arrived, I noticed it was only about half of our order.  I wasn't too worried about it though, because there was only one sushi chef behind the bar and it's not uncommon for places to bring out parts of your order over time.

And I still love that it's clean and has a lot of variety and great sale prices, so on and so forth and what have you. However, I'm sorry to say that I can no longer frequent this store due to its poor customer service. I don't know if they got a new manager or what, but in the past few months things there have gone seriously downhill. \n\nThere are rarely people available to bag groceries, which in turn slows checkout lines while the cashier and customer both try to do it. More than once I've gotten in a line with a bagger only to have that person walk away after finishing up with a customer. \n\nIn this same time period they have also gotten into the habit of stocking shelves during high traffic times - like Sunday's at 11. I get that items need to be on shelves, but I've seen them rearranging shelves during this time too - not necessary. It doesn't appear that they're just filling up on out of stock items - there are big carts and empty boxes in nearly every aisle at times. It causes so much traffic in the aisles and too many times you can't reach what you need. \n\nMy biggest complaint is about the deli, though. One of my favorite things about this store is the ability to order your deli items from a kiosk, do all of your shopping, and then whip around and pick up your items - no need to grab a number and wait. This kiosk allows you to specify how you want your items sliced. I always choose Very Thin, and I used to get it. For several months now, however, my meat has been cut so thick that even my carnivore husband is grossed out by it. Yesterday I had enough and just left it there, going then to a different store for those items. \n\nI wish this store had maintained the high quality experience it had in the beginning, but unfortunately it hasn't and as a result, it's former biggest fan will be shopping elsewhere.",

It's right next to my barber and I frequent Seven Cups a lot as well, so I thought I would give it a try.\n\nPJ Subs is, well...leaves much to be desired. The club sub was edible, though the chopped meats tasted freezer burnt and/or old. The bar area that I ate in was very run down and dirty as if it had not been deep cleaned for a year or two and the stools were beat up (could use some refreshing). I did not expect a lot from this establishment and was not surprised by anything. However, what really become bothersome and annoying was the constant ringing of a buzzer going off from what sounded like the kitchen area. On top of this, they let the phone ring and go unanswered several times. I understand staff may be preoccupied with other tasks, but please just answer the phone and turn off your timers. No one wants to dine with obnoxious noise distractions as those, even if it is just a sub and beer place.",

All the novel gourmet upscale items are gone from the menu, which leaves burgers, standard fare, and lots of fried appetizers. Biggest dismay was how anti-vegetarian they are; no veg burger option first two times here (they say they will add), and despite the hostess' assurances that they can \"make something up for you\" we got literally incredulous stares, disgusted hmmphs, rolled eyes, and hedging \"I don't know\"s when asking for small veg-friendly changes (eg vegs listed on the menu substituted for meat in pasta dishes; not a welcoming feeling at all. Meat-eating companions also found food mediocre and service very slow and confused. Hope they get their act together; has the potential to be great if they'll consider client feedback.",

    "text": "Doesn't look like much from the outside but I know you can't judge a book by it's cover so after reading some wonderful reviews we ventured in.  \n\nWe were seated and given menus promptly.    The place is nicely decorated, comfortable and clean.  Good start.  \n\nOur waiter seemed a by annoyed that it took us a bit to decide what to order although they weren't overly busy-no one waiting for a seat.  After getting coffee (waiter didn't offer creamer & there wasn't any on the table) my husband requested water and the waiter just looked at him.  He did bring it shortly, but I realized later that the hostess took water to another table so maybe that wasn't his job ??   Hubby ordered corned beef hash with eggs, I got the spinach cream cheese omelette w/fruit and ordered a side of hash browns, and our son ordered pancakes with chocolate chips and bacon. \n\nMy husband wasn't pleased with his corned beef.  It was grisly and not great.  Said he would rather have had canned.  He tried to use the pepper grinder but quickly decided it was too much work as he couldn't turn it without working really hard at it (although a nice touch to have one at each table of a restaurant).  My omelet didn't have much flavor, the hash browns had a \"wang\" to them, Hubby agreed and ketchup didn't cover the flavor even though I tried (they just tasted off -wondering if it was the oil they used or something) and the fruit I got wasn't cold and looked like they had mixed a new batch of fresh with old as some of the pineapple was great and some like it had sat for a few days- then with a couple of really fresh blackberries right on top.  My son ate his pancakes like a champ but the texture seemed weird to me.  \n\nSadly we won't be back as the reviews looked great & the food actually looked great on the plate as well, but sadly missed the mark for us.  Seasonings and textures just weren't right even though everything was visually appealing.  The only thing that tasted good to me was the bite of pancakes I took of my son's meal because I got a chocolate chip= flavor.",

    "text": "Overall experience just awful for our group(and apparently the tables around us).  We were seated at 6:33 on a Tuesday and sat there until we were finally greeted at 6:47.  We sat there after that until a little after 7 when we finally received our drinks.  That was over 35 minutes without even a water.   Our server disappeared multiple times while management did nothing to assure that everything was ok.  We finally got our starters, a few orders of guac, which were amazing(hence the 2 stars) before right around when our drinks finally arrived.  The table next to us began to have the same complaint as they arrived and didnt get waited on until about 15 minutes after seating.  The food itself was average but it did not make up for the complete ineptitude of service that became so frustrating to our table(all of us are waiters and bartenders).  This is now the second straight time coming here with the same server and the experience was beyond bad.  When we were finally finished and paid, of course a manager was the first person to the table to come and clean it up before we had all even gotten up but refused to check in at all during the dinner.  One of the more frustrating experiences at a restaurant in a long time, probably will not be going back here even though I live right across the street.",

Unfortunately, she acted as though I personally offended her and was passive aggressive and super rude the rest of the night. I ordered wings and she didn't once speak to us again.

    "text": "Let me start off by saying that I LOVE the Crooked Fence beers - delicious, unique, and some of the best that Boise has to offer in craft beer.  I really wanted to like this restaurant, but our experience this last Saturday was poor enough that I will not return except maybe for beer.\n\nI arrived around noon with my dad, sister, brother in law, and 4 year old niece, and the place was half full, and there appeared to be plenty of staff to handle the workload.  Unfortunately, our service was really quite poor.  We were seated by a friendly host and I was very thirsty, so I asked if they could bring us some water.  The water did not come, instead we had to wait a while for our server to make her way to our table.  My sister ordered an expedited children's meal (you know how kids can be when they are hungry) and asked for a glass of wine, but they were out.  Then the server moved on to another table without asking for anyone else's drink order!  A while later she returned with our waters and the rest of us got a chance to order a beer.  \n\nMy niece's food arrived promptly, which was much appreciated.  After being ignored by the server for too long, I took it upon myself to go to the bar and ask for a refill on my water.  After at least a half hour waiting, our food arrived, and unfortunately it was subpar.  This place has a very enticing menu with a lot of interesting options, which makes the food quality all the more disappointing.  My dad ordered the Barrelhouse Platter, a selection of house made sausages and mustards for dipping.  He shared with me and the taste was good, though the presentation was unspectacular.  My chicken grinder had decent flavor, but was difficult to eat without making a mess.  2/3 of the meat was spilled on the plate and the roll for the sandwich was too small to fit the meat.  The fries were some of the worst I've ever had.  They tasted like they were a day old - stale, overcooked, and luke warm in temperature at best.  \n\nMy sister ordered the pork chops with fries specifically because she has a gluten intolerance, and this was made clear to the server.  Well, her plate arrived with mashed potatoes and gluten filled gravy, on top of which was her porkchops.  The chops were also served without the teriyaki sauce and were quite overcooked (she let me try a piece).  Lastly my brother in law ordered a hamburger.  For $11, it was a very small patty (looked like a 1/4 pounder you would get at a fast food place) and had toppings of cheese and jalapenos.  Nothing else - no lettuce/tomato/onion.  Disappointing all around.  \n\nTo their credit, they offered to bring my sister another pork chop and bring us new fries.  We declined because we had places to be, and we had already been there for an hour and a half at that point due to the slow service.  To make up for the multiple mistakes, the waittress took 10% off our total bill (which amounted to about $6 off).  \n\nWho knows - maybe this place just had a really bad day.  I was very disappointed with our server and the food, and feel like they should have done more to make up for the bad experience.  In the future, I will eat somewhere else and get my Crooked Fence beer from their tasting room on Chinden.",

It pains me to give this place a bad review because it's a Tucson icon and I've been coming here for years.  It just keeps getting worse, unfortunately.  The food recently is typically cold, bland and overpriced.  Most recent visit we ordered the $9 guac which was never delivered but naturally still added to the bill.  The kids tacos were supposed to be soft shell and came out hard shelled and the meat was cold and dry.  The applesauce they served with the kids meal was expired by two months.  Ugh...its just not worth the $ they charge to keep giving them my business.",

I would have liked some vegan cheese on the burger but it wasn't an option.  The sweet potato fries are pretty good, nice and crispy.\n\nI'm not sure what their excuse is for not having a solid veggie burger given their whole thing is vegan food.  Most of their menu items seem like they are trying to produce vegan food that tastes like its not.  I enjoy vegan food from time to time and when I order it, its because I don't want meat so a trick chicken sandwhich or a burger that is trying to imitate ground beef isn't enticing.  \n\nAlso their green tea is sweetened - yuck.\n\nTheir salads sound good, but I doubt I'll be back.",

However, this is the second time I had hair in my food and they refuse to take responsibility for it. Both waitresses came back to make excuses rather than take responsibility of serving food with hair. The management did not approach us at all and said they would take the item off the check, though they normally wouldn't do that because I ate most of it!! I was beyond furious with the service because of course I would not eat any if that was the first piece I ate. This establishment needs better hygiene and better service.",

We had previously stopped into El Camino for a couple of cocktails and noticed the fine menu, so for sure it was the right choice.\n\nIt appeared to be a slow day -- but it was before noon, so we can not judge. It took a bit of effort but we narrowed our choices down to the Huevos Rancheros and the Fried Chicken and Biscuits.\n\nAs for the Huevos ... a heaping pile of meat and beans and cheese all snugly in a sizzling skillet. It may have actually been too much to handle as we sadly left more than half in the skillet ...That being said, we would have loved to have finished it as the flavors and textures were right on.\n\nFried Chicken and Biscuits with Sausage Gravy ... what do we picture? A couple nice and crispy strips of chicken two fluffy cratered biscuits under a blanket of sausage gravy ... the key to this picture would be the inability to actually see the biscuits under the blanket of gravy.... not the case.\n\nIf their is one single breakfast item which I crave, it's biscuits and gravy. I do not feel as if I should ever have to ask for more gravy ... the essence of the dish is excess. I don't care how moist you think your biscuits are ... give-me-more-GRAVY!\n\nIt killed it for me ... the better half enjoyed her huevos ... and I enjoyed the chicken .... but I pray for a line cook with a heavier hand next time.\n\nWe will return ... but cautiously.",

First thing is the convenience and that definitely is great, but the downside is whoever runs this place knows fools like me will pay more so we don't have to walk too far so they jack up the prices. Secondly they are always out of stuff. White meat ground turkey, sells out withing a few hours while dark meat lingers there. You'd think they'd change the orders around. Same with cereal, the cereal I want is always sold out! I asked the manager to order something for me and he wouldn't that sucked, but on the other hand the checkout people are really nice.

Great walk up appeal, just down the street from a park. Everything you could ask for in a location. 5 stars*****\n\nInside, still very original. Nice art work, felt very natural and open. 4 stars****\n\nThe food, not for me. I ordered the Surrey's Eggs. I wanted something not too heavy since we would be walking around NO all day for the final four festivities. The Banana's Fosters French Toast was screaming my name but I had to hold me self back. The service was very fast but the food was just bland. No seasoning, no butter, not even any jelly for my toast. Nothing on my plate between my eggs, potatoes, or toast made me want to eat anything again.Maybe on another day I can try out that French Toast but I don't have the highest of hopes. I  normally would  have given this more than 2 stars, but the definition of 2 stars is \"meh, I've experienced better.\" Right on the money.",

    "text": "We have stayed here several times.  First, the positive.  This place is absolutely GORGEOUS!!!   It feels like Hawaii!  I can't say enough good things about how beautiful it is inside.  The plants, waterfalls and natural light are just amazing.  The reason I am giving it only two stars is because of the service and COST.  Our room was not ready at check-in (after waiting over half an hour in line).  Since we arrived before 4:00 we had to come back to get the room key which required waiting another half an hour in the \"key pick up\" line.  Lots of waiting.  Lots of lines.  They charge you extras for EVERYTHING!  ...parking..resort fees etc.  The room isn't cheap to begin with but then you add on all these extra fees and taxes.  Be prepared that you will pay a lot more than the quoted room rate when you are booking (which is not cheap either!).  On our most recent visit, when we finally got to our room we brought in the bags that we were carrying and then made a quick trip to the car to get our luggage.  When we got back to the room (15 minutes later - max!) someone from housekeeping had been in and for some reason completely stripped the beds!  It was so strange!  When we originally got to our room it was obviously clean, beds made, so I have no idea why they would have done this.  It took over half an hour for someone to respond to our call.  Then after housekeeping did arrive they took another half hour to bring sheets and make the beds.  All this after all the waiting to check in!  Bottom line, this place is stunning but know what you're getting into in terms of cost.  I just like everything to be upfront and I feel like when there are all these hidden fees, it feels slightly deceptive to me or something.  For our family of four, two nights cost us just under $1,000 with all the charges and some meals.   Despite the 2 star review I probably would stay here again because I just love how beautiful the inside is and we love Nashville!",

    "text": "I never got to the main menu because the young man waiter who waited on us couldn't make his mind up if he wanted to serve us the Happy Hour menu or the main menu. We finally settled with the Happy Hour menu because he was very non-communicative. When 1 salad arrived, I was given my friend's salad and wolfed it down before I realized it wasn't the one I ordered. I did think it was strange because I was clear I wanted bell peppers on it and would pay for it. The turkey soup was cold, so I had to send it back, and then it came back too hot. We also ordered corn tacos and the waiter never said if they're soft or hard shell tacos. I wanted hard shell and I forgot to ask him, because tacos are usually hard shell.  But, guess what?  They were soft, but tasty though, but could have had more meat.\n\nWhat really bothered us (and we're not uptight by any means) was the loud south-of-the-border music that sounded like a big party was going on of 100 or 200 people, and there were only 3 people in the restaurant! \n\nOur waiter never really returned after the wrong salad given and another more professional woman came, but by then we were ready to leave. The ice tea was given in a glass that looked more like tall skinny shot glass, and of course he didn't think to bring us any sweetener, so we had to get up and get it. The salad could have definitely had more ingredients in it for anybody. The one that I originally ordered didn't look much better, except that it did have my bell peppers. The waiter never offered bread, so we ordered a tortilla, which was stale. I don't know how they can serve a stale tortilla, but they managed to do it. \n\nI've heard good things about this restaurant; that's why I went there. But maybe the management went on vacation or something. I don't think I'd take a chance on going back though.",

    "text": "TL;DR -- Overpriced \"nickel and diming\" with mediocre cuisine and mediocre service.\n\nOur party of six was attracted to Moto by their ads for \"Moto Mondays\", which is a tasting menu with a  flight of wine for $25.  \n\nUpon being escorted to our table, they stepped on one of my pet peeves which is immediately trying to up-sell us on Pellegrino vs \"tap water\".  We were fine with tap water, which was served European style-- lukewarm with no ice.  Since it was 83 degrees outside with 70% humidity, we found this unsatisfactory and had to request ice.\n\nWhen we asked about the tasting menu, we were told that the serving sizes were very small and we should get something else.  I find it obnoxious that a restaurant advertises a special and then when you get there they try to convince you not to order it!  \"It will never satisfy you!\"  Then why are you selling it!?  If the answer is \"bait and switch\", then it's  a fake deal.  It tells me you don't want repeat business.\n\nEveryone else in my party ordered something else, but I stuck with the tasting menu.  After all, that's why I showed up.  True to the waitress's warning, the three dishes which comprised the tasting menu failed to satisfy.  There was a tiny crudo (raw whitefish with rock salt) paired with a heavy red, a tiny mushroom pizza paired with a sparkling rose, and a thick piece of toast with a thin layer of prosciutto paired with a riesling.  In that order. \n\nThe flight of wine was lower quality, didn't pair well with the  food, and the servings were miserly splashes.\n\nThe crudo was so over-salted that I had a hard time eating it and it made no sense with the red.  I'd just started on the mushroom pizza when the waitress dropped by to ask if everything \"tasted wonderful\".  I said that the mushroom pizza was nice, but that the fish was too salty.  She replied, \"here, we love our food salty\".  I don't think that insulting your guest's palate is a great customer service technique.  \n\nTo sum up, the tasting menu, far from being a chef's calling card, an opportunity to experience something fun and creative, was a half baked and poorly executed marketing exercise-- and a terrible value to boot.    No one else in my party was particularly impressed with their dishes either.  The phrase \"not bad but overpriced\" came up a lot.  I wound up embarrassed that I'd suggested the place.\n\nAs a final insult, Moto's enforces mandatory 20% tipping.\n\nMoto Monday ensured that I won't be back for Tuesday through Sunday.",

    "text": "Let me first off say I'm appreciative of the Monday night special, 1 topping large pizza for $10.82 out the door.  That was nice, especially since I didn't really care for it.  The crust was meh, the sauce was ok, the cheese whilst I'm sure is fresh and it did have a nice texture, but it also didn't have much flavor.  I also don't like how I ordered extra cheese and it didn't even cover the entire pizza.  Basically they spread the sauce almost to the edge of the crust, and then the cheese is a good half inch further down from that.  It was ok, but I won't be back for pizza only.  Would like to try the fried chicken next time since others have said it is very good.  I will say all the staff I spoke to were very polite, kind and attentive.  That right there is worth coming back for!",

I've worked in a pizza joint, been a sandwich artist, and have sling many a beer in my day but never have I encountered the snail like pace of the taco shop employees. I walk in and wait the first five minutes for the counter person to finish his personal phone call. I know it to be personal when he says, \"oh, I gotta go, there are like people here\". Then begins to take our order. He finds out we're trying to dine in and refers us to a table. \nSitting at said table for 10 min or so and we wonder where the people we saw behind the counter ran off to. Surely someone will bring menus or something soon. \nWait more... Ok now I'm really hungry and we go back to the counter to just get food to go and eat in the car. \nTasty tacos but not worth the wait or confusion that they require.",

It seemed to be a random assortment of pizza toppings thrown together. It was 80% spinach, 10% feta and the rest very small amounts of onion and literally 3 small pieces of warm iceberg lettuce. My advice, do not offer something on your menu if you're not going to do it right. The small Greek pizza was pretty good but the thin crust we ordered was actually quite doughy, which we both were surprised by. Honestly, I do not plan on going back.",

It wasn't terribly busy -- it was fairly steady with a very large children's birthday party in the corner. We sat smack dab in front of the window, with a clear shot of the bar and all the wonderful art deco-ish paintings.\nIt might as well been the dead zone. We watched no less than four staff members behind the bar checking their phones, ribbing each other, staring off into space... and we sat and we sat... unattended. \nThen a very sweaty -- to be honest it was an extremely hot day -- and smelly waiter. It was pungent. We ordered grill veggie sandwich and a chicken salad number, a raspberry soda and a coke. \nThe food was bland and ill prepared. Nothing special. \nThe dessert was indeed incredible -- a brownie baked in a cup.\nWe just can't understand why people love this place. It might serve as an after theatre dessert place, but other than that there's little to redeem it. \nPeople seem to love the decor, and frankly, it's just not impressive to anyone who has been outside of Missouri, heck outside of midtown. \nNot recommended. \nSpend your hard-earned money elsewhere.\nThe sad neglected fountain out front says it all.\nThese people don't care.",

    "text": "I took my family to the restaurant about 10 days ago.  We arrived about 7:15 and were seated withing about 5 minutes (6 of us).  We had a concert to be at by 9:30, so I thought we would have plenty of time.  \n\nThe waitress was somewhat attentive and got our appetizer down (came in about 15 minutes) and we ordered our burgers, and waited about 30-40 minutes for those to arrive.  They were good burgers, and unique sauces for the fries we shared.  \n\nAt about 8:25 we ordered 3 shakes, 2 dishes of ice cream, and one cone of the anticipated ice cream.  At 9:00 we had not seen the waitress, and the ice cream still had not shown.  I saw the waitress and told her that it had bee 30 minutes and we needed to go, so would she please cancel the ice cream and get my ticket.  However, she seemed to be trying to wait for our ice cream.  at 9:05 she brought our ticket (minus the ice cream).  the ice cream arrived at the same time, but we said we needed to go.  They offered to put the shakes into a to-go cup, but did not show up.  I paid the bill (still tipped the slow server 20% because I am not sure who's fault it was).  We left about 9:15.  \n\nI emailed the manager and heard from him today, and he has helped explain the actions taken that night and has generously asked to help get me back to try again - we will and hope to have a better experience!\n\nUpdate -  the manager said he would send me a gift card to help us come back to try again. But he never sent  it. I will not go out of my way to go back. There are many other choices downtown.",

But it still took 20 minutes. With that said, my bibimbap came out cold. Like not cold because it's meant to be served cold, but cold as in the food was already cold when it got to our table. I don't know how you can really go wrong with bibimbap but this place does not deserve 4.5 star. The owner was nice so I feel bad for giving this a bad review, but the food is not that great.

    "text": "My date and I popped in to Los Jefes for a late afternoon lunch recently, hoping that this colorful Mexican joint would be a new addition to our taco and fajita rotation.  Our hopes were dashed after a less than stellar experience.\n\nMy main beef is regarding the service.  Although the place was not that busy, it took forever to  1.) be greeted, 2.) to receive our drinks, 3.) to have our orders taken and 4.) to receive refills of chips and salsa.  The drinks we ordered were just the basic house frozen margaritas, nothing special or extra, literally comes out of a daiquiri machine.  On top of all that, our orders did not arrive both at once.  This is a huge pet peeve for me when dining out because it feels rude to me to start digging into my meal when others at my table are still waiting on their food.  \n\nI was hoping that the food and drinks would excuse the poor service, but honestly, I've had better elsewhere.  It's awesome that you get a free order of queso when checking in with the Yelp app, but it came out cold!  The redfish tacos were tasty enough, but for the price, I wish there could have been more fish.  The margaritas were okay, but again, I've had better at other restaurants.\n\nIf a restaurant is going to earn a return visit from me, it needs to be consistent on both it's service and food.  Los Jefes gave me neither.  On a side note, the owner stopped by our table and thanks us for dining there, which was cool.  Unfortunately, this gesture is not enough for me to eat here again.",

From not being greeted, having to break up the horseplay and conversations behind the counter just to ask for help, in the middle of ordering two more kids come in and the girl getting my order stops to go talk to her friends, another guy had to grab my cup and finish my order. When I asked what flavor something was, the girl tells me she can't see what I'm pointing at and I should read the label, problem was the label was missing. I asked for my receipt so I could reference my experience when I wrote them, which I did and still haven't heard back from Frost, the kid actually tells me they were out of paper and that the manager went to the store to get more. It's late at night and that was the excuse they gave me! \nWe have gone here 2-3 times a month for about 3 years and this was by far the worst we've ever experienced. I doubt we'll be going back",

Went last night with another couple and ordered warm ricotta with toast, again, great. Mussels were great. Waiter talked us into the meatballs and when 3 arrived for 4 of us, it was awkward. Flavor was good though. Service started great and went downhill from there.\nThe ugly - ordered a sausage pizza and beet salad. Salad never showed but it was left on the bill. We had it removed. The pizza - signature item- DON'T do it!!!!!\nSausage pizza had 3 pieces on sausage, no cheese and when the waitress brought it to our table, she told us that they don't cut them because the pizza gets soggy. We asked her to recommend best way to eat it -\"well I suggest a knife and fork\" and away she went! She was right, it was soggy-like someone dipped it in water - how does that happen to a pizza that comes out of a brick oven? \nAva - you need to step up - you should expect more from your brand. Charge based on your portions, be competitive and if you can't serve good pizza - take it off the menu!",

Sweet potato fries were good. \n\nToday while at lunch with a group of colleagues the most disturbing thing happened. I noticed the manager in a green sweater lingering around the entrance and then two cop cars with lights flashing pulled up and 3 officers rushed in walked to the table next to us that the manager was pointing to and one of the officer's proceeded to pull out their handcuffs and tell the guy delivering food to put food down at the table and hands behind his back. They escorted him near the front door and had him sit down for a moment before taking him outside in freeZing cold with no jacket where he stood for a few minutes while cops came in and out of restaurant. \n\nThis entire thing was poorly handled, disturbing and unsettling not only to the customers but the other staff. They should have had the cops walk back away from where customers were and deal with it there. Then all the managers disappeared not available to talk to any of the customers let alone apologize or acknowledge people being unsettled. \n\nNo one needs to know why the arrest happened but there needed to be more care for customers and staff in how it was handled. \n\nNot ok!!!",

    "text": "Paddy Whacks is located on South Street in an area which they could have a good business of getting customers in. But apparently, it seems that is not the case. I have been to their Northeast Philadelphia location, so I decided to try out this other location in South Street. It is metered street parking everyday up to 10pm, so make sure that you feed that meter during that time. It is not handicap accessible. Bathrooms are located down the stairs in the basement. I have to tell you though as you walk down the steps, you can't help but notice the stench of urine in the air. They really need to do a thorough cleaning of their bathrooms and hallways. Our server greeted us and was friendly when we arrived. The bartender also acknowledged us as we were seated in a booth. Seating is limited. I noticed though that the open floor area around the bar is very spacious. I presume that they prefer to accommodate the standing room only for bar patrons rather than dining in customers? It is impossible to have a conversation going with your group because they have the tv volume blasting out very loud and tuned  to the Phillies game going on. The Cheeseburger sliders had no dressing whatsoever. The bun was dry, the patty was dry and lacked flavor. Caesar Salad was so-so, nothing special. The Shepherd's Pie was very oily. Oil coming from the ground meat? Apparently, the type of ground meat they used had the ratio of more fat than lean? The Kilkenny Chocolate Cake with Vanilla ice cream was the only dish that is delicious. I am disappointed at our visit to this establishment. Sorry to say that this is our first and last visit to Paddy Whacks in South Street.",

My food was bland, the spring rolls were fishy, the soda chanh was intensely sugared and I left feeling, \"eh.\" We went last Friday and I ate pesce while there. I went with the tofu lemongrass and I seriously wish there was more sauce. It barely covered my tofu which left me eating unsauced noodles. I tried adding a ton of add-ons to try and get some flavor out of the sauce but no dice. The peanut sauce for the shrimp rolls was super watery and again the shrimp tasted old. The soda chanh was crazy sweet. I still enjoyed it but between that and the food I wavered between over-sugared and over-salted. My manpanion had the pho and he gave it an \"eh\" as well. I will say the prices were pretty awesome but I'm not sure we'll be back. There are other Vietnamese restaurants that I would rather frequent, e.g. Far East. FYI - they are now run by the owners of Miss Saigon and I had that very same dish there. It was sauced well and had much more flavor.",

The turkey tasted like the cheapest cold cuts they could find with eggs and american cheese (they didnt have cheddar cheese which is a downfall in my opinion).  I specifically asked for Rye Toast (toasted....i made that clear) and when it came, it looked and felt and tasted as if they put it in the toaster over for about two seconds.  It was barely cripsy at all!  My boyfriends sandwich wasnt all that bad but we've had better.  I gave it two stars because it was exactly that...meh ive experienced better.

The first three (on top) were OK, the last three (on the bottom) were not good at all. The icing flavors just didn't mix well together with the actual donut. For $2 per donut for donuts I was not impressed with at all, I would not get donuts from here again. Save yourself some money and go to Beilers for better donuts that are only $1 per. The fact that the store is called \"Federal DONUTS\" and only had six \"fancy donut\" flavors and three \"sprinkled sugar\" flavors was also far from impressive. \n\nI hear the fried chicken here is good so maybe one day we'll come back to check that out.

There was nothing French toast about it - it was griddle partially burned challa- completely regular bread in the middle, it didnt have a trace of egg soaked French toast flavor. it was as if they took the bread out of the bag and stuck it on  a greasy  fry top with whatever they used- threw the whole thing in the trash after two bites.",

I have experienced amazing vegetable sides at other restaurants, but this entree was nothing to write home about.\n\nAs for desserts he had the cheesecake, which was fine, not amazing but nothing bad to say about it either. I had the strawberries and once again, thats all it was. Don't expext them to come out plated amazingly or even with whipped cream, they're only sliced strawberries.\n\nHonestly, for the money I don't think it was worth it.

It was frustrating because we ordered miso soup and chicken and rice soup and mine came out good but my friends was like warm and the chicken was not good, very flavorless, not to mention it literally took about 30 minutes for just our soup to come out. While they had time to eat and talk and take care of Togo orders, while we wait waterless and impatient for soup that came out 30 minutes later and not even warm. Then we waiting another 15 for our rolls. They were fresh and we enjoyed them. Just annoying to feel like we weren't taken care of when they easily could have with how slow they were and with the three people that were on. Probably won't eat in again, obviously the Togo orders take priority over the guests in your restaurant.",

The hash browns were greasy and fairly tasteless. The bacon overcooked, hard and chewy.  Obviously had been sitting awhile. Overall, very uninspired food.

Each time, some different person manages to get my order wrong. \n\nDon't get me wrong, I love Panera bread, but the service that this location provides is horrible! The first time I ordered a panini and I stood there for at least 15 minutes before I went up and asked about my order. It turns out, \"it never went through\" (although the charge on my credit card certainly did!) The mistakes made in the second/third orders were also relatively small but irritating to fix. How hard is it to take an order for a salad or a sandwich?? Usually the place is pretty empty too =/\n\nI think the 4th time is the last straw. They messed up the salad that I ordered (I asked them to omit some ingredients because of allergy restrictions) and when I checked the receipt, saw they charged me for \"extra\"!  So I got back in line holding my salad like a huge idiot, and after a 20minute wait (even though there were only 2 customers ahead of me), it took 5 different people another 20minutes to solve the issue. In total I probably spent about 45minutes just waiting to get the right food. They refunded me the \"extras\" charge, but not the cost of the total bill (about $8). I\"m trying not to gripe about 8 bucks, but a 45minute wait is kind of ridiculous.\n\nPassing on this Panera forever =/\nHopefully other Paneras in this area will be better.",

(Party of 5 plus one munchkin) The restaurant was not busy by any means however our food took approx. an HOUR to arrive at our table after placing our orders. Other patrons dined and exited as we waited for our meals.  When our food finally arrived it did not include my meal. My family graciously waited until I received my food (Cuban sandwich which was very tasty, btw) before they ate and by then all of their meals were cold. Our waiter was very apologetic and swore up and down that he turned in my order with the others and blamed it on the kitchen. My sandwich ended up being comped which I felt was fair. However I was really worried about the fact that we had parked in a pay by the hour parking lot since we waited so long for our food to arrive. When we were finished with our meal we headed to the parking lot only t o find a $40.00 parking ticket. I returned to the restaurant and asked the manager if he would be so kind as to help me out with it since we had waited exceedingly long for our meals. He said there was nothing he could do and compared it to me expecting him to pay for a speeding ticket?! Thank you Margaritaville Nashville for making my Mother's Day one to remember.",

We ordered a small plate they were out of the main ingredient.  The we were told the specials.  It was 630 pm.  Not crowded yet, and I ordered the Prime rib which was one of the specials.  The waiter came back to tell us they were out of the prime rib.  I think when you have a special, you need to have enough of it, especially when it wasn't that crowded yet.  Food was just ok.  Music was so loud, couldn't hear the person next to me.  Would not go back!",

I took my first bite and was so disappointed. The sausage had a weird taste so the second bite I tried to figure out what was wrong. I came to the conclusion after I finished my only piece that either someone there made a mistake and used hamburger or they had some bad sausage. So I was disappointed to say the least after spending $26 and not able to eat it. Sorry but I don't think I will try again cause I don't know if a mistake was made or they use sub par meats.",

    "text": "This is a totally mixed review and here's why~ I have been to the Original Oteri's and had great things but recently went to the newer bakery near Franklin Mills, NE Philly and it was horrible! I ordered cookies, which were just average, and 2 cupcakes. The cupcakes were so hard and stale that they did not crumbel but instead broke in chunks. I have never seen icing so hard, the jimmies on the cupcakes were a faded color, old and stale:( I was very excited to have an original Philly bakery around and then this. After this I went to buy pies for Thanksgiving, they were ok but packaged so poorly (just wrapped in a clear cling wrap type of wrap) that they were ruined by the time I got them home. I also bought a slice of Italian Cream Cake, it was actually pretty good. While there the first time I did notice an Oteri's delviery truck making their delivery I assume from another where they bake everything? I hope this is not how they are going to be because I would really like to go back and get some more goodies!!",

    "text": "WOW! Let me just start off by saying this place is packed or maybe it was just packed the Monday evening I was there. My husband and I were craving yummy pizza so we came across Pizzeria Vetri and decided to try it out. We had a choice of either waiting 30 minutes for a table that would basically be shared with other people or eating at the pizza bar right away. I didn't mind watching the food get made. It was pretty cool in fact! We were offered sparkling or \"normal\" water and we chose the latter. \nMy husband and I couldn't find a pizza we both desired so we ordered two separate ones: the crudo and the salsiccia. We also ordered a Rotolo because every other table seemed to be ordering one and it looked delicious. To be honest, I think the Rotolo was my favorite perhaps because it was the first time I tried it. \nNow back on topic, the pizza's were edible. Were they delicious? Eh. My husband and I don't exactly like vegetables. We never crave vegetables to be exact. However, while eating the pizza's here, we were both wishing we ordered a salad. I'm not sure how to explain it but the food wasn't exactly greasy but it felt that way. I wish they offered some pizza's that had meat and vegetables on them. For example, a Prosciutto pizza with spinach and cherry tomatoes. Now that sounds delicious! \nThe service was A-OK mostly due to being busy. We needed napkins but never got them. We also waited about five minutes for the check to come. The whole experience felt rushed because the restaurant was packed and busy. \nAll in All, I don't think I will be going back as I didn't enjoy the experience or find the food worth $60 dollars.",

    "text": "Was hoping for a better experience, but I'll give them another try next time I'm in the area because I prefer to support local coffee shops. I really want to like this place.\n\nFirst off, good luck finding the shop. I knew exactly where it was supposed to be based on GPS, but I overlooked the place twice due to poor signage and ended up driving around that same building twice and then wandered further around to a different section of Westhaven before finally seeing a sign for it!\n\nI feel the drink menu (coffee and espresso) is a little limited. They do have different food options including baked goods, biscuits, and even ice cream. It was after I had ordered and paid for my mocha that I found the muffins wrapped and stored on a centerpiece server on the middle of the big table where patrons were sitting. So I went back and grabbed one and paid separately. My mocha was on par. The muffin was just not very appetizing. The service was fine, but they didn't go out of their way to smile or make you feel welcomed.\n\nOh yeah, my lid came off my drink twice, but fortunately it did not result in a major spill. I had trouble getting the lid to fit on my cup.\n\nThey also have tea and coffee by the bag for sale, as well as gifts.  The place is beautiful and rustic on the inside.

    "text": "Went here after seeing a matinee show at the Broadway Theater at Pitman across the street. Upon walking in, we saw just one guy in the kitchen and one waitress, with several tables full of people who had no food yet. We had a bad feeling that this was going to be a longer than desired dining experience and debated leaving. We should have done so.\n\nIt took a while to get drinks, all of which were served in plastic cups. The sangria pitcher arrived, and we had to pour the bottle of wine ourselves - fine, as I assumed there were legal reasons for this. But we got nothing to stir it up with, so the wine just sat there on top. \n\nEventually the waitress came back to get our food order, which took forever to arrive. My chorizo tacos were barely warm. The rice was hot at least? Again, everything was served on paper or plastic. It was sort of like eating at a glorified food truck. The food itself was ok, but generally pretty bland. Chorizo should not be bland, so I am not sure what went wrong there. My husband had a quesadilla, and my friend had mushroom enchiladas. Both said they were average. The rice was really the only thing I can say we enjoyed.\n\nFinally, we go to pay the bill, and only then are we told that the place is basically cash only. This isn't posted anywhere. Not on the door. Not on the menu. Not mentioned by the waitress. She then says she can do a credit card if it's an emergency. Well, in our case we didn't have another choice. So she took our credit card and left the restaurant to go run it at another business or something - I don't know.\n\nConsidering the slow service and luke warm flavorless food...we won't be back.",

    "text": "Too big, too expensive and too far from Downtown.  \n\nI was here for a conference, which seemed like an awesome idea. It wasn't.  I'm in Direct Sales and (like most people at this conference) don't have tons of extra money to spend on mediocre meals when I'm traveling.  $10 for a slice of generic pizza, small side salad and a soda for lunch.   I understand it's a hotel but there weren't any options close by.  Just getting your car from valet was a hassle and took a lot of time.  Being such a big property, it made getting to restaurants off the property really time intensive.  Since you're so far out of Nashville (out near the airport), the good little holes you find when you're in a city are pretty nonexistent.  \n\nThe property itself was great.  The hotel is HUGE but really pretty.  I enjoyed walking around but was really happy when I found what I didn't know existed...a shortcut between my room and the Convention Center.  It took my 10-15 minute walk down to about 3 minutes!  BONUS!  Like I said, this place is ginormous.  \n\nRoom: Our room was great.  I shared a wonderful suite in the Garden Conservatory with 2 other girls.  We were under a group rate and my friend was quoted $200/night, which is awesome for the space we had.  We had a large room (probably used as a hospitality suite for groups) for socializing.  It had a great bar area set-up and a nice big fridge and lots of drawer space.  Our bedroom was separated by doors that could be locked from either side (like an adjoining room), so it looked like the hospitality suite could be reserved without reserving the room.  It was different than what I was expecting, but whatevs.  It was fine.  So, I wasn't there at check-in.  The girl who reserved the room checked in a couple days earlier than my friend and I.  So, Sunday comes, and the bill was waiting for us when we woke up.  Our friend was charged $1200 for one room (I'm guessing the suite) and $1400 for the other room.  YEP.  She reserved what she thought was a 2 room suite for $200.  The bedroom door was closed when she got there and she asked them to open it up. It was all arranged by the bellman.  She was never told that the bedroom wasn't included....kind of necessary if you're staying over for 6 nights, dontcha think???  So, she's being charged $2600 for what was supposed to be $1200.  Last I heard, the Gaylord's legal department was investigating what she was told, what she wasn't told and if they should charge her the entire amount.  \n\nCheckout:  A FREAKING NIGHTMARE.  Between the money situation, which was not resolved as of late this week, and the 45 minute wait for a cart (in a hotel that holds thousands of people, you'd think they'd be plentiful and they aren't) and a 25 minute wait for the car, my friend and I decided to sweat it out and schlep our goods to the door where our car would be delivered to us.  It was not a short walk and we had a TON of stuff, which meant multiple trips.  UGH.\n\nI'm sure I'll be back for another conference (I am pretty sure my company has booked this for at least one more year....) but I'm not going to be happy about it.  I might even consider driving down, staying in a hotel somewhere downtown and driving out to the Conference stuff.",

I've been a server so I understand a slow kitchen may not be a server's fault, but he was very rude. He would drop off a drink or bread and not say a word. Multiple times we tried to ask him for something but he ran away from our table so quickly that he didn't hear (or acknowledge) us. The food is good--nothing so good that I would say the wait and poor service were worth it. The waiter didn't even say goodby to us. A bit disappointed.",

    "text": "I have driven PAST Blake's in Deming, NM on my way out of Hatch so many times and always thought to myself, \"Huh, I really should try them out.\" But I never do because I just want to get home to Tucson and to be honest, 9 times out of 10 I just put a Sparky's green chile cheeseburger in my belly so I wasn't hungry. When Blake's came to Tucson, I was really excited!!!\n\nDon't believe the hype. The green chile cheeseburger at Blake's is a mediocre burger overall with the saving grace being the green chile. The green chile is delicious but not very hot, at least for my taste but that's not where I find fault with this burger. The actual burger is greasy and just a whatever burger. Mine was thrown together so sloppily that I had more onions and tomatoes off the bun than on it. I literally had to put my burger back together before I could eat it. And then the grease started dripping off my hands. Honestly, I would compare the \"burger\" part of my sandwich to any old fast food place but priced much higher. We also had seasoned fries which were good and onion rings which were not. The size of the order of onion rings for the price was NOT a bargain at all.\n\nSo I'm glad I finally tried Blake's but I really don't think I'll be back. Especially when the green chile double cheeseburger I had at Whataburger was actually better but then again, my judgement on that one may have been clouded by a hangover.",

    "text": "We had our wedding reception at the Rusty Pelican and the food was wonderful! The view is nice, the service was fantastic. Our favorite dish was the escargot. Unfortunately, it is no longer on the menu which is a shame because the menu lacks in originality.\n\nFast forward a couple years and we are back. The Key West Shrimp was pretty good with a tangy marmalade sauce, and I would recommend it even though it doesn't hold a candle to the escargot.\n\nMy earlier point about the menu lacking originality lead me to try the \"new\" burger on the menu. I had tried everything else that looked interesting in the past. If I'm spending $75 for dinner, I expect that the interesting sounding burger will have a little flare and creativity to it. Maybe this is just because I've experienced an amazing, truly gourmet burger but this is where The Rusty Pelican fell on its face. Out came a medium rare, thin/normal burger patty with two strips of bacon and some crispy onions. No sauces, not cut in half, no presentation and to top it all off, it was served with Sysco Food System steak fries. For a place that boasts of its \"in-house aged steaks\" and \"made fresh risotto\" one would think The Rusty Pelican would approach everything on the menu with the same pride. To say the least, I was very disappointed. Anyone can get the same meal at Five Guys (and the fries would actually taste good).\n\nMy wife had the Cioppino Exquisite which she liked. No complaints there, though she remarked that it did not blow her away.\n\nAfter dinner we enjoyed a Cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e which tasted great! However, Chris, our waiter, lit it at our table with a cigaret lighter. No class, TRP.. :/ No class. It's fun to watch the alcohol burn, but there wasn't enough of it and most of the top of our dish did not caramelize. Even mushy it was quite delicious.\n\nOne last point: I like water without ice. It's a little strange and I have been accused of being high maintenance with my water (a fair point). When I ask for water without ice and you bring me a cup of water with no ice but refill it by pouring so not as much ice gets through just shows that you don't care.\n\nSummation: Service was lacking, flare was flat, the best food was only good and the new menu lacks creativity. :/ Truly a sad day because we love date nights at The Rusty Pelican to reminisce.",

I've tried a lot of things off their menu and about the only thing I'll order now are the wings, which are much improved from several months ago. They are now bigger and tend to be well cooked, whereas before they were generally overcooked and runty looking. Beer is good and reasonably priced. They have Fat Tire for 2.75/pint. They have a lot of turnover on the wait staff and on a couple of occasions I've walked in to see them surrounded by their friends at the bar. Minus a star for having to hang around them while waiting for my order. \n\nNothing is really disgusting, but nothing is worth ordering twice. Onion rings are forgettable, oysters suck (previous poster Billie got it right...I had almost the exact same story, except substitute Louisiana for Texas), burgers are very average, they don't serve crab legs anymore, Po Boys are a joke, salads aren't anything special, and their appetizers aren't appetizing. Chili is OK, but they keep changing the amount they give you for 3.95. It used to be quite generous, but now they put your chili in a square shaped container. I don't understand: it's a sort of soup, and they're serving it like it's a bag of french fries. They also charge .50 cents for everything. Want onions on your chili? 50 cents. Cheese? Another 50 cents. Jalapenos? ANOTHER 50 CENTS. I stopped ordering the chili. \n\nMy suggestion? Wait until Wednesday or Saturday and get their .50 cent wings. Or drink their beer and walk over to Med Cuisine or over to Cross Corner Grill if you want decent bar fare.",

Most of the sushi roll menu contained seared or fried fish and very little raw fish. The sushi and sushimi menu was tiny and left a lot to be desired. We got a lobster bisque that was terrible. To the point that I wondered if the chef ever tasted it before putting it on the menu. A roll called mango passion didn't even have a mango taste, and had ingredients in it that were so incongruent that the taste was bizarre. The simple rolls were ok, but tasted like any other sushi place. Also ordered a fried green tea ice cream. Nope. Didn't have that. Only had chocolate, strawberry and vanilla fried ice cream. The crust fell apart instantly. It was cold. The ice cream should have been melting a bit on the outside from the outer crust being fried, but given that this desert was probably sitting in the freezer, it was rock solid. They're supposed to fry it quickly once ordered. \nEven lowering my high standards of culinary experience I cannot give this place more than 2 stars based on food alone. It's a popular place and people do seem to like it. In my opinion it's probably because they don't venture out past the burbs.",

    "text": "I'll start by saying that the food is excellent for the most part here. I absolutely love the coconut Thai soup. Matter of fact my husband will often just do take out for lunch. But today was a different experience.  I was out and about on a thrift store adventure (so I was dressed in thrift store shopping mode which I believe was part of the reason for the results of my visit) when around noon my son was going to meet me for some lunch at Fulin's (get my fix on the coconut Thai soup, of course). So I called him from the parking lot as I was walking in ( bear with me this is all important) of course he was caught in Providence traffic so I went on into the restaurant. The young man that seated me was sweet and helpful and showed me to my booth and told me my server would be there soon. As time went on I watched a waitress doing her job, I watched a waiter taking care of what looked like take out orders, or whatever, I watched another waiter on the other side doing his job, but I waited ten minutes later still no service at all. So, I called my son briefly to find out that he was just in the parking lot. Finally the take out order guy, or whatever he he was doing came over to me. That's where it got interesting. He said can I help you. I will admit I was a little tired of waiting. I said, Yes I've been here a while, he then with out a smile, or an apology said, well, I was waiting for you to get off your phone. So, I tried to tell him I wasn't on the phone, I had been waiting for more than ten minutes before I briefly called to see where my son was, and he said.... No, you were on your phone. Now, we know that it's not the concern of a waiter to tell me to get off my phone or to inform me of anything. So as to keep the redneck in me calm, I said, that's it and I got up and left. Bottom line the food just doesn't make up for the horrendous service, I'll be headed back to Hermitage to Dusit Thai their food is awesome and their servers always serve with a smile!",

We wouldn't have gone here ourselves, but we received a gift card and so we wanted to give it a try. \n\nFirst of all, it took a while before our waitress took our order for drinks. I felt slightly ignored. \n\nWe went on and ordered the calamari as a starter which was just ok. For our main course we ordered the Buddha's feast (vegetables), the Mongolian beef and the honey chicken. I thought it was one of the worst American Chinese foods I've ever eaten. There was no flavor to be found, and the beef was overcooked. The vegetables were ok, though they used too much ginger for my taste. \n\nAfter we finished our main course, it took ages for our table to be cleaned up. We wanted to get to dessert to get rid of the blandness of the main course! \n\nWe eventually ordered the banana spring rolls and the caramel cake. Both were good! \n\nAfter dessert, our waitress was nowhere to be found (again!). We had to ask someone else to bring our check. \n\nWould not come back here. I'd say there's better American Chinese food at the mall!",

So much for southern hospitality.\n\nOnce we finally got a table, I was at least looking forward to some good food, but the menu was a bit hit or miss. The coffee tasted like instant coffee. My friend got a crawfish meal, which was good. But my eggs were a bit underwhelming, and the \"steak\" in the steak and eggs my friend ordered was basically a bland hamburger patty. The place had some good moments, including a friendly waiter, but the bad parts far outweighed the good for us.

    "text": "Bully's all have the sports bar theme and they all have a plethora of TV's all playing different sports channels; there really isn't much else to say about the atmosphere but then again atmosphere isn't really why people go to Bully's.  I stopped in with my gal pals to take advantage of their happy hour which includes $3.50 screwdrivers and bloody Mary's, which are massive and not light on the liqueur.  We all ordered off of the happy hour menu which had 16 options for $6 dollars apiece.  Their regular menu is also massive so there is sure to be something to satisfy just about anyone. \n\nWe ordered zucchini sticks and jalapeno popper for appetizers.  There wasn't really anything special about the jalapeno poppers; there was no spice to them at all.  I'm the type that likes my stuff mild but this was no spice at all!  The zucchini sticks were good and I liked the size, they were more like a big French fry size which made them easier to share.  The zucchini wasn't especially impressive but anything deep fried is usually good.\n\n I ordered the beef sliders with a salad.  Two of my girlfriends got the chicken fingers and another got the chicken Philly.  Mine was certainly the best presentation; it was the best part about the meal too.  My sliders were served on Hawaiian rolls which were good but the patties were actually one hamburger patty cut into four pieces which I thought was really lame... If you're going to serve a slider at least make individual patties for it or don't even bother.  The hamburger was also really dry and had to be doused in mayo and ketchup in order to be eaten without choking.  The salad was good.  My girlfriends that got the chicken fingers were happy with them but I could tell that they probably came frozen and all Bully's did was fry them.  The chicken Philly was definitely the least impressive meal; the chicken was left in huge, tough, chunks and there was mention of quite a bit of gristle which is a deal breaker for me.   My friend picked at it a little but ended up eating hardly any of it.\n\nThe service was fine overall; no extra points for great service and no deducts for bad service either.  I would recommend going to Bully's for the great drink specials.  If you are going to get food stick with anything fried; Bully's doesn't get any extra points for being special or unique. The food had a good price but I can't say I would want to pay more than $6.00 for it.\n\nIf you want to see any other places I've reviewed check out my blog at: http://jparkhurst07.wordpress.com/",

Blended like baby food. Not a lot of selection.\nThere were no labels on the food at the buffet.\n\nTo say the least, this place did not satisfy my craving (nor my fiance's) for good Indian food and we will not be back.\n\nI can only assume that the people who rave about this place have not had the fortune to eat TRULY mind-blowing, mouth-watering high quality Indian food.",

Not a very impressive beer selection...and pretty hefty on the pricing.  The oysters came out and were excellent.  This was my first time doing raw oysters and I was impressed...but then again, it's pretty hard to screw up raw oysters....guess I'll give more credit to the Gulf of Mexico on that one.  Next, for my meal, I ordered the duck confit and white bean cassoulet with bacon and sausage.  The meal came out and I first went for the duck wing.  It was simply roasted with some seasonings.  Very tender and very good tasting.  Of course, it seems pretty hard to screw this up too.  I'll give more credit to the duck.  Next came the garlic sausage.  This was not good.  It was a giant six inch long sausage, about 1.5 inches in diameter....just a giant chunk of meat that didn't have much taste.  It was overall pretty bland.  I don't know where the garlic they were talking about is in it.  Next was the smoked bacon.  It was more of a bacon cube.  Just a fatty piece of pork belly....which was almost all fat.  Not impressive.  Last came the white bean cassoulet.  This was also very unimpressive.  I'm not sure what seasonings they added to this or if they added any at all.  It was just white beans with cheesy/mooshy tasteless stuff in between topped with breadcrumbs.  Very, very unimpressive.  Overall, I was very unimpressed with this place, especially considering the reviews and prices.  You're better off getting a few Krystal burgers on Bourbon...yes, I am serious.",

    "text": "This restaurant was recommended by a friend. I checked out their website and signed up for their email club. After receiving a $25 discount we decided to try it. \nWe made a reservation for 8pm on Friday night and it really wasn't necessary. The restaurant was maybe  half full when we arrived. Nice ambiance and music. Typical dark wood steak house. There is a nice patio area but it is located next to the mall entrance. \nOur server was very friendly and we ordered a drink while we scanned the menu. Drinks were tasty and the top shelf alcohol drove the prices a little high. \nMy husband and I both decided on the filet combos. He chose a crab cake and I chose the scallops. The food arrived in a timely manner and it was hot. The crab cake was large with nice solid chunks of lump crab. I was surprised to see the scallops were the size of quarters and maybe an inch thick. Although small, they were sweet and cooked well. The sides were pablano au gratin potatoes, Sriracha carrots, Yukon mashed and asparagus. They all tasted fine but nothing stood out as amazing. Run of the mill flavor and the veggies were not bright or fresh looking. The steaks were cooked perfectly (just a little under medium) but there was a hard char on one side. What should have been the star of the plate ended up ruining the taste of everything. There was so much seasoning on the steak that it had burned and gave the steak an extremely salty, bitter taste that overpowered everything on the plate. I know that salt is an essential part of cooking a steak but this was just too much for my taste. \nI guess if it weren't for the price I probably would give this restaurant a higher rating. I expect much more from the food when I have a tab of $125 (+ tax and tip) for 2 cocktails and 2 entrees. I could think of a dozen other restaurants in the St Louis area that serve that same meal for less with much better quality. There are better options out there than this mall restaurant.

There is no excuse for a bar/restaurant in this area to turn into what was ostensibly a Giants bar, with only 4 douchebag NYG fans outnumbering Iggles fans in this place. That's really f*ing sad. \n\nI was here for great Phillies playoffs wins this past season, including Halladay's historic no-hitter debut, and it was packed. That was mere weeks ago. What happened in the interim is a mystery, but while I will probably return, you can bet I won't be parking my ass here for future Iggles games. \n\nThankfully, the game turned around and the Gnats fans left with a loss. Still doesn't give this place a pass, though. Two stars. Embrace and support your local roots, G'liff.",

    "text": "This place could have a lot of potential under the right management and with some renovations.  Unfortunately, this place feels as though it is one step away from going out of business.  The positive were the prices.  Decent prices.  The hotel does have some cool architecture but it has been neglected.  The place smells musty.  The rooms are nice though.\n\nIt is kind of sad because I see a lot of potential in this place under some good management.  \n\nThe overall negative was the staff.  Every single person we came into contact with was clueless. It feels like they are running on a skeleton staff. You are always waiting and waiting for someone to help you.  The wait-staff in all areas is slow and confuse. The only good waiter was Michael in the restaurant.  He is very nice and professional.  Ask for Michael if you are eating in.  \n\nThe food was not very good either.  The burgers were overcooked and the calamari was greasy.  The steak was weird and rubbery, but the salmon was decent.  \n\nWith the low prices brings a slightly wild crowd.  The pool gets a little wild on the weekends.  \n\nThe spa could be nice, but the massage prices are way too high.  You can go just down the road for something just as good for half the price.  They charged $170 for an 80 minute massage.  That's about as high as it gets.  The massage was decent but you can find cheaper within walking distance.  Nancy gives a decent massage.  \n\nIf I had extra money and time, I would buy this place and whip it into shape because I see so much potential.  Unfortunately, I would not go back unless it was under new management.  By the end of the trip, it was just too much.  The place was dirty and the staff was bad.  We should have stayed home.",

    "text": "I was torn about whether to give this place one or two stars. Our dining experience was terrible terrible terrible, but you can't beat the location or the open air set up. It really is quite lovely to sit, quietly watching   Jackson Square by that ever-present flickering lamp light. And the interior of the restaurant is lush and lovely and oozes history. It would have been much nicer, of course, to enjoy these things while consuming, say, drinks, or food. After a certain point, I might even have settled for the smallest acknowledgment from any employee.\n\nSadly, that was not in the cards for us. I'll spare you the details but the gist is that we sat, totally ignored by all the staff, for far longer than is acceptable. Once we were noticed, we waited far too long for drinks and food. The service was terrible terrible terrible. \n\nThe food (we both had red beans, rice, and sausage) was fine, though there was something slightly funky about the parsley garnish. Nothing outstanding, but I wasn't expecting outstanding. Given the size, location, and menu, I was betting on some adequate, tourist grade food, which is exactly what we got. \n\nSo, ultimately two stars for the location, ambiance, and the fact that the food is not terrible. But there is not a chance in hell that I would go back. You can find something better.",

    "text": "So I usually hate Yelp reviews that rant about the service. Because, I honestly think that if you're a true food lover, you wouldn't give a rats behind about service. Really good food speaks for itself. And it you wanted to be a big baby and spoon feed, you would have went to your mama's place. So with that aside, let's talk about Germantown Pub.\n\nFood isn't good. Everything I've had here has been frozen and reheated/refried. From the fries to the catfish to the chicken tenders. Nothing here is made fresh in-house. So expect things to be overseasoned and oversalted to cover up for lack of freshness. And let's not forget how dry the food usually is. Like your great aunt's cooch, this food hasn't been moist in ages. \n\nThe real insult to injury was the service our group received tonight. Our group of 12 came here for trivia which is actually really fun. And we're not the standard a-holes that move from our original seats, make tons of modifications to the menu and confuse our server. \n\nSo, I was pretty freaking shocked when the server asked me what \"number you were\" like I was cattle or standing in line at the DMV when I tried to order another beer. When I asked her to clarify, she stated \"I gave you a number when you sat down.\" Um no, you didn't because I would have actually asked you what you mean by number. I've worked in to service industry before so I understand large groups may be difficult but ultimately it's your JOB to remember who orders what. Blaming the customer for your lack of memorization makes the experience uncomfortable for everyone involved. She also claimed my friend's food would \"be here in a moment\" then 20 minutes later came back and accused him of never ordering it in the first place. Like seriously, we all heard him order it and then heard you confirm his order...twice. She also told me \"don't get the Thai sauce on the chicken tenders...it's terrible.\" so I went with plain chicken tenders and just honey mustard on the side. But guess who ends up with the terrible Thai sauce on her chicken tenders, this girl. But I didn't even bother to send it back and ate my dry Thai sauced chicken tenders anyways because you can tell when things just weren't going ever be rectified. Also, not to the server's fault but due poor planning, ALL BUT ONE of the happy hour draft beers was available going into the 1st hour of trivia. Like, you guys didn't realize that as a bar on an event night you may want to have more beer available?\n\nShort summary is, come here for the trivia and good company. Expect the happy hour beer to run out. Avoid the long red-headed server. And eat dinner elsewhere beforehand.",

We arrived @ about 10:00 AM, and the line was down 21st Avenue about 100 feet. We waited for about an hour to get inside. If you go to Pancake Pantry, expect it. When we got through and left about 12:30 PM, the line was still about 50 - 75 feet down 21st Avenue.\n\nQuite frankly, I'm not sure why local people & others crave Pancake Pantry. The food is OK, it's a decent breakfast, but it's also over priced for the quality and quantity. I've had better & more pancakes, eggs, and meat, etc... at Cracker Barrel and other restaurants. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the breakfast. But, the quality and quantity is definitely not up to the hype. The sentiment for the other 3 people was about the same.\n\nThe service we received was exceptional. The waitress was on the ball, serving us coffee when we needed it, got our orders properly right, and kept making sure we were being treated properly.\n\nThe total bill including tax and tip was $62.00 for 4 people.",

This is more like corporate fast food trying to imitate authentic. First of all they bill themselves as \"healthy\". So this seems to mean they do not serve fries with the meals but very salty potato chips instead. I ordered the gyros plate. First big sin is that the gyros is fried on a grill and not off the spit like a real gyros should be. What a joke. The meal overall was not very filling. I also tried the lemon chicken rice soup which is a staple for this type of cuisine. It was lame to say the least. A poor example of what seemed like canned soup. So after spending 17 bucks on what was a lame representation of this type of cruisine I left here telling myself never again.",

I had tilapia and my husband had mahi, with sides of spinach and garlic mashed potatoes which were all very good.  As soon as I put my fork down, the waitress swooped behind me and took the plate away while my husband was still eating.  She never asked if I was finished.

Several visible empty tables, and a closed patio on a beautiful Saturday night. I will say it did rain for 15 minutes earlier that day. As we waited in the hostess area, dodging employees rolling overflowing trash cans and food trolleys thru, we noticed a table right next to the hostess stand that could fit 6 to 7 people easily. It had a small gap between the 4 top and the 2 top. I told the hostess we could be flexible.  She didn't seem interested in seating us there. As we approached the 40 minute mark she told us she could seat us. I'll leave it to your imagination as to where she sat us. Yes the same table that had been vacant the entire time. Our server, Denise ? , was very punctual and efficient you could tell she was very busy.  The food arrived quickly. It was at best ok.  My ribs were dry and Luke warm and the sausage was cold but tasty. Here is the upside the atmosphere was great.

From the start our waitress was a bit off. She didn't know the size of the signature drinks (one would assume the $10 drink might be smaller than the $28 one. But it might just be the liquor). After we decided on our food, we were told the items we were considering were sold out (would of been nice to not get our hopes set and then be told it was sold out). Ordered the custom guacamole and red snapper ceviche. The guacamole is the only thing that made this review a 2 star review. I've made ceviche many times before. There was a very strong fish taste that not the guacamole, drinks or my entree could remove. Even as I write this I feel like I licked fish scales. GF got the salad which was bleh, dressing was bland. I got the short rib tacos. Short rib tasted like they took it out of a pot roast dish (no mexican seasoning) and the taco was impossible to hold as it was just too wet with the corn/cream topping. Our waitress never once came over to ask how the apps or even the entree were. But again, guacamole was good, if that's all you're looking for.",

Also they had a distinct flavor like they were previously cooked and just reheated. I did order the eggplant with the crawfish sauce and it was pretty good. My husband had the stuffed Mirliton and I could not eat it. There was way too much seasoning in it. My son has gumbo and a shrimp pinky. He said it was good. The service was okay.",

    "text": "The excitement of this place has built as we anticipated a nice bbq place in the historic main street area. So, we went about a month after they opened to get some of their brand new restaurant issues out of the way. \n\nIt was a Sunday afternoon. We were one of 4 tables seated. The inside and the outside both have this amazing industrial feel that we love. So, that is a definite plus. The waitress was extremely nice, when we actually saw her. The manager brought the whole crew together for quite some time to do some sort of meeting while we were still waiting on our first drink. I think there could have been a better time to organize this meeting than leave tables waiting. Unfortunately, the service did not seem to be any better after the meeting and like I mentioned, they were not busy at all. \n\nOn to the food, My fiance and I ordered the 'pulled pork turnovers' for an appetizer. They definitely set the bar high for the rest of the meal. btw--still waiting on my beer flight (sampler) at this time. Finally the main course is served.   We ordered a 'slab of ribs' and a 'pick 3 w/brisket, turkey, pulled pork'. We also had the macaroni, french fries, and green beans for sides. I could break down the description of all of these; but to save you time. I would only order the pulled pork and the french fries again. The rest of the food was dry and/or had no flavor at all. On to dessert, we had pecan pie. Pretty sure it was thawed our store bought from the local grocery.\n  \nThis brings us to price. We spent $64 before tip on food that we did not even finish due to taste not full bellies. Everything is ala carte, so it gets pricey in a hurry. I could not imagine the bill of the family with 3 kids sitting next to us. It is a bbq joint; but have definitely had better.\n\nWill return for their drink menu one evening; but the food will be left to the rest of the customers.\n\nNeeded info:\nService--friendly; but MIA most of the meal\nFood--mediocre at best; except for the pulled pork.\nDrinks--the beer flight and it was excellent, will return for drinks only\nAtmosphere--awesome",

The prices are reasonable, and the beer selection although not extensive, is very well selected. (A trend of Kimpton hotel restaurants). \n\nThe problem for me was the service. Although upon being flagged, the staff was friendly and proficient, there was very little initiative. There needs to be a happy medium of attentiveness, but not too the point where annoyance or over-bearing takes effect.\n\nThe truffle popcorn was good, but the butter wasn't very well distributed. Each small handful had a different taste. The pork confit quesadillas were very impressive, and were accompanied with a smokey chipotle dipper that really maximized the taste of the confit.",

    "text": "A sister restaurant of St. Elmo Steakhouse, and named after its original owners, the fairly-new Harry & Izzy's is another fine dining option in downtown, located in the Circle Center mall. While related to one of the finer restaurants in Indy (St. Elmo's), my only experience here was not positive. I will give them a break, as they had a large group, who had rented out the upstairs, but aside from a long wait, the service was poor, and the food was average at best, for the price. \n\nI ordered salmon, and we also had a pizza. The menu was simple, and included the St. Elmo signature shrimp cocktail. \n\nI have a feeling that the restaurant normally offers up a much better meal, and the place is nice, but this particular day (it was during lunch on a Saturday) was bad. As well, my party and I were quite cold, and were told that the heat is centrally controlled by the mall, so they could not control their climate as well as they would have liked. Apparently the owners were looking into the installation of some baseboard heating, which certainly would have helped, although I cannot confirm that this was done. \n\nI hope to give this place another shot sometime, as I think I just hit it on a bad day. If not, my guess is they will not last too long.",

After all that, my smoked salmon Benedict was almost inedible.  English muffin that was twice as big as what was on top of it, a tablespoon of shredded salmon with wilted spinach, and the sorriest excuse for hollandaise sauce I have ever seen. The menu indicted a Dijon hollandaise but this was the consistency of water. So thin and watery I couldn't even taste it. I never do this, but I actually considered sending it back...

    "text": "Though deterred by the name \"Something's Fishy\" for a restaurant that serves fish, my friend and I still chose to come to this restaurant as it appears to be the only place with tapan tables in all of Santa Barbara and we were really craving fresh fried rice. We called 24 hours in advance and made a reservation for two for the tapan tables for the next evening at 7:30 PM. Upon arriving promptly at 7:30 we were first ignored for 5 to 10 minutes at the door before finally being escorted to our table, where we were seated with two other parties, two couples, one of which was clearly expecting a third person. After waiting for a waitress to arrive to take our order for over 20 minutes, a frowning teenager finally arrived and asked if we were all ready to order. The woman that belonged to the party of three that was still waiting for their third quickly responded that no, she was not ready to order because their third friend had not arrived and the waitress promptly put away her notepad and left the table. WHAT?! Apparently because this group of strangers was not ready to order, the rest of us had to wait to eat. After the third of their party finally arrived at approximately 8PM, half an hour after our reservation time, we were finally able to order. My friend and I chose to order both tapan and sushi, and when the waitress asked if we would like our sushi roll while we were waiting for the chef we said we would. We received no sushi in the next 25 minutes while waiting for the chef to arrive, but rather the roll arrived towards the end of our meal. Overall, the chef was very nice and the food was what I expected of any adequate tapan restaurant. After finishing our meal, we had to beg the waitress several times to finally deliver our check, at this point it was around 9:30PM, we had been at the restaurant for two hours, and were completely exhausted. When she finally delivered it, we were displeased to see that she had charged us full price for our sushi, despite the restaurant's advertisement for half-off sushi during the time we were there.\n\nI will probably return here, but only because it is the only establishment in the entire city with tapan tables. The service is horrible.",

This is the best of the Schnucks in the city itself, although I have to admit that the bar is pretty low right there. The staff is pleasant compared to the staff at any other city Schnucks, which again is not really that hard to accomplish.\n\nThe selection of merchandise could be much better, for instance good luck finding any of the store brand soda in diet, apparently the locals don't care if they are 300+ lbs, as the managers tell me there is no demand for it. The deli is borderline awful and they do a spectacular job of having all of the gristle and fat hidden in the pre-sliced lunchmeat, you figure that out when you get home and you have enough real meat to make a half a sandwich and enough byproduct to feed your cat for several days. Also be sure to check the expiration date on dairy before you buy as I have gotten milk and yogurt home several times to find it days or weeks out of date.\n\nThe weirdest part about this place is the cast of derelicts that loiter there daily yet are not escorted off the premises. To the contrary, they seem welcomed, one even wears a Schnucks jacket in the colder months as he panhandles, sifts half smoked cigarette butts out of the butt disposal out front and shuffles about the store looking creepy. Perhaps characters like this are considered quaint by the locals, but they illustrate why I left for south county back in the day.",

But I notice a lot of empty shelves. Examples: no oatmeal in the bulk section, no baguettes at all yesterday, half empty milk section, and a generally understocked appearance. Perhaps this is Amazon's way of trying to stock just the minimum, but they're not even doing that. Also, the rewards program is not nearly as good as it once was. Maybe these are growing pains, but so far not impressed.",

Everything else about the experience was pretty mediocre. The place has potential, but needs several major improvements. Service was TERRIBLE. The waitress seemed irritated with my questions about the wine list, ignored our basic requests (like salt and pepper, water refils, etc.), and seemed to rush us out without even offering dessert (which i am pretty sure is what they are known for and what we originally came for, but I guess not tonight since she couldn't be bothered). I could bore you with all the nitty gritty details, but I was unimpressed from start to finish. Plus, their live music was pretty abysmal. With so many similar, better options in St. Louis, don't waste your time or money at blondies.",

Part of the problem is the plethora of better bars nearby, most notably Good Dog, Monk's, Tangier, and, of course, McGlinchey's.  Another issue: hostess seating in the main room at all times - why?  It's a bar, just let people come in, get a beer, and sit where they find a seat.\n\nBut the bigger problem is the clientele.  Not exactly a neighborhood (or city) crowd.  For whatever reason this place draws an \"older\" crowd, and not in a good way.  And when the crowd is younger, it seems as though all of them crossed the Ben Franklin Bridge to get there.\n\nFood: american cheese in the Quesadilla is never, never ok. Let that be your indication.\n\nLong story short: there's better bars.",

    "text": "Very cute place; I forgot I was in Indy for a while. My mom took me for a tea and thought it would be $55 ($65 with champagne), but it was $65 PER PERSON!!!! The tea cost us $130 and that didn't even include the tip. While the tea, food and service were lovely, we were devastated by the cost. And honestly we only got one type of tea and the sandwiches weren't as good as the other tea houses we've been to. The candies were good, but not worth $130! Who pays that!? We were splurging for a $65 tea. My mom is 74 and was not clear about the description on the website. She took me, so I hadn't screened the information for her first. Everywhere else in town is $50 or less for a tea for two (and we have been to every tea house in town) so she just assumed it was for two. How could it be twice as much as every other tea house in town!? Please do not make the same mistake that she made. It really hit us hard at the end and was very difficult for both of us to believe and know that this happened to her. She didn't say anything to the business, because she felt like it was her fault. But as nice as it is there, it was not worth $130+ for tea. \n\nVisit this place for the experience. It's a very cute place and the cakes looked amazing (not part of our tea), but unless you have a very fluid budget, do not do the tea experience. I am devastated that my mom & I paid that much for a tea. So sad. I even contacted them to talk about how it was confusing and my mom was devastated by the cost and no one replied. I was not expecting them to refund something, though that would have been nice, but even just to say they heard me and would make the website more clear. Frustrating.",

My tempura roll has no tempura, but the real problem was the seaweed wrappers were so strong and overbearing I could not enjoy the flavor of the fish.

I love authentic Mexican and was really hoping that get that experience here.\n\nWe drove up and walked in. Can't say there is anything particularly special about the building and/or decoration. Bland, awkward layout. I ordered a carne seca breakfast burrito, chips/salsa and got a horchata. They gave my the drink right away and I sat down. Started drinking my horchata and wasn't impressed. Pretty sure Kern's has a better mix than this - not much flavor at all.\n\nSadly, I continued to sit there for another 20 minutes before getting my burrito or my chips. I understand that food takes time, but I've been to enough fast Mexican food places to know it shouldn't take that long and if all else, they could have at least given me the chips and salsa (which was really just red sauce, not salsa). Once I finally had a chance to eat the burrito, it wasn't good. Bland - not even sure it was carne seca, at least in my opinion.\n\nNeedless to say this play is ok at best. Not very flavorful or memorable.",

    "text": "I really wanted to like this place and heard about it during lent when I had given up meat. I found myself in the area again and decided to give it a try. I usually don't write reviews until I've been to a place a few times but I think my experience was a complete one. I ordered the special and sampled each type of chicken, the modern BBQ sauce, mac&cheese (which the woman behind the counter was very proud of), \na bananas foster pie, and the new hope birch beer. After finishing everything, I just wanted my $16.20 back. Individual reviews: \n\nThe chicken: It was very average and that is being generous. It wasn't incredibly flavorful but it wasn't dry so it could have been worse. \n\nThe sauce: It had the tang of a traditional North Carolina BBQ sauce, mustard and vinegar based. I can't eat mayo so I was limited with sauce choices but the mayo sauces were recommended. \n\nThe mac&cheese: Salty and mediocre. It combines all of the things I like but makes a mess doing it. The pasta was well cooked but the cheese and bacon combo made it taste like I just licked salt off of my hand without the nice shot of tequila after. \n\nThe bananas foster pie: The crust of the pie needs no improvement but the filling could use an overhaul. I use the term filling loosely because after biting into the flakey crust, I struggled to find the bananas. There was a thin layer of smashed bananas and cinnamon sugar at the bottom and 75% of the interior was empty space. \n\nThe new hope soda: The birch beer (the actual name of the soda escapes me at the moment but it is birch beer) was the highlight of my meal. Everything you would expect from a Pennsylvania birch beer and very refreshing, which surprised me because I normally don't like fountain sodas and prefer root beer.\n\nI gave this place 2 stars instead of 1 because nothing was horrible.  I think the concept works, the decor is nice, and the menu is good but they need to work on the quality of their food because it currently doesn't match the cost.",

    "text": "The family units and I decided to try Hendrick's because... well, you know... BBQ :)\n\nWe were greeted and seated quickly as they were not busy at the time we arrived.  \nTIP: Check in via Yelp and receive a free appetizer!  \n\nWe did so and ordered the fried green tomatoes and the cornbread.  The tomatoes were just a hair too thick which made them a bit tougher than I'm used to.  Plus they had pretty thick breading on them.  Taste was just ok.  I've certainly had better elsewhere.  The accompanying sauce had a decent flavor.\nThe cornbread is on the sweeter side, and had a good flavor - albeit dry.  More of an opportunity to slather on some of the honey butter that accompanied the order along with some honey Chipotle sauce.... let me warn you now, the Honey Chipotle is quite spicy.\n\nOn to the meat! \n\nI ordered the 'Pick Three Sampler' at a price of $24.  I chose baby backs, pulled pork, and brisket.  Let's break it down:\nBaby Backs - Good flavor, moist, good dry rub and smoke, but the portion was quite skimpy. 3 ribs which were no more than 2 1/2 inches in length.  Pulled pork was moist, larger chunks/not shredded, but again... maybe a small handful portion at best.  Brisket was sliced thinner than it should've been as it lost its moisture.  It had a very slight smoke ring which did not translate into much flavor.  Portions included 3 small slices about 5-6 inches in length.  Sides ordered were sweet potato fries and cole slaw.  Fries were great, but the cole slaw was very bitter and inedible - perhaps some ingredients were missed?\n\nAnother order at the table was the pulled pork sandwich.  This came with a better portion size, but it was dwarfed by the huge bun and massive pile of cole slaw on top.\n\n4 sauces are on the table: Sweet, House, STL, and Hot.  Sweet - very sweet with a heavy molasses base - good flavor.  House - vinegar base with a punch.  STL - another vinegar base with a strong cayenne flavor.  Hot - I didn't even attempt this one - haha.\n\nOverall, I'd say it was overpriced for the quality and quantity received.  I would pay their asking price if it was amazing BBQ, but I was not all that impressed.  Would I go back? Perhaps.  Would I go out of my way for it? No.",

I ordered a cheesesteak and that was also a little bland, I think it would have been better if there was more cheese and grilled onions.

The dessert I had (can't remember what it was) was absolutely disgusting.\n\nAfter reading all the positive yelp reviews, we went back last night to give it a second chance. Thai iced teas were great. The crispy pork spring rolls were delicious, with a great pork flavor (though the crispy spring rolls at Vietnam Cafe are similar and much better). The grilled mixed vegetables with peanut sauce were bland, but the peanut sauce was excellent. I bet the chicken satay is good.  \n\nWe were really thinking that we were in for a good dinner until the entrees came. Not only did it take FOREVER for our entrees to come, but they were terrible! We got the pad thai (again, to see if it would be better), but it was exactly the same: bland. Pad Thai is supposed to burst with the flavors of tamarind, fish sauce, bean sprouts, and peanuts. This didn't burst at all.  After reading great things about the crazy pineapple fried rice, I went for it, but it was bad too: the pineapple was absolutely delicious, but didn't go well with the flavor of the fried rice, which was bland and vaguely unpleasant.\n\nWe paid $50 with tip for 2 entrees, 2 appetizers, and 2 thai iced teas. \n\nAs we left, I suggested we only come here again for appetizers. We decided to just not come again.\n\nMake the trek out to Silk Cuisine in Bryn Mawr! Best Thai in the area, hands down.",

Mine came with two containers of salad dressing, but  they were each only 1/4 full, if that.

I had asked for \"extra\" cucumbers, which have always come thinly sliced on the top of the salad at every other Panera I have been to.

We paid $10.00 to taste 5 different wines and decided to sit out on the patio to enjoy the music with our wine.  Apparently we weren't supposed to do that.  The hostess came out and told that most tables were reserved and we should have checked in with her.  Sorry - didn't know that and it was actually surprising as the tables never did fill up.  The wait staff proceeded to ignore us as we sat there.  We are people that dine out on a regular basis and we know good customer service.  Maynards needs some help in that area.  We finally were given menus but by that time Maynards had gotten all of the money they were going to get from me.  Best part of the night was the Keeling Schaffer wine and pizza at Empire.",

Raised up, lights that move around, good sound system, a fog machine, and a pretty big dance floor. \n\n\nBut their food service.... crappy both times Ive been there. \n\nThe last time I was there I walked in, hadn't been greeted by anyone at the empty front podium, and just found a table. I figured once I sat down Id wait for an employee to get back to the menus and go up and ask for one. So I saw a lady working up at the front and went up and asked her.  She said that they stopped serving food at...... I cant remember if it was 9 or 10 pm.... but she gave me a certain time that the kitchen closed. I went back to my table and looked at the time. It was 10 minutes before the time she told me the kitchen closed. I thought that was kinda dumb, but oh well.... maybe they stopped taking orders 10 minutes ahead or something. The next thing I see the SAME EXACT LADY seat four people RIGHT NEXT to our table and give them menus. Then she takes their order, and brings out their food. All I wanted were some freakin french fries and I had to sit there and watch the people who got there long after me eating french fries instead. RUDE!",

Idk....but the sip I did have was tasty. \nI'm vegetarian so I went for the black bean tacos...beans were bland. Which is disrespectful to Goya. I bought an appetizer, some foolishness called bubble bread. Don't get caught up in the alliteration like I did. It's garlic bread with some shredded parmesan on it. If that's what you want, go for it, but it tasted like frozen bread that was popped in a toaster oven. \nOtherwise...the server was kind. \nThis place is designed for college students. They will eat and drink anything. \nIn closing...Copa = Tom Foolery\n2 stars cause at least they bring the booze to you fast. Only waited 3 minutes for my drink.",

    "text": "The food was terrible.  The service was excellent and the ambiance is very nice.  The wine, beer and bar lists are stunning in quality and breadth.\n\nWell, really just one dish was terrible and the others were Okay.  We started with the fried mozerella which was beautifully cook and presented, but seriously lacking in seasoning.  I then had the carpaccio which was absolutely lovely (although this is not a difficult dish to \"cook\", it was perfectly presented.  For our \"mains\" we both ordered small because we have small appetites.  I got a half portion of the butternut squash pasta, which was the day's special.  The filling was nice, the pasta was definately homemade.  But it was presented swimming in olive oil and had a sort of grittiness to it that felt like sand in your teeth.  Burnt cinnamon maybe?  My date ordered the mushroom risotto and his dish was pretty much unedible.  It was possibly the most bland thing I have every tasted and the risotto was woefully undercooked, crunchy.  While you could see it had lots of mushrooms in it, there was absolutely no mushroom flavor.  Not sure if that is quality of ingredients or preparation.  He asked for salt (so confident are they in their dishes that it is not on the table), but no amount seemed to help.\n\nWarning to those who favor quanitity over quality - the potions sizes are QUITE small here.  Half portion really is an appetizer size.  And the appetizers really are appetizers.  Personally I find this highly refreshing as so many italian restaurants seem to be into serving food for five as a single entree and I hate wasting food.",

    "text": "Eek.  I'm going to have to disagree with James on this one.  I just went to Limoncello for the first time this weekend and am at a loss as to why it's so popular.  Despite our reservations, we waited 20 minutes for a table.  Another group that showed up after us without reservations was offered an outside table -- not sure why this wasn't offered to us as an option?  I guess because it was cold out they just made an assumption that we wouldn't want it?\n\nOnce inside (which was deafening!) they gave us two small slices of bruschetta.  I thought this was to make up for the wait, but maybe not, because we never got a basket of bread like all of the other tables.  The waitress took our order and disappeared until she came back with our food.  The prices here are *high*!  A basic plate of pasta (we're talking ravioli with marinara sauce) set me back $18.  I guess they can get away with charging so much because they're BYO, but still...and then, when said ravioli actually arrived, it was cold.  That hasn't happened to me in a restaurant in ages, but since I accurately guessed that our waitress wouldn't be back to the table anytime soon, I ate it anyway.  We did order dessert - key lime cheesecake - which was pretty good and saved this from being a one star review.\n\nOne thing Limoncello is famous for is providing a complimentary shot of limoncello to each diner after the meal.  Nice touch, right?  Too bad they ran out of limoncello (their namesake item!!!) before we finished our meal.  I have to say that, unfortunately, I wasn't in the least bit surprised.  I won't be back.",

    "text": "Ninki has all the intentions of trying to serve Japanese food.  However, it falls short of that, amongst other things.\n\nWhile its location is what brought me here, it is not AT ALL what you expect to see when you walk into a Japanese restaurant of any sort.  It looks like a late 80's, early 90's bachelor pad.  Kind of like black laquer threw up on Japan.  No bueno.\n\nThe service was less than decent, considering it was a fair 20 minutes between visits from our waitress, who was extremely hyper and difficult to understand because of it.  Needless to say, we finally chose our Hibachi bowls (shrimp for me, steak for JTR), and then waited our \"alotted\" 20 minutes for the food.  Did I mention we watched a table of four (who ordered before us) get their food 5-10 minutes before us?\n\nThe food smelled great.  I was extremely excited at the look of other people's plates, but when ours arrived, my hopes immediately dropped.  The veggies were covered in butter and oil, and my shrimp was sitting very lonely on the other side of the plate by itself.  A small heap of arugala made a nice wall between the veggies and the shrimp.  The steak looked fairly appetizing, but the plate was also pretty sparse and lonely looking.  At least serve this stuff in smaller plates so it doesn't look so pathetic!  JTRs fried rice tasted like a stick of melted butter.  Luckily, I found the silver lining on the menu: steamed rice.\n\nRecap?  I won't be back.  Proverb of the day: A Japanese restaurant's ability to not screw up a bowl of steamed rice is no reason to return.",

For the grouper, it tasted very done up in that there was tons of sauce and spices that ultimately overpowered the food; in its description it seems tasty. \n\nDon't get the mashed potatoes.

The pretzels soft baked were also great. \n\nThat being said everything else- not so good. We ordered out here and they told us the wait would be about 45-50 minutes. We got there at the 50 minute mark and ended up waiting an additional 45 minutes. The place was not crowded at all which I hear is rare, and the woman who said the food would be right out continued to look at me so she was very aware of my presence. Finally she brought the food out and said \"ops sorry for the wait that was totally my fault\". Cheesy bread was completely burnt and inedible, and pizza was decent I guess, though the sauce wasn't so good. I\"they forgot it in the burner when we were literally the only people waiting on food. I guess people make mistakes but they were not all that apologetic about it especially since I was waiting an extra 45 minutes and my food was burnt to a crisp. It was also expensive.

For food we started with the smoked oysters which were interesting. The bread and butter that came with the food were good too. But then came the entrees. The duck was wayyyyyy oversalted. Clearly the duck was brined but someone lost control of the salt with the rest of the dish.  The breakfast with eggs were requested over easy. One egg was cooked well but the other still had a clear white. The shrimp and grits were oily with grease or butter but the person liked the flavors. The catfish eaters said that it was okay but the rolls were not great. Was the food bad? No. Was the service bad? No. Would any of the six of us go back? No.  \n\nAt the end we heard the couple to my left Complain to the waitress that her eggs weren't cooked. And then the waiter\nBrought over the manager to the table to our right and he said to one of the men  \"I'm sorry your meal wasn't right.\"  We don't know what that issue was. Based on all the other amazing reviews we can only think that either the chef was out of town on Sunday or they have a new chef who needs to be replaced",

    "text": "I've been to Ralph three times over the past few years, and I don't think I'll be going back again.  Bottom line: this place is overpriced.  Case in point in the tomato and mozzarella appetizer.  It's $9.75.  I understand that appetizers and desserts are the place to mark-up prices, and that's fine. These people run a business to make money.  However, I cannot respect a restaurant that gouges its customers.  This particular appetizer is one tomato cut up (prob cost them 50 cents), a few small mozzarella balls, and then a drizzle of balsamic vinaigrette.  A dish that costs them $2-$3 to make should not be priced at $9.75.  Similarly, a bottle of beer, Stella, cost $7.  Furthermore, the menu prices on their website are out of date and misleading.  Another case in point: the veal saltimbocca.  On the website, it's listed as $23.  In the restaurant, however, its $25.  This is one of my favorite dishes because of the prosciutto that is traditionally supposed to cover the veal cutlet.  At Ralph's, there were three tiny bites of prosciutto.  I honestly don't think I was even given one full slice, let alone enough to cover the veal.  \n\nI think Ralph's offers traditional Italian food in a great atmosphere.  However, in a city like Philadelphia where Italian restaurants are a dime a dozen, Ralph's has to do much more to make it worth your while.  The food isn't bad, but it's not great either.  On top of serving lackluster food, they have the nerve to charge an arm and a leg for it.  I can think of at least two other Italian restaurants in the city where the food is better AND cheaper.  Ralph's is the perfect example of a once-great restaurant that is now resting on its laurels and relying on name only.  Try it out if you must, but don't expect to be wowed.",

Half the fries were undercooked while the other half were fine. We spoke to the manager, who apologized and gave us a free pizza coupon. Good show of customer service there. \n\nWell, that free pizza was divine. Another shocking turn in the tale of 312. \n\nRecently, we came in later on a Saturday (1030PM) with five people.

One time, the cook with long, greasy hair and a small trimmed beard did not wash his hands ONCE.  He continually touched the sliders by the sides I guess to make sure they were warm.  But he did it with other sliders. My friends, that's called cross-contamination.  That was one example. They don't wear gloves. The cooks with long hair have their hair exposed.  \n\nI wrote to district about it. They never responded.  Then, I wrote a review with a picture showing the people working putting their shoes on the counter (See Instagram).  However, the review was taken down.  This says a lot about the establishment.  They keep their griddle clean around the kitchen, but I'm sorry, that's not enough. Plus it's unprofessional. These people obviously don't care, because they have swarms of tourists visiting every weekend.  \n\nIf you're kitchen is exposed, you have to own up.

If it's such a problem and hassle I'll pay, that's not the issue. I go to this Starbucks all the time. I don't know what her issue is but she needs to fix it",

    "text": "Recommended by the concierge of the Astor Crowne Plaza.  It was a Thursday night.  We ordered cocktails which took 15 minutes to arrive.  I ordered a Moscow mule which I'm assuming they just didn't know how to make it because it was green colored and had no ginger taste at all.  I then ordered the Frogs Leap Sauvignon Blanc which was practically undrinkable, my husband took a sip and actually shook his head to get it down.  I ordered the Blackened Red Fish which was the most expensive item on the menu and my husband assured me it wound be delicious: Wrong! It was undercooked, slimy and did not appear blackened just mild in spice.  It was actually kind of mushy.  I just couldn't eat it.  They were fairly accommodating, offering me something else, but at this point I was over it.  My husband found his items to be edible but not wonderful.  Sorry Muriel's, for the high end prices, this should be a lot better.  It is in the most touristy of locations so I should have known.  I would not go again.",

Overall, as someone already stated they have great apps but the entrees are left to be desired.\nConsidering each entree costs ~$8, you get what you pay for. I ordered the Pad Thai and it was bad. Way too sweet with no spicy kick to it. We also ordered the Seafood Crispy Noodles, Pearl Noodles, and a Beef rice dish. All were really mediocre. The Indian pancakes and chicken satay apps were great though. Idk why the entrees were so lackluster. I'm sad I didn't enjoy it more but I'm glad the total was cheap for a night out.",

And this chipotle location really never disappoints when it comes to undercooking their rice. They don't know how to cook their rice!!! We gave them several chances and kept coming back hoping it was just a flux but it was not. We just ordered 3 bowls and the rice is completely hard and undercooked. Even my 4yo daughter said, \"it's so crunchy it's like eating seeds\"! That is what broke the camel's back. We are not going back to this chipotle. Unless you enjoy eating raw hard rice, I suggest you don't come here either. I am asian and I eat rice 3 meals a day. So I KNOW my rice.",

It isn't. \n\nWe waited half an hour for our food and when it arrived a few entrees looked like they had been sitting under a heat lamp for awhile. 2 people in our party had fresh looking food and they remarked that it was delicious. Mine however had noodles stuck together and the clams smelled funny. \n\nOur waitress seemed overwhelmed by the amount of tables she had. Drink refills took awhile as well as salad refills. She was very attentive and accommodating at the meals end when she was giving us the check. Trying for the big tip no doubt. \n\nOverall the food was just ok.

There were no complaints in that department. \n\nHowever, I had made reservations for the later seating over a month beforehand. Because of budget stuff and the fact that we live in the suburbs, we really don't get out for things like this often and were really looking forward to a little romantic dinner. We arrived in plenty of time for our reservation. But because of overcrowding, we had to sit communally with two other couples. I wouldn't be so upset about this if we were told ahead of time that there would be a chance of this happening, but they decided after having us sit there in our coats for 10 minutes and didn't really give us a decision in the matter. It really did put a damper on the evening. Luckily, the other two couples were great people and we had some great conversation. And they did serve us as three separate parties of two, so we weren't sharing the plate with a bunch of strangers. \n\nBut then, they decided to include the mandatory 18% for parties of 6 or more despite billing and serving us separately, which was a huge slap in the face. Unfortunately, they lost out, because even when I tip low, I tip more than that.\n\nI love to support smaller businesses and this restaurant is truly unique. But I can't help feel sour about our treatment there. You would think that after being in business for so long, they'd figure out how to handle situations like this. It really is unfortunate.",

Even if you have an issue with Yelp reviews and reviewers, it ain't wise to stumble into a group of 5-7 of them (especially the Elites in your town!), make a few passive-aggressive comments, then hand over your business card and huff away. How does that help the situation? \n\nThere are so many better ways to make things right for patrons, and on a day like Lundi Gras, right before the parade, a different approach might have led to positive new reviews and updates. Instead, it made a pretty bad first impression on me, and the local crew wasn't impressed too much. Sure, I got two more margaritas to go for the parade, but would I go back? Probably not.

The spring rolls here are smaller, there is definitely a lot less meat in the vermecilli noodles dishes, and the seasoning was not as tasty in my opinion.\nI'm glad I also tried something different, the sweet and sour fish, it was pretty good but I think after a while the taste would be pretty strong.  I did really like the veggies in the dish though.\nI couldn't stop thinking about the other place. The flavor, the sizes for the price, and the service at the other place was much better than my experience at Pho An Hoa.",

Every time they are very busy so evidently my taste buds are not as highly evolved as most but too me the burgers just aren't that good and the Truffle fries are worse!! Ordered the Woodstock with Benton bacon and had to look under the cheese to find it! Service has always been good but 20.00 for burger, fries and coke (after tip) is just crazy to get at least in my humble opinion (in the flavor department), a well below average burger and fries.",

The atmosphere is good and very low key.  the service was good, but the fried sea food plater left alot to be desired.  I had catfish, shrimp , oysters, fries, It was all very tastless and left alot to be desired.  I did not even finish my meal that I spent around 25 bucks on.  They really need some kind of seasoning in the batter.  Hate to say If I ever go back it will be a while and deff wont get fried seafood again.",

Lunch plate is $6.50. The one small piece of baked chicken tasted stale and saturated with salt and garlic, the cassava (yuka) was over cooked and mushy. Second time I tried the pulled pork which was a much bigger serving than the chicken but dry and chewy. I wouldn't even attempt to try the fish. I work in the area and we kind of make this place a last option when ordering lunch. There are a couple Latin places near by that serve way better food for around the same price.",

    "text": "So I generally am not particularly critical of restaurants but today this place needs to get this review. My husband and I arrived and were placed on the wait list. No big deal. Some nice person gave us a sample of the deep dish pizza and we quickly changed our minds on what we were going to order. The pizza was no better than Pizza Hut. We were seated and ordered the artichoke dip and a flatbread pizza. The artichoke dip came out. Most of the chips were small pieces. Hardly suitable for dipping. The waitress did not bring us flatware or napkins. She seemed to disappear so we had to flag someone down to get those. The flat bread pizza was something kids could make. On grocery store flatbread and pre fab low cost ingredients.  To me the biggest disappointment was the level of food served for the price. Expected higher quality for the price. The appetizer was sub par at 9 bucks with bits of chips and the grocery store flatbread at 15 bucks was unimpressive. Probably won't go back because there are local non-chain restaurants that are far better.",

I'm going to give the place the benefit of the doubt that it is not always like this as we came in at 10 PM, but if you cannot offer quality food at that hour then don't have your kitchen open. \nAll of our food came out within 5 to 10 minutes of ordering which leads me to believe it was not made fresh. The Caesar salad was room temperature and overdressed. The hush puppies were flavorless, and the chicken wings (3 full wings is a serving) were undercooked and barely warm. The only redeeming food item was the chicken and biscuits, which had a nice flavor profile- the biscuit was again, cold in spots. \n\nOn the positive side the place has a nice hip atmosphere and the service is friendly. \n\nUnfortunately, the food was so sub par we would not consider dining here again.",

My entree was the Shortrib Chilaquiles and what a waste of good flavors it was. The proteins to corn chips was very scant. The egg whites were still translucent.

But even in New York, you get a little more bang for your buck. A grilled cheese is about the cheapest thing you can get on the lunch menu at $5, which isn't horrible, but I'm usually horrified by the prices of wraps and salads, which range from $10-$11. They don't even come with fries, just a small bag of chips and a pickle. I never like eating in a restaurant where I feel like they're pinching every penny, and that is definitely the impression I get here. \n\nPluses are that their breakfasts are a little more reasonable and overall, the waitstaff is pretty child-friendly (though it's gonna cost you a lot for milk).",

When I booked the room it was for 2 people and their \"bay breeze package\" but when I got here I was told the reservation was only for 1 person. This resulted in an additional charge of over $50 to add my daughter back onto the package. Since it was my first time at the hotel and it was their error, I asked if there was a comp- 1 front desk person and 2 supervisors later I was able to get 1 free drink at the bar for a house brand drink. Really? All that work for a $4 glass of wine? When my daughter's cold got worse and then she couldn't use the additional service I just paid for, neither the hotel or the spa would work with us to rebook the service, issue a gift certificate or anything else. The room was ok, nothing special. The hot tub and pool were ok, but creepy later in the evening due to poor lighting and minimal staff.

    "text": "Came here after a Bachelorette party. The place was filled with Sugar bowl Auburn football players getting their fix before curfew and a bunch of weirdos hitting on the customers. It seemed like everyone was fighting over the biscuits. Now these biscuits are covered in butter that looks like glue, but they were a hit, especially if you don't mind clogging your arteries. I know there was nothing healthy in here to eat, but that by far had to be the biggest killer. Hot wings are very saucy and better than the other wings. So, if you want to be entertained or feeling depressed on a late drunken night, try it out. You'll definitely have a good laugh.",

Then yesterday i accidently ordered from here instead of angelinos and i got the buffalo chicken sandwhich and it was just covered in blu cheese and greasy sauce it was so Disgusting.  All their food is terribly greasy and over seasoned its too much.. Back off on it a little and use freasher ingredients it will be much better!\n\nIll also add that their desserts suck, taste bland and a waste of money. Their sodas are usually expired and flat. I hate everything about this place!",

That's usually a good sign, but the room quickly became overcrowded with the line to order and the line to get drinks snaking throughout most of the room. We had two orders under one number at our table. ( you get a # and take a sign to display at your table. ) Well 2/3 of the people got their food within 10-15 min. One chicken BBQ sandwich plate and one pork. I was told that the amount of chicken in the sandwich was disappointing despite the yummy sauce.  The pork sandwich was on the dry side but ok. My nachos arrived around 40 minutes later only after reminding one of the runners twice I never received my food.  The nachos were okay. The pork BBQ was kinda dry but the sauces available were good. \nI plan to try this place again soon but so far I am less than impressed. Parking can be an issue also of note.",

    "text": "- Did Not Meet My Expectations -\nTwo of my daughters and I treated my mother to lunch on the patio at Upland yesterday. My mother is hearing impaired so we try to choose locations on the quieter side to enhance her dining experiences. We also checked the menu online first to ensure a variety of salad choices as that is my mother's go-to menu item.\nMy middle daughter and I visited Upland for a beverage just a couple of weeks prior; it was a Sunday afternoon and the patio was delightful and quiet. Unfortunately, this visit was anything but quiet or delightful. \nUpon arrival were seated on the patio -- there were other tables occupied with ladies having lunch (looked close to my age), young parents with a baby, and others. That said, I was confused by the rock music blaring from the patio speakers. I tried to let it go, but after 10 minutes had gone by and we're still challenged trying to have conversations at our table, I went inside and asked the bartender (only staff member I could find) to please turn down the patio music as it was difficult for us to hear our own conversations. He seemed agreeable, but I seriously doubt the music was modified; if it was, it was marginal at best. It's not like I'm not a fan of Def Leppard, but I don't want to hear it blaring at a group lunch.\nAs we perused the menu before ordering, we noticed it was very different than the menu Upland has posted online for lunch. Far fewer salad choices, fewer dressing choices, and fewer vegan options (all of my daughters are vegans). Mother and I both chose the Bibb salad; apparently, it's a new salad offering with large, leafy greens, strawberries, candied pecans and blue cheese crumbles for approximately $11.00. When my salad arrived, it was a shallow salad bowl with lots of large salad leaves and a meager amount of the other ingredients. Fortunately, my mother's salad had a few more ingredients in hers and she seemed to enjoy it, so I was pleased with that. We did both enjoy the salad dressings we chose; there are only 3 offered so not a lot of options.\nWhile we were still eating our lunch, our server asks if it will all be on one check and then before we were done eating, casually dropped off the bill to me. I really do not appreciate it when my bill is dropped off before completing a meal and also before having the dishes cleared from our table. Am I being rushed to pay the bill, and if so, why? As a customer, I don't appreciate feeling rushed by servers. Yes, pet peeve of mine. \nI should also mention that I tried ordering the advertised Monday drink special, Helios Pale, but was told they were out of it. \nWill I return? Would likely only do so to pick up a carry out order of the Buffalo Chili as it is a favorite of my husband's. \nWill my 20-something daughters return? Perhaps for a beer, but not for food as Upland now has very limited vegan options.",

    "text": "First, this review is for the market, not the dining room, and my order was to go.  My advice is that if you love this place, do not place a to go order here.  I've been eating here pretty regularly and have never tried to order take out until my most recent visit.  One of the people in the group needed to get home quickly but we had been planning on Maynard's and figured we'd stick with it.  I never considered that the market didn't do carryout and I certainly wasn't trying to be difficult. It was my mistake and I'm not trying to be a jerk about asking for a service that isn't offered, I really didn't know.  I guess the market just seemed like a carryout friendly menu.    Anyway, my issue is the way the lady behind the counter handled the situation.  \nI could have handled a polite, we don't do carryout.   However, she was really rude and clearly irritated.  There was seriously no need for all of that.  She went on about how the menu isn't intended for carryout and they don't have proper take out containers.  Ok, I get that you don't do carryout.  Really, I've brought home leftovers plenty of times in what I would consider to be very proper containers so it's not necessary to make up reasons why you're annoyed that I asked for carryout. Just tell me that it's not something you offer and I'll come back next time I can dine in.  \n\nThe vibe in this place is usually so fun; it was sad to be in there both ordering and listening to other people order. She was pretty short with the guy who ordered after us too.  He was dining in but had some questions about the menu; possibly she was still irritated after my order.    Not a good experience.  We love it here so I'm guessing we'll be back.  But lesson learned, dine in only.  And if I see the same person behind the counter I'm heading across the street to Congress which is where we ended up that afternoon.",
