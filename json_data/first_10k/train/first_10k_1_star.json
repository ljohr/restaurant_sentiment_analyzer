    "text": "You get what you see--chicken fingers. They also serve wings and other overpriced items like mac and cheese (mediocre) and pastries (meh). \n\nThe sauces are unique and probably the best part about this place as you won't be able to find sauces like this elsewhere. Be watchful of how full the sauce is because some of the containers are not completely full and you get jipped. Sadly you can't sample the sauces without having to buy them. My favorite is bar b q sauce. It has a slight acidic vinegar kick, but isn't bittersweet. Maybe they cut back on the sugar? The chipotle lime mayo is great. It isn't too creamy and oily. The chipotle is subtle, almost dull and a little bit more would make it better and bold. I found myself having to double dunk the chicken in this sauce to really taste it. You always finish it wishing you had a little more. I've tried almost all of them and none of them are too memorable that I can recall anything great or bad about the rest of the sauces.\n\nThe breading is thin and crisp, which I appreciate. With one bite you taste the breading and chicken, and not just breading on heavily breaded chicken that other places might serve. The breading can be over salty and seasoned too much. Don't mistake this for rich and intense. It is salty. I end up drinking a lot of water with this meal partially due to this. What makes the breading suck is that it is not always fresh. Who knows how long the chicken has been sitting out.\n\nThe meat can be hit or miss; the chicken can be a little parched. This is disappointing when you have a whole pound of chicken to consume that will leave your mouth dry and leave you bloated after you drink a lot to quench your thirst and high sodium intake. More often then not, I always get the dried, salty chicken instead of the juicy, tender chicken that I once got at my very first visit. Perhaps I am unlucky and get the left over stale pieces that have been sitting out long. I can only recall once when my chicken was tender and juicy when they first opened.I try to avoid wasting money here because I have not had the same type of meal since my first. However, out of desperation to try something different than the usual univ city food, I have eaten here a few times to make this review justified.\n\nWhat my friends and I would like to do is split up and someone get french fries from Greek Lady and the others get chicken from Wishbone. We would satisfy our elementary palates by eating chicken fingers and french fries. If you are willing to walk a few more blocks, Allegros has really good curly fries but portions are a lot bigger when you eat at the place.\n\nI would have given this place 1.5 stars for the food, but they once cancelled a chicken wing eating contest on my friends and me just hours prior to the event with poor explanation so I knock it down to 0.5 stars, but yelp doesn't have 0.5 increments.",

They have one kid working there and he makes one pizza at a time. Don't have a menu up if only 2 of the 11 items are offered! The pizza was fine but it was really a strange experience.",

I've been before for chips and salsa and margaritas, and that was just ok, but I went recently for a full meal and I just cannot get past the fact that the tuna on my yellowtail tostada was cooked hopefully that morning or maybe even the day before, but it was not fresh. It had a congealed coat on the outside of it and it was cold, so I know it came from the fridge. The salad it sat on, iceberg, was so ordinary, it completely downgraded the dish. Haven't they discovered the beauty of baby mixed greens, they are pretty and make every salad seem a lot classier. The best part of the meal were the chips and salsa. Kind of sad really. In my opinion, fresh is always better and when it comes to fish, fresh should be the only option!!!",

There's often a long line of cars at the drive through window.  Even when there are no customers at the pharmacy counter inside, they seem to take a break between cars, making everyone wait for no reason whatsoever.\n\nRecently, I went to pick up a prescription I have been taking for years.  After I paid, but before she handed me my medicine, the woman told me I had to wait and talk to the pharmacist.  I explained that I had the flu and that I had been taking that medication at that dosage for years and I really didn't want to wait for the pharmacist.  I just wanted to get home before I threw up again.  She told me it would be illegal for her to give me the medicine without talking to the pharmacist.  That is a bold faced lie.  It may violate Walgreens's policy, but it is not illegal.  Ask an attorney or any non-Walgreens pharmacy.\n\nFinally, I was prescribed two medicines that cannot be taken together.  This Walgreens filled both prescriptions, repeatedly.  When I found out about the potentially deadly interaction between the two medicines, I pointed it out to the pharmacist very politely.  First, he had no idea those medicines were contraindicated.  Second, he acted like it was no big deal at all.  He never said sorry or we'll look into it or anything.  He just said something like, \"So you want me to take X medication off automatic refill?\"  I was shocked.  I left a message for Walgreens to complain about that issue, but I never got a return call.\n\nTime to find another pharmacy.",

I have yet to sample all of their fare, and perhaps it's a bad idea to fit them into the mold that Mugshots (which was gone before I arrived in Manayunk) occupied. But in the end, they call themselves a cafe, which translates into a coffee shop, moved into the location of a former coffee shop and they include baked goods and coffee on the menu, so I feel comfortable in holding them to some standard.\n\nThey were out of their banana bread. All of it. For all the flavors they described, they didn't have a single one left when I arrived. This is a significant portion of their menu, and they were out of all of it, which tells me that they have problems with keeping things in stock They had plenty of Baklava, but I'm allergic to two of the nuts they use in them, so even experimenting is a horrible idea.\n\nThere was a small child running around screaming, and I could hear arguing breaking out as I stepped through the door with my coffee. I'm not saying that without empathy, but that is never something you want your customers getting to be a part of. Even if the food had been perfect, it would have detracted from the experience\n\nAnd...the coffee...I have to  go back to that. I really do. If I has handed a mug of Starbucks and was told that someone had urinated in it, and my only other option was what I had here...I would seriously have to debate that decision. This is a horrible thing to say. It's cruel, and cruel honestly isn't that much more helpful than well meaning lies. It's even more horrible to look at in the cold light of day, and determine that it's still a correct assessment. But this is someone who, during his broke college days, would drink coffee through day old grounds. Someone who used an abandoned French press that was held together with duct tape, and I couldn't finish it. Seriously, it was that bad. I don't know how they did it, and that cup was an accomplishment in of itself.\n\nMaybe the owners are nice folk. Maybe, their Mediterranean food is really good, as other reviews seem to indicate. But they sure as shit ain't a cafe. If they want to be cheery, and have great falafel, they should do that. But dear God in heaven, who I have forsaken in so many ways, they put something on the menu so bad I am still  shocked. Combined with a lack of stock and that atmosphere, I can't possibly give this place a good rating.",

If I could give them no stars I would. Could not run out of there fast enough. Their half peeled shrimp was literal mush. They had absolutely no flavor whatsoever. The shrimp peel was brown, they were probably cooked about a month ago, put in a freezer and served them to me as they thawed. Their jambalaya was further than the truth. It was pasta in tomato sauce with a minuscule piece of chicken. And the fact that I had to pay as I left was bewildering. Not even their mediocre waiters could save, what I would call, the worst dining experience of my life.

First of all, there is a $3 charge for any order over $40 which isnt that bad but you would figure the there wouldn't be a charge for large orders since we're spending a lot. \n\nNever the less we took our dinner home excited for our new found BBQ place. We got a half slab, a chicken crisper and rib platter, a brisket platter, and a Tennessee triple platter. Starting with the slab, unbelievably dry and the sauce was ketchup with Worcestershire sauce. They have this coating that I've never seen and I'm assuming it's because they were smoked, however it made eating them almost impossible. The chicken was dry and had gristle which was surprising since it was pulled. The sauce again, ketchup and Worcestershire. The brisket...the worst I've ever had. \n\nBesides the horrible food, I've never been to a BBQ place that didn't serve Mac and cheese. One star and I will never give my business to this place again.",

    "text": "This restaurant was the worst experience that I've had in Indianapolis to date. A coworker and I decided to go to lunch today at a Mexican restaurant that she recommend it. It was my first mind to go somewhere else but I decided to try something new and Yelp something different for a change. Mistake! \n\nUpon entering we saw the sign for the lunch special wish we were both excited about, hey $5.99! We sat down and the waitress seemed friendly. She showed us the lunch menu. I decided to get the taco special and 1 chicken tamale to try (im still seachung for great tamales). Of course like a few other places that I have been too lately, my waitress comes from the kitchen to announce no tamles are ready for today.  Interesting because it's noon and you don't have my ready but you opened at 11am... #ICant\n\nI let it go (and took off a star), getting ready for my  taco lunch with onions and cilantro extra cheese. It came out in due time  only to find out I was not very happy with the food at all. Actually took me a little while to eat my second taco. The positive thing about the meal was the portions. The two tacos were large. It just did not taste like authentic Mexican tacos. It tastes like something that I could easily make at home. American best-try kind-of tacos. Another star gone. \n\nWe ready to go soon enough and we ask for separate check which the waiter said that she could do. However she did not bring out separate checks. In fact my coworker had to ask how much her meal was. The waitress had to go back and count up for her total and then come back and tell her how much the her portion was. Well knowing that I only spent about $7 in the restaurant I did not think I needed to do the same. Mistake. I was very surprised when found out my meal was almost $11 when my card was ran. Apparently it was extra for the cilantro onion even know the meal came with tomatoes and lettuce which I asked for instead. Never was told it was extra. I knew I had to pay for extra chees, but dang!  Management came out upon my request to give me a breakdown of the bill, especially since I couldn't get itemized bill. I was not happy, not buying the explaination, nor impressed. They give me a small, change of a refund and vowed to NEVER be back. \n\nNo tamales, no detailed bill, no prior knowledge of changes would be extra, food not great at all... Yeah, you have ok decor and yes you smiled but service is lacking, never again. #EpicEpicEpicFail",

One friend tipped 10% for it and had a female server chased us down outside and COMMANDED (exact words: \"COME HERE!\" with a frown on her face) my friend to come back inside and QUESTIONED her with rudeness why she didn't tip 15%. My friend who used to work at a country club didn't even bother to explain to her what is actual serving. By this time, I was truly regretful for tipping at all.

We were waiting for the line to die down at two other places but came across Creole House on the way to French quarter. The line was short and it was only a 20 minute wait. I am an oyster fiend. Living in NYC I got oysters every other night enjoying 2-3 dozens by myself. Thinking the oysters would be delicious , I ordered 2 dozens and so did my sister. We also shared a cup of gumbo. My sisters friend had a shrimp po boy with fries. After half a dozen oysters I started to feel nauseous. I didn't want to waste any oysters so I suffered though the first dozen. My sister has a strong stomach and finish 1.5 dozen. I couldn't eat anymore. The gumbo was terrible. It had no flavor, it was so tiny for 7 dollars(we had way better gumbo at another place the day after for way less). We had a taste of the po boy as well. It was just ok. My sisters friend didn't finish it either. The fries came fresh out the freezer I'm sure. Dry and scrawny little things. Should've just gone to French quarter and ate at one of the other places. Probably would've been better since the lines were longer. Would've been worth the wait. What a waste of money. And stomach space.",

    "text": "I've been here a handful of times, and bagels have always been delicious. I visited the shop on 5/19/18, and this will be my last visit. I went there because I was hungry and in need of food, but it seemed like I walked into the middle of classic P.T. Barnum show: clowns juggling while riding unicycles and elephants parading around on their hind legs. The first employee I interacted with, at the \"bulk\" bagel counter, didn't hesitate to let me know that I was attempting to order from the wrong location. Fair enough. They did have a sign on the counter, but it wasn't as conspicuous as an \"order here\" sign that dangles from the ceiling. Her tone made it clear to me that I had already committed one transgression. I then order from the attendant at the POS. I clarified my complicated order of a breakfast sandwich and two toasted everything bagels with a tomato and garlic cream cheese, three times. The first clarification was that I wanted everything bagels, not plain. The second  clarification was directed toward me because they actually have garlic and herb cream cheese, not garlic cream cheese. The third was my reiteration of the tomato and the quantity of the said bagels. At this point I had more confidence in a drunk ESL Uber driver getting me home safely than my order being prepared as per my request. After waiting for my extravagant order to be prepared to imperfection and gazing at the yellow ceiling grid with stalactites of black dust, my name was called and the first employee I interacted with hastily handed me my bagel bag. On the ride home I asked my partner in crime to ensure that there were 3 bagels in the bag because they probably \"F-ed\" the order up. He assured me that the quantity was correct. When I got home, I feverishly ripped open the wrapping on the two everything bagels, like a joyous child on Christmas Day, only to find     that the bagels had the tomatoes omitted and the cream cheese barely exceeded a skim coat. The breakfast sandwich was anemic at best with barely any protein on it. I am so glad that I expected disappointment. Honestly I'm not too upset because closer to my house there is a new bagel shop: Red House bagels, where the staff is courteous, the shop is cleaner, and the bagels a bit larger. Red House is my new bagel stop.  Sorry Newtown Bagel Co, you've been replaced. Although your actual bagels are slightly better tasting, it is not enough to reconcile the pain points associated with your operations. My words of advice, replace (don't clean) your ceiling tiles and clean the filth from the grid. Having almost 10 years of food and beverage experience, I would hate to see what your walk-in and floors behind the counter look like. Coach your employees on courteous service, or maybe treat them better and they might pass that on to your patrons. Oh and maybe write the orders down before entering them into the POS, because sometimes those machines aren't as navigable for some operators. I'd like to keep going on about this, but I am probably beating an already abused P.T. Barnum animal.",

I get back to my car and realize that he forgot the blueberries, kiwi, and 80% of the agave. called back to let them know the customer service was horrible and that my toppings were forgotten and was simply told \"uhhhhh okay\". i immediately hung up after i heard no apology whatsoever.",

We had a 3 hour layover and I neglected to look at the reviews prior to us getting a table.\n\nWe passed by several tables on our way to our seats and everyone's food looked straight nasty. But we stuck it out and went on and ordered anyway. We started with some cheese sticks. These were so gross. When they arrived on our table, they were soaked with some kind of weird brown juice. I assume it was the oil they were fried in that looked like it was last changed prior to the Exxon-Valdez oil spill back in '89. Horrible, burnt, greasy, and very \"off\" flavor. Our table mate next to us ordered the ravioli bites, they were also covered in the brown oil grease and they didn't even eat 1/2 of them.\n\nOur pasta dishes were equally as disappointing and gross. I opted for the lasagna, and it was NASTY. The pasta itself was overcooked, which I can live with if bolstered by a decent sauce, quality/fresh meat, and good cheese. This lasagna offered NONE of these things. The sauce was the worst offender. Packed with sugar, it was a VERY SWEET, very thin red/marinara sauce. There were no spices or typical Italian seasonings, no garlic, no onion flavor, none of the deep, rich flavors that typically adorn good Italian-style food. The cheese was cheap and rubbery, and there was NO MEAT in the lasagna to speak of. Literally, I had NONE in my dish. It was absent, and sorely needed.\n\nDO NOT EAT HERE. You WILL regret it.",

Since they don't take reservations for 2 people, and being the smart yelper that I am, I called first to check on the wait.  They said that by the time I came in, there would be no wait, especially because the concert at the Pageant was about to start.  So the bf and I headed down there 10 min later, and he dropped me off so I wouldn't have to walk in the cold (what a gentleman).  I walked in, and the snooty hostesses told me there was a 40 min wait.  Um there is NO WAY all of those people just showed up in 10 min.  Clearly someone fudged the truth to get me to come in.  And there wasn't a single seat or place to stand in the bar or the tiny waiting area.  I tried to call him to tell him not to park and walk down (he would probably have to walk pretty far) but he wasn't paying attention to his phone, so he never got the message.   He walked in, took one look, and I knew we were both on the same page.  I politely told the hostesses that they could cross off our name, and then waited by the door while he pulled the car around.  They proceeded to stare at me very obviously and whisper during this time, until I left, which  is bad business, whether you're a catty hostess that still thinks she is in high school (or maybe still is), or a hostess raving about how fabulous my outfit is.  Either way girls, it's rude.\n\nDon't get me wrong...the pizza here is good.  But it's no mystic pizza.  And it isn't the only pizza place around.  This story has a happy ending though.  We went to Dewey's, were promptly seated, experienced the best service there, as we always do, and left with full bellies, probably way before we would've even gotten our pizza at Pi. \n\nNever again.",

The guy at the counter asked us if we're ready to order even before we had the chance to look at the menu properly, not once but multiple times. \n\nWe ordered 2 lamb gyros, a side order of roasted potatoes and the tabouleh. The potatoes came out extremely fast and were lukewarm at best. Either they were premade, and \"microwaved to order\" or were just sitting on a hot plate. Not something I'd expect from any restaurant. \n\nThe tabouleh was SOUR - like salad dunked in a bottle of fish sauce sour. We decided to tell the guy upfront our issues with the tabouleh but all we got out of him was \"This is our recipe. This is the way we make it. It's fine if you don't like it, but this is how we make it\". I agree I have no idea what authentic tabouleh tastes like, or how to make it, but I have tasted GOOD tabouleh in the past, and this was far from it. I pity the people who've eaten tabouleh only at this establishment because they're really missing out. \n\nThe gyros were pedestrian at best, under-seasoned and most of all under-sauced. The veggies were on one side of the pita, the meat on the other - so you'd never get a mouthful of veggies+meat and only one side of the pocket had the sauce. Suspecting another \"This is how we sauce our gyros. This is our recipe\" moment, we decided to finish our food ASAP.\n\nFinally, the worst offense was that the guy starts closing up shop while we're still eating. Really? I've no idea how this place got 4 stars on yelp, but there are way better restaurants in Nashville for Mediterranean food.",

As someone in the event planning industry, I will see to it that I never recomend this location to any of my clients and will make sure all my partners and colleges know of the dissapointment that is Gaylord Opryland.\n\nI was hesitant to even book this location due to the horrible reviews, but this is where she really wanted to go. Lesson learned the hard way. Never in my life have I been more disgusted with customer service, this establishment doesnt even deserve one star. As a professional event planner, I am very organized and always check my reservations. I have been planning my best friends bachelorette party since April, and booked online in advance. I called several times prior to our trip to assure it was okay that a seperate credit card holder reserved the room, and we paid with a deperate one.\n\nI had guests arriving from all over, some drove 10+ hours and when they arrived, were not able to check in. They were refused to it being under a different name, even though I confirmed this was okay prior to arriving. They needed the confirmation number, but the one THEY SENT ME (email proof) was not working. I called the front desk while still en route to Nashville to let them know guests were waiting, and BOTH women were extremely rude and condescending. My guests had to wait an hour before getting a room.\n\nWe arrived at 4pm and had a tight schedule as we had activites starting at 5:30. We were supposed to go in, decorate for the celebration, get ready and leave. This was not the case. Upon checking in, I am told that they preauthorize the card AT CHECKIN, even though I confirmed several times over the phone that the card was just to reserve the room and we could pay at check out with our choice of payment. We had girls from all over the country coming that were bringing money towards the room, and it was to be deposited before checkout. We did not have time to go to the bank before our paid for, scheduled activities and the only offer they gave us was to preauthorize half of the amount one night until we get the rest tomorrow. At this point we are already late and not ready for our outing due to their poor communication, and it ruined our other experiences as well.\n\nThe fun doesnt stop there....we paid for a junior sweet with a sofa and a chair, two beds, and paid extra for a pull out bed. Upon FINALLY getting into our room, there is no extra bed, and not a sofa, but two chairs. This was crucial to our sleeping arrangments, and was all requeated and confirmed prior to arrival. We also requested it when they gave us a room key, and now its 12 oclock at night and we have one pull out sofa and they are still giving us a hard time about the sofa. If we could, wed pack and leave immediately but this is a once in a life time thing for my best friend, so were stuck here. Awful, awful, awful!\n\nWhat a great scheme, draw in customers with a beautiful resort and then dont give a shit about them once they're here. Class act.",

When my order arrived the coleslaw was missing, the middle piece of bread was in it, not big deal I can take that out. The big deal was it was toasted.

The lady told me it was made and sitting there. What the hell you leave a sandwich sitting there for an hour? Apparently they only have two drivers on today.

    "text": "The next morning we were up early, filled with expectations of the new adventures in New Orleans. We decided to walk to have breakfast in Surrey, which we found on Yelp. It was a highly recommended local breakfast place. Located far from the touristy French quarters, it's a small shack-dive beloved by locals and tourists as the best in local cuisine. Even before we got there, we saw a crowd of people waiting outside. The wait for a table was 30 minutes so we felt lucky and elated to sit at the bar. We got a watermelon and jicama salad and a crabmeat omelet. I was disappointment from the first bite. The omelet was soooo rich, like it was made with cream and butter and more butter-cream on top; it made me nauseous. The salad was so plain, it felt like a joke, a few pieces of watermelon on ripped up leaves of bibb lettuce  covered with black pepper. I needed to eat something and asked for a garden salad with a poached egg. It was a poor showing with some mixed greens, a pathetically thin slice of tomato, a few cubes of huge cucumbers used for juicing and a balsamic vinaigrette mixed by finger right in front of me. The place is a tiny shack, should be filled with lovingly prepared local cuisine. It is NOT. The food, as well as the service and the ambiance are a poor showing, more hype than substance. The supposedly organic fresh juices, at $7 a pop, are not squeezed to order but poured from containers from the fridge. Freshly squeezed should be freshly squeezed. They refused to give us water with ice. How can you not give people water when its so unbearable hot outside? We paid more for our breakfast than a top French restaurant in New York and I walked away hungry and disgusted.",

Tonight's occasion was Friday pizza night with the kids. What made it even more fantastic was the buy one get one free coupon I retrieved from Facebook. I ended up seeing a friend here who also had the coupon. Before I ordered our food I made sure to ask the cashier, Amanda, if it was buy one get one free for all pizzas or per order. She stated for all pizzas. I went ahead and ordered and added my friends order to ours, just to be nice. Once it was time to check out, the same cashier then said no, you can only have one per order. I purposely ordered four pizzas based one what she told me. I was of course puzzled and frustrated. She then turned to who she called the \"general manager\" and said I can only do one right and he said yes without even looking into what was going on. I tried to get his attention but he ignored me. He was a little busy I will add but when something is happening, tend to it. I told her ma'am I only did it this way because of what you told me but of course she acted oblivious. Totally upset me but I decided to just leave with the bill we were given. I was really upset not because of what happened but because of how it was handled. Rudely and unprofessional!",

First, I asked them what was the meal of the day. A waitress told me that they don't have any left. Ok that was understandable. Then I asked the same waitress if I can order meat pies (arayes). She said that this will take 40 minutes to make it ready. She pointed to a group of people sitting of about 25 persons and implied that they were busy making food for them. Afterwards, I asked her what about just a regular appetizer like hummus and baba gannoush. She again said that they need 40 minutes to prepare it! Also she pointed at the same group of people with her finger. \nAt that point I just left the restaurant. \nIt is horrendous that they needed 40 minutes to prepare hummus!! It is very obvious that they were overwhelmed and didn't want to waste their time on a small order. Very unprofessional and very unwelcoming! Very bad service!",

Went on a Sunday for lunch and our waitress took forever at every step in the process, and acted like she was doing us a favor at all times. Never smiled or treated us with basic human dignity. The final straw was when she finally brought our food, I was left to stare at it while it got cold for almost 10 minutes because she didn't bring any silverware. I had to ask three different waitstaff for silverware before I finally got it. And all of this for pretty mediocre, way overpriced food.

There was not a single topping even hinged on the the crust of the pizza.\n\nWe called back again laughing. I said, \"I am not even mad, I am impressed. Let me send you a text image of this pizza- it is crazy.\" He apologized profusely and promised to send another, but at this point it had been 2 hours and we had drank our sodas, and eaten our wings and had dinner plans so we refused another pizza. \n\nAt this point, the gentleman offered to bring us back our ten dolllars for the pizza and we accepted.

    "text": "I've been 3 times, so I think I can share a fair judgement.  This business is a lot of show, without the go.   Service has been the overall department that has been completely lacking along with some breakfast items are products of horrible cooking.  First time: asked for black coffee and a matcha latte, dad didn't get his coffee until our food already arrived (which also seemed to take forever) and I actually never received my matcha latte after asking and reminding waiters more than eight times, 8!!! It got to be comical, which is why we counted.  By the end of our breakfast they finally offered it to me in it as a to go drink and still had the audacity to charge me for it, so I said no.  Second visit, was dinner with friends, this was a much more pleasant experience, there was four of us, we shared a bottle of wine and I remember I liked my food. No complaints here. Third time, was another breakfast round... I'm not sure what it is about breakfast but I don't think they do a good job for breakfast. To start with, we were given menus for both breakfast and lunch, which was appreciated, but no drink menus and we were specifically interested in mimosas or Bloody Mary's etc. because we didn't know what to order, or what was our options were... my dad ordered a Bloody Mary, and I ordered a Mimosa. I only mention this because it was frustrating to see other people have different variations of mimosas and also bloody mary's, other breakfast cocktails which we didn't even know existed.  My dad ordered a ham and cheese omelette with his side of home fries. I ordered the power bowl muesli.  We got through two drinks before the food came, which actually was a long time. By the time our food came, the order was wrong - my dad had fruit, but no home fries as he requested.  We immediately let our server know, and she said she would go grab them.  Additionally, our plates were extremely bland.  Just an omelette, no garnish or sides at all (other than the fruit in the side bowl.  The plates just looked sad.  Also, I could tell by looking at the omelette it wasn't good, that's how bad it was, and my dad concurred.  The wait staff failed to bring his home fries in any kind of fast or quick manner, so we reminded our bartender, who then reminded to server, once my dad got a refill on his coffee we also then reminded that server as well.  We ate through the entire meal, never got the home fries, and in the end right as our check was being delivered we mentioned the homefries again, and that's when the bartender sent a server running for them, and as we were signing our check is when they came out and were offered as a \"to go\" option.  While a simple side, it was really disappointing to go the entire breakfast with an awkward feeling of  \"I guess they just don't care\" and instead of comping anything, the manager offered me a $15 off coupon the next time we came in.  It's just hard to ever want to come in again... and didn't feel like an adequate apology on a $45 breakfast.  And lastly my dads omelette tasted like McDonalds.  Only upside was that my muesli power bowl was delicious, just hard to believe it took as long as it did to come out or that anything cost as much as it did with as horrible of service and lack of \"care\" put behind anything that was done there.",

It almost tasted like the restaurant added fermented shrimp paste or something similar. That's also not an issue, in itself. However, it is now 8pm, and I have still not yet left my hotel room since getting back from Penang last night. I'm currently having the absolute worst food poisoning experience of my life.  According to my primary care physician, aka WebMD, it is likely that I have some form of aggressive salmonella food poisoning.\n\nThe other dishes looked good, and I'm sure the prawn mee is typically not vomit/diarrhea-inducing, but i hope this issue is addressed promptly.",

Packing was so bad that the dosa layer has stuck to the white sheet of wrap. It did not smell good either. I called them and explained the story. I was expecting an apology and someone to provide us with the replacement if not refund but nothing of the sort. They did not even apologize, forget about refund or replacement. i shall be disposing the dosa as is.\nUttapam was not very good either. It tasted sour and cilantro seemed old. I could not take it more than few loaves. Remaining will go in the dustbin as well. \nSuch a disgusting experience with them",

My wife asked him if they had any non-alcoholic cocktails because she is pregnant, and he talked to her like she was an idiot, and acted very put off.  When she did not like the daiquiri because it was too sweet, he replied \"well, it's a daiquiri\". \n\nThen, trying still to be nice, even though he was raising his nose at my wife, I said \"Do you have anything like a martini for pregnant women?\" And he said, \"I mean, we have juice...\"\n\nI'm alright with the fact that Mr. B's hasn't jumped on the wave of hip restaurants that  understand that when you are pregnant, you'd still like to have unique cocktail option (who the hell is still serving daiquiris?), but the dude was just an ass about it.  It's not often I spend 250 dollars on a meal and get insulted.    \n\n He was generally short and put off by us the entire night (every 15 minutes when he would happen to come over to our table... we had reservations at 5:30, he didn't take our order until 6:45).  \n\nAnyway, I hear there is good brunch at Mr. B's, but I don't think we will be going back.  There are too many great restaurants (We went to Coquette for dinner the next night, and it was amazing, and the service was excellent)  in New Orleans, and this place is top level price for mediocre food.",

Our appetizer had a dead fly in it and we were told by a manager we would get 10% off... thanks to our waiter [Alvin, who was the only decent part of our visit] it was eventually removed. We then received our meal and the jambalaya [which tasted straight out of a box] had hair present. The person receiving the jambalaya is bald so it had to have come from the kitchen. This wasn't surprising as most of the staff spent 80% of their time outside smoking and laughing[with their aprons on]. The catfish plate didn't come with catfish, there was some other cheaper fish present...the seafood fettuccine only had shrimp and Alfredo sauce out of the jar in it; I had to ask and wait for crawfish. We didn't ever receive part of our meal but it came on the check. When we complained and asked to speak to the manager, he was short and unaccomodating. He never once apologized for the uncleanliness and disorganization. This was the worst experience I've ever had in New Orleans and every aspect but our waiter.",

Tables are left messy and we actually had to wipe the food off of our table ourselves.\n\nI ordered the steak and eggs and when I asked our server if the eggs could be prepared over easy instead of scrambled, she said she didn't know because they pre scramble the eggs in the morning...\n\nWhen our food came out it was atrocious. I am appalled that the kitchen would even send it out in the state that it was. 1 burger had an eggshell on it and the other had cold congealed cheese and the bun was twice the size of he burger. The steak and eggs were the size of a side. And the eggs were scrambled...\n\nAdvice to management- hire bussers and greet people as they walk in... It's not always obvious when you should seat yourself. Also isn't fair for servers to have to have to apologize for management and kitchen staff not doing their jobs right.\n\nAfter all was said and done, management gave us $10 gift cards which didn't even cover the cost of our drinks and even our server said 'this is bullshit'.",

The menu says the omelette is made with 3 extra large eggs but it was clearly made with liquid egg product. The omelette was swimming in grill oil and absolutely tasteless!  The home fries had absolutely no seasoning and were equally as tasteless as the omelette. The only thing worse than the food was the conversation going on with the employees about someone's \"bloody bowel movement\"!  Do yourself a favor and keep on moving to the next breakfast place!",

I got an egg white omelet that was swimming in oil - greasy beyond being edible.  It took the waiter quite awhile to notice I wasn't eating and when he came over and asked I explained that it was inedible. At that point I didn't even want anything else so he left and left the food on the table.  15 min later he comes back and takes the plate because the chef wanted to see it.  It wasn't until after this that he offered to deduct it from the check.  Meanwhile my daughter spills a full class of apple juice.  I'm using bar napkins to mop it up and had to make several trips to the bar to get more.  Several staff members saw me cleaning the spill off the floor and not one offered to help or get a mop.  On top of that all my daughters chicken was dry and stringy.  She was starving and ate it bathed in ketchup but it was not good.  Thanks but no thanks",

Don't recommend ordering food inside: their employees are just standing and talking until you actually get something else, pay, walk around for a little, check if it's done yet and finally give them a look. That's when they go \"oh! There's food to make!\" Making latte in the morning takes them over 5 minutes, they're watching videos on their phones, chatting and slowly walking towards their stations. I hate the fact that it's the only place where I can get coffee on my way to work. I am the manager at the local pizza chain and my employees would never disrespect customers like that: if food has to be made they make it instead of talking! If the manager is reading this right now please take care of the situation, look at the cameras and you will see.

She proceeded to place me on hold before I could even respond. I held for about 3 minutes before she picked up. I placed my order and then explained that I had a credit. She stated she would need to look in \"the book\" for my credit. Another two minutes of waiting and surprise, she can't locate my credit. I ask to speak to a manager, and she says that the manager is out doing deliveries. Seriously...wth? She tells me I can call back later. Umm no, I'm hungry now.\n\nI ended up canceling my order.

The first employee to see me hardly even glanced at me, let alone attempt to greet me. He was seating 2 ladies just as I walked in so I assumed he would be right back to seat me. Bad assumption. Luckily, there was a second employee serving a table nearby who asked if I had been taken care of yet. When I told her I had not, she disappeared for a minute, only to return to reassure me that it would only be a couple of minutes longer for me to wait to be seated, presumably not by her since she was roaming around in plain sight the whole time. 5 or more minutes of standing alone in the entrance way later, I walk up to the outdoor seating area and find the first employee opening a bottle of wine at a table. After seeing him glance at me out of the corner of his eye, and still not even making eye contact or asking me what he could do for me, I stand and stare for a minute while he works, only to find that second reassuring employee finally peek through and open the door. She proceeds to ask me IF I would like to be seated. Now from where I'm standing it should have been abundantly obvious that I was waiting to be seated, but rather than admit an error on their part, she would have me believe she wasn't sure. Now I don't believe either of them meant any malice towards me, but first of all the assumption should be that someone standing with their arms crossed in the entrance should be waiting to be seated, unless they've said otherwise, and in any case shouldn't they be asked? If there were a host stationed at that entrance this could have been avoided, but as it went, no one knew that I wasn't being served and no one did enough to try and find that out. ~feeling let down.",

We looked at the time and it was 10:30 ON THE NOSE. Since breakfast was what we came for, we left. It doesn't seem like they should have had to be so steadfast about their cutoff time. If it was 10:35, I would understand it, or if we weren't already waiting in line before 10:30. I don't think we will be back because this experience left a sour taste in our mouths.",

She never came back. Another 30 minutes passed, so we decided to leave. Just as we were leaving our food showed up. They couldn't believe we were leaving.  Felt good to stick it to them for a 55 minute wait. Luckily the playhouse is a short distance away.",

I am writing this review even before I head to the restaurant for dinner tonight and believe me when I say this, that I would never end up eating here if the majority of the birthday girl's party did not insist on eating at Han Dynasty just because she likes the food.\u00a0\n\n\nIt takes 2 phone calls and talking to 3 people to get a reservation at this restaurant, that itself is a turn off. The first lady I speak to is flat out rude when I call asking to make a dinner reservation for tonight \"We're all booked for tonight and not giving out any reservations\" she says before hanging up on me. I call back and a second lady answers and I say I need a reservation for 15 people at 9:30 and she asks for how long? WTF??? \"For however long it takes 15 adults to get done with dinner that's how long\" She responds saying they close at 10PM and the lady has no clue what day it is and they are open later on Friday's and finally agrees to give me a reservation.\u00a0\n\n\nIt is absolutely appalling when people working in the hospitality industry are rude. If you can't be courteous to your guests consider a different profession. I understand you are in the university city area and have to, more often that you like, deal with students but that by no means is an excuse for ill-treating your guests.\u00a0\n\n\nIf you expect a 20% tip from anyone they expect to be given a good experience right from the time they call you to make a reservation.",

    "text": "My husband and I decided to finally try Picca's on a Thursday night. We arrived around 7pm. We were told there was a 15-20 minute wait. However there were tons of tables open, but okay. I have a background in the biz so I understand sometimes there may be things behind the scenes like short staffed or doubling seating servers, etc. We waited 15 minutes and were sat. The ambience in this place reminds me of the inside of a Pizza Hut sit down restaurant when they used to have the buffets. Not too impressed. The menu also reminds me of a chain-like Italian wannabe. Nothing special or innovative. Yawn. Our server was friendly and took our drink order. She dropped the drinks off and said she would be right with us. We drank our drinks and waited...\nAnd waited...\nAnd waited...\nNo sign of her! I looked at my watch. It was going on 8pm. \n35 minutes and she never came to take our order. We left some cash for the drinks and headed to another restaurant...one we felt confident would be a better experience. \nCan't tell you how the food was, but it is safe to say we will never go back.",

The lady bartender said it was happy hour and she would get me a menu. Ordered fried pickles and a beer from the menu. Went to pay my bill an hour later and the dude with the long beard behind the bar rung me up. My bill was for normal price (and overpriced). He said the order was put it at 3:59 it looked like. He was a total jerk about it with no forgiveness after I told him I was led to believe it was happy hour. Needless to say there was no tip!\n\nI went back, a few days later, shockingly. Ordered a cocktail. A simple old fashioned with brandy. I asked for soco and they didn't have it. So i asked for brandy. Cocktail was good. Get the bill later ... $12 cocktail. For real! It wasn't even an 8oz cocktail. More like a 4oz! And there was a $4 bogus charge on there which i was unaware about when ordering and that long bearded guy again behind the bar told me what it was for after the fact (something to do with adding a higher liquor quantity). I wouldn't have wanted that in the first place!! So again, no forgiveness and forced to pay that bill. Again, zero tip. \n\notherwise, you can get takeout beer here and the outdoor couches are ok. But customer service really blows!!! they're so slow and unforgiving and confusing ! I hope that long bearded guy is not a manager. Very pathetic",

    "text": "I want to start off with the fact that I've been here multiple times. The first time, everything was great, it was around lunch, the service was fantastic, the food was fantastic and I decided to make it my go to diner. The second time I brought my mother and she ordered a cheese quesadilla, when it came out it was just slices of cheese ONTOP of a folded tortilla, we spoke to the manager about it who told us we were wrong about wanting to order something different. So today I decided to give this place ONE last chance. Came in with my boyfriend and kids. We ordered two Reuben's. One pastrami, one corn beef and we split them as we always have. The kids ordered typical kids meals. When our food came out the Rye was completely under toasted and the fries were not well done. As a server myself I know that the cooks don't always listen to what the ticket said. One of the kids meals was completely over cooked, and the other was under cooked! (Roasted turkey under cooked, chicken fingers over cooked) The manager/host came up to the stand (which was directly behind us) and started coughing very loudly. I turned around to make sure he was ok and he's facing my table and coughing without covering his mouth! At that point I had enough! I politely asked our waitress for a box & the check. When I went up to pay the same manager/host was there to cash me out, didn't even ask how everything was just grabbed the money out of my hand! The entire time I was there the manager/host was yelling at the busser about cleaning tables; from what I saw the busser moved very quickly and there was only one busser from what I saw so yelling at him was uncalled for especially in front of guests! He also yelled across the restaurant several times for \"Ashley\" to come get a beer for another server, instead of just walking his lazy a** the 5 feet to the table it needed to go to! And last but not least, the manager gave me and the kids a dirty look and scoffed when one of the children asked if he could go give our server her tip, which is completely uncalled for and unprofessional! I told him yes but he needed to wait until she was done at the table, which he did. He then waited for her by our table and handed her the tip and smiled. She was very polite to all 4 of us and addressed any and all concerns we had! I'd suggest my server find a job elsewhere, she was absolutely fantastic and the ONLY reason I'm even giving 1 star! I will NEVER be back unless the management changes!!!!! I have been a server for over 10 years now so I know what is expected out of servers, bussers & management and this manager was by far one of the WORST I've ever seen in any restaurant! So to the lovely server with the bandana headband; GET OUT WHILE YOU STILL CAN! You're a great server and plenty of restaurants would be lucky to have you as a part of their company!",

Decided to do Tampa Pizza Company since we hadn't gotten it in a while. Unfortunately chose to use the EatStreet Yelp online ordering option.  Huge mistake. Order placed, got confirmation and credit card was charged. Went over to pick up food 20\nMinutes later as requested and they said they didn't get the order. They stated they don't accept Yelp/EatStreet orders online anymore. Never bothered to call us and say they actually canceled the Yelp order on us. They told us we should just re-order and pay again in the restaurant and wait another 20 minutes for it to be prepared and get a refund from EatStreet! Won't be going back with this poor customer service. Manager was even there and not helpful at all. No wonder why it was totally dead inside the place even while the Sunday market was going on right outside.",

The beans and rice were bland as well. They were out of steak, so we mistakenly tried pork skin. Imagine eating diced slugs stuffed in a soft tortilla that keeps falling apart. Now pretend that moment in time never happened and you didn't waste your money on something that traumatizing.\n\nYeah...not as easy as you'd think.\n\nI was really looking forward to the hole-in-the-wall authenticity, but I was sorely lead astray by previous reviews of this place.\n\nJust don't do it.",

The current kitchen staff executes the current menu rather badly. Chipotle shrimp tacos were bland and missing ingredients promised on the menu. At breakfast at least the waiter (one he showed up at breakfast) was honest in admitting that the salmon was no longer house-smoked as the menu says. Respect your customers enough not to lie to them on an easily corrected paper menu. Corned beef hash was more like chili, swimming in a sea of greasy broth in a bowl. Will give it one more strike if they get around to a new menu before improving.",

The bartender came back to check on us and she couldn't hear me and flipped her head to the side and her hair landed in the pitcher. She said she was going to make another one. She pretended to throw out the liquid in the pitcher and make another one . Instead she walked over to the other bar and just added ice to the pitcher her hair landed in .That was strike one of the afternoon. Then when we were finally seated I ordered the pancho nachos with chicken. They brought it out without the chicken. I tell the waiter. Instead of bring out a fresh nacho they bring out the chicken in a bowl. Service is poor and the quality of goods is not great either. I used to like coming here but know I most likely won't be back again as the standards in customer service and quality of food and drinks has significantly decreased.",

    "text": "There were two people in front of me. A young woman was working alone that night. I watched her take the other two people's orders and make their crepes from a pile of already made crepes on the counter and not prepare them fresh as they are supposed to. She took my order and I asked for a fresh crepe made to order. She ignored me and made my crepe from her pile of previously made Crepes and I could see that she still had at least three more premade crepes yet to use. My crepe was soggy and a little gross. I watched her from the moment I stood in line till I left and she did not make one crepe for the three of us.\n\nThe next day I was at the mall to deposit a cheque so I went to the crepe works to let them know what happened the night before and get another one to take home. When I started to tell the guy what happened he cut me off and said I was wrong. He told me it was impossible and I did not see that. So I tell him that I know what I saw and it happened for three crepes not just mine. Again he tells me no I'm wrong they are not allowed to do that and so it was impossible. I told him that he was calling me a liar which is a bad thing to do to a customer and that I was there and he was not so I would know what happened. I tried logic as well explaining that the word impossible implies that there is no possible way for her to have done however anyone could make a bunch of crepes and pile them on top of each other. It's not even hard and in fact obviously she did it to cut corners and save time for herself.\n\n For the next twenty mins he tells me that I have no idea what I am talking about, that its impossible to happen and that I'm wrong. He also has the audacity to say I'm just in a bad mood so I'm saying these things because of that. First of all this guy knows nothing about me and I was in a great mood before when I started to tell him about it I just wanted them to make sure it doesn't happen again. Now every time I come to get a crepe he asks me if I'm in a bad mood or not which makes me feel very uncomfortable. Plus when I told him that his customer service was horrible and NO ONE talks to a customer that way that wants to run a successful business he tells me the owner would treat me exactly the same way. He gave me a card supposedly with his bosses number on it but after I left a message explaining the whole thing I never heard back. That was over two weeks ago now.\n\nI do mostly enjoy the crepes although they are NEVER made the way the example looks. It bothers me that every time I go buy one he asks me if I'm in a bad mood and makes fun of me.",

After picking one out we were told we would have to provide the decorations, such as the tiara.  While I hadnt heard of this, I returned a few days later with a couple items, tiara and wand, to put with our cake. I watched the girl put out items with our order. When I returned to pick up the cake, nothing was on it...NOTHING!  At first, thry tried ACCUSING me that I hadn't brought anything in. Luckily, the girl that took our items was working and remembered I had brought items in and she had no idea what they had done with them. Once I started describing items, they admitted they had thought they were extra and put them on another cake (which doesn't make sense because I watched them staple the bag to our order).  I demanded to speak with the owner and she wouldn't come out because she was too busy(I could hear her telling her staff member that) After 15 minutes of demanding to talk to her, she came out with the MOST RUDE attitude and acted like,\"well, what do you want me to do about it. And said I could just run to the dollar store to get something else to replace it if I really NEEDED the cake that we ordered.\" After telling her that I was on my way to the party and didn't have time to replace the items her and her staff gave to someone else, she returned from the back with a brush and mirror. A BRUSH. After saying I wouldn't have a brush on a cake she just stood there and was like well do you want this cake or not because she had other stuff she had to do. They knew we were in a bind and I paid for the ugly cake. ..with just writing , just so I could get to the party on time. \nKim is by far the worse business owner I have ever dealt with. She is rude and acts like she doesn't need your business. I would never recommend this bakery to anyone and hope you choose another small business to give your money too.",

    "text": "Probably one of the WORST experiences I've had in a restaurant :( Let me just start off saying, the food is good! Nothing wrong with any of the food, the chefs are amazing and we all enjoyed our food. The problem was with the service....\n\nWe made a reservation for 9 at 7:15 and we ended up getting their around 6:45. We were told we needed to wait because there wasn't enough chefs, which is TOTALLY fine and understandable. Then the woman at the front seats a party of 2 and another party of 3. So I asked why they were able to sit down before our group (and by this time it was about 7-7:10) and she told me because they had a smaller group.... Okay well if we had a reservation wouldn't we be first to sit down? We didn't care if the chef wasn't ready we just wanted to sit down order drinks and have some appetizers. We were then seated and our server Ivan came over very promptly which was nice. After he got our first round of drinks this is where things went down hill. \n\nWe ordered some sushi, simple sushi. Salmon, and shrimp. We ordered 2 rolls, a crunch roll and a shrimp tempura roll. He brought out yellowtail, tuna and 2 veggie rolls. I kindly said that the food wasn't ours and that wasn't what we ordered. He told me that it was and that I was wrong. So I asked to see the sushi paper because maybe I marked the wrong thing. And then he said he threw the paper away but he took the sushi away with a HUGE attitude and said he would go try and find the paper. Well our group could see him in the back area and he pulled the paper out of his apron and came over and said oh yeah I guess it was my fault I brought you guys the wrong stuff.... Okay that's what we tried explaining! The stuff finally comes out and tasted perfect! So then some of us ordered the teppan and we got our miso soup and then once that was done we got our salad. None of us had forks and I'm pretty sure maybe 1 out the 9 of us knew how to use chopsticks so I asked for forks and he said yeah no problem. Well we waited out 10 minutes until we saw him again and couldn't find any other servers to ask for their help so we ended up just eating with our fingers. We finally see Ivan and asked for forks again and he said, \"do you honestly need them right now? Your food isn't being cooked!\" EXCUSE ME! I was so furious that he would even come back with such attitude. All of the girls needed forks and so we told him, yes we need them now. I almost got up to go find them myself! Anyways, chef comes, food turned out good and no Ivan to be found for about 30 minutes. So 2 girls in our group asked for boxes, myself included, and it took him about 15 minutes to get them so I ended up eating the last bit of food I was going to take home. So when he brought my box I said, \"I'm sorry, I don't need the box anymore I finished what I was going to take home, but thank you!\" (very politely) He then came back with \"ok well maybe if I take your plate away you'll stop changing your mind\" WHAT IN THE HELL!!!! At this point I was done trying to be nice. After2 and half hours I was so glad to be leaving! Ivan was so rude to ALL of the girls in our group! I hope if we go back, which we probably won't, that Ivan will not be there. I always try and give people the benefit of the doubt and maybe he was having a bad day, but if your day is that bad, don't come into work and be mean and rude to your customers. I work with the public and believe me, it's hard to always please everyone. But it's unacceptable to be rude to people!!",

Walked over to Fez.. no one attended us at first so we sat down at the couch area. The place was dead for 10pm Friday. \n\nThe attendant came and said let me seat you someplace else. I asked to keep the seat I was already at. He said we couldn't, so I told him to speak to whomever to get the approval. The guy came out and ask what's the problem. I said hey boss, your place is dead and we'd like to sit at the large couch area. He said they can't because that's for parties of 8. I said I understand, but there was no one in your store and if that big party ever came, we would move. Their answer: no we can't. \n\nI said no problem, packed my things and was ready to walk out. The guy asked are you really leaving? I said bro, no one is here. The place is dead. What do I have to do? Order a bottle? He said no again.. so.. went to a better spot! Saqqara Hookah bear broad across from City Diner! So much better staff! No young deutche bags trying to show how much more testosterone they have.\n\nSaqqara had great fast hookah service, really really great food and best part, was their service. They actually made the effort to cater to their guest. \n\nFez.. you are the old 2017. Do better 2018! Saqqara, keep up the great work! You'll squash the competition in no time!",

The bread in the cinnamon rolls was dry (either cooked too long or stale), there was hardly any cinnamon filling and the toppings were horrible. Mine was supposed to be a standard cream cheese topping but it didn't taste like there was any cream cheese in it.  Maybe they gave me the wrong topping because it tastes like coconut. My sister got maple flavored which she did not like.  The 6 year old ate her cotton candy frosting but we did not like it.  To say the least, we scraped off all the toppings and still didn't eat all of the rolls. Perhaps this was a fluke but I seriously doubt we will come back to find out. Sorry.

I'm ok with that because I understand the economy and the need to shave off extra meals that don't sell well. Apparently, this included any burger other than the \"burger\". They have toppings for it, however without being mentioned on the menu, you'd never know it. I used to love their hawaiian burger and mushroom burger. GREAT... I mean GREAT burgers. I still can't ding them on the food itself. Everything else on my last visit was a trainwreck. I ate with co-workers. One asked for sweetener for her tea. It didn't arrive. She asked again, and it didn't arrive. She asked a third time, and out of spite the server Andrew shoved 2 entire containers full of sweeteners. Like she needed 2 of them. One would suffice and they were slammed down in front of her as if to teach her a lesson. The management has changed, the servers are no longer any good and the service never even tried to make up for it.",

    "text": "Being a female I've never had to deal with tux shops until I/we started planning our wedding but you always hear the 'horror' stories of tuxes not fitting, pieces missing, pieces being dirty, stained, or damaged, somebody being charged for something, etc., so I was hoping we were one of the lucky ones that came out on the other side unscathed.  \n\nThe planning process wasn't a grueling experience at all.  With 10 additional men in the wedding spanning 3 different states, it was extremely convenient for everybody to handle their tux at whatever location was most convenient for them.  Having any one of the other 10 tuxes be compromised in any way (wrong fit, dirty, damaged, missing pieces, etc.) would be an inconvenience and obviously not ideal for a wedding that you pay huge bucks for everything to be perfect.  During the 2 months leading up to the wedding all 11 men went in and got fitted on time with only a few of them needing alterations or different sizes, my husband's being one of them (just one piece of the tux was wrong).  The rest of the guys picked theirs up with no problem, which left them to screw up the one tux that actually mattered most.  When my husband went in the day before the wedding to pick up his tux they couldn't give it to him because they didn't have it.  With only one piece of the tux needing to be replaced earlier in the week, they somehow managed to lose or send out the whole tux.  My husband mentioned that they weren't even very apologetic about it, just that that was that and they'd overnight the tux so that it was to them by the morning.  \n\nOur wedding was a couple hours away so my husband had to miss out on a couple things with some of our family and friends because he had to wait at home to pick up his tux the morning of our wedding and then drive all the way to the where our wedding in time for the photographer, etc.  \n\nFast forward a couple weeks and we get a card in the mail \"Congratulations on your wedding.  I personally would like to thank you for choosing Men's Wearhouse for your special day.  From all of us here, good luck and congratulations!\" - \"Jason\".  I instantly take notice to 2 very obvious things....  1-) Where's the apology? And 2-) The 12 year old chicken scratch that wrote the card was not Jason, the person who signed it.  Different print, different color ink.  \"I PERSONALLY would like to thank you....\" ....not so personal anymore is it?\n\nSomewhat of a slap in the face that they didn't somehow take note to their screw up and at least follow up with us via a phone call to make sure everything went well and to offer an apology.  Also a slap in the face that Jason Hartley, an \"Operations Manager\", couldn't even write a card himself, given the circumstances.  \n\nTo say I'm annoyed by this, would be an understatement.  I WILL say, however, that Jason is lucky my husband didn't tell me about all of this until after the tux was in hand and en route to the wedding (and on time) the morning of our wedding because otherwise, he wouldn't have gotten off so easily.",

However, the owners are gay hating bigots! This isn't a review on the shop or the product, but a review to let the LGBT community to stay away! I have shopped a few times and each time have been treated differently than the straight people shopping in the shop. The only reason I returned was to make sure my feeling was right. The male owner each time refuses to come from behind the counter to assist me. Its as if he fears he'll catch some disease by talking to a homosexual. Furthermore, I have been there with straight friends and each time have been ignored even though I am the one who need assistance in locating a certain spice. The one time his wife was around she intentionally (and randomly I might add) brought up a conversation about Chick-fil-a and MItt Romney. Again, this isn't a negative review on the shop and its contents but on the owners who cannot refrain from hiding their hatred towards a large part of the Tampa Bay community.  For those wanting to support an anti-hateful local business there are plenty on central and if you need gourmet spices visit The Fresh Market, Rollin' Oats or Earth Organics.",

Our server was mostly absent and left us waiting for our check for over ten minutes after we'd given up on trying to eat the food. My partner's Pepsi glass came with bright pink lipstick on it, and when we pointed it out to a server the guy laughed and asked if he had tasted it, LITERALLY IF MY PARTNER HAD FELT THE LIPSTICK ON HIS MOUTH. He also apologized, but we were still charged for the Pepsi my partner didn't drink. But not for the bonus lipstick, so, yay? I ordered a vegetarian pasta dish that left a gross greasy film in my mouth but was otherwise tasteless. My partner got the pork chop and garlic mashed potatoes, both of which tasted more like burnt and neither of which tasted like garlic. The mashed potatoes were watery and the meat was a poor quality chop with a weird texture. \n\nWe did love the salads and the olive bread.",

    "text": "This place was awful. I really like Mexican food, but this place is so not Mexican food. My hubby and I went for dinner on a Tues. It was busy for a Tues. so we were excited. We were seated quickly and our server gave us our drinks quickly, but it was a downturn after that. First the chips and salsa were tasteless, I have found better tasting salsa from jar salsa at the grocery store. Also we waited for ridiculous 45 minutes for our food to come out. All we ordered was tacos, a burrito, and one chicken enchilada. Simple freaking meals...I mean come on that should take 10 minutes. After the server gave us our food finally...he never came back to check if we needed anything else. We could not even flag anyone to refill our waters. The burrito and tacos were very bland but edible. The chicken enchilada was the worst enchilada I have ever had. I couldn't even eat it. The red sauce on it tasted like some old can enchilada sauce that has been sitting in their kitchen for awhile. After we were done eating we sat there for another 15 minutes before the server came to our table. I told him I didn't like the enchilada and he did take it off the check, but that doesn't make up for one of the worst service from a restaurant that I have experienced. We won't be back. Good luck Poblanos.",

She asked me what I wanted to order and was gossiping to a coworker about god-only-knows while I was speaking. When she brought the wrong item and I told her what I had actually ordered, she snapped back \"you didn't say that!\" Um, yes I did. You clearly weren't listening. She re-made the order while sighing loudly. When she brought the new item back, she walked away to  gossip AGAIN near the store's walk-in. When she came back, I asked how much my order would be. It was starting to melt and I was becoming annoyed. She said \"I can't just add it up in my head. Hold on.\" Okay, more waiting. When we finally paid, I said \"can I have spoons for my order?\" She gave me a smile and started counting out individual spoons, one at a time, like she was happy to make me wait. This ordeal took over 15 minutes while people were waiting in line behind me. I've been coming to this location since I was a child but with all of the other locations in the area, I'll be making a trip elsewhere as long as they employ rude people like this.",

    "text": "Hmmm let's just say avoid this cheesecake factory! Upon arrival they said it was going to 40 minutes for our table. That's perfectly fine it is a rainy night and I expected it to be a little wait. We walked around the mall and did a little shopping before they texted us to let me know our table was ready. When we came to check in the hostess informed us that our table was given away to a larger party but they were working on getting our table together now. Strike one! Don't text me to tell me my table's ready and then give my table away when I check in. I asked to speak to the manager and he also informed me that they made a decision to pull the table that were going to sit at to get the table ready for a party, but they would have a booth cleaned off soon.... That should have been my clue that it was going to be a sucky experience when the manager cosigns with a silly mistake.\n\nThey finally got our table pulled together for us and we had a very friendly server from what it seemed. We ordered and waited and waited and waited. (Ok we will say it was because it is a busy night) Our food finally comes out and my Chicken Farfalle was supposed to have extra Farfalle sauce on the side. No Farfalle sauce. My friend ordered the steak Diane and shrimp scampi. Her steak Diane was supposed to be MW however it came out medium closer to medium rare. We informed our server that the steak was not cooked properly and I was still waiting on my Farfalle sauce. The server informed me that she \"just had not picked up the sauce yet and she would get it\". Strike 2. She brought me back my Farfalle sauce and let's just say it wasn't Farfalle more like Alfredo sauce. When I told the server it was Alfredo she took it sniffed the bowl and said ohhh let me fix that. She came back literally with the same bowl she sniffed and said \"this is the correct sauce the manager said it's the correct sauce\". I told her it was incorrect and I have eaten this many times. She proceeded to try and explain how it was the correct sauce. Strike 3! I am done. I know what this sauce taste like and that was not right. \n\nI will not be back here and please whatever you do just go to the one in Green Hills! The Green Hills Cheesecake Factory service is always good and the food is always great. I've tried this one about 4 times and it always ends up the same. I'm angry at the service and the food is never good. I'm sitting here at the restaurant writing this review so that in itself should let you know the level of frustration I have tonight!!!",

Your not working the register at McDonald's....adjust to the customer.  The lazy draw was the no look pass of the document we requested.  I even said, \"really? Aren't you going to say anything? Close us out? Thank you have a great day?\"  The concierge just looked down. I was too much in a rush to address it. \nWorst service ever.  All the staff at the hotel seem \"over it\" not motivated and irritated with the guests.  Lazy waitresses or loud talking waiters at the fine dining restaurant.  Like really?  Do you need to shout about my foi gras? When I say I didn't like it you ask me to be specific....  Well here's specific....it sucked.  Tell that to the chef.  Everything he said was so loud!  It could have been the blaring band music....yeah that was appropriate.  He actually said they \"normally\" close us when a band is here.  I also felt it to be strange that when I called for reservations earlier that morning the staff member told me there was nothing available at 8:30 or 9 but 915 was available. I came at 8:45 to have a cocktail before hand. I walked right in and proceeded to look at the restaurant empty tables. I'm not sure if the staff just doesnt want to work?

All of the waitstaff were standing around the back of the restaurant looking at us awkwardly.  Eventually the bartender greeted us from behind the bar and pointed to the table where we will be seated.  I ordered \"The Cactus\" margarita, and it was salt lime juice and water.  Not a drop of tequila in it.  I'll give it to them that the salsa was good because of the added chipotle.  However, they have the audacity to charge $4 for an extra basket of stale chips.  Our food came out reasonably quick. My fianc\u00e9 ordered the chicken fajitas and I ordered the 5-Alarm burrito.  Mine was dry as a bone, bland, and not spicey at all.  I'm reasonably sure that they got a frozen burrito from wava and heated it under a panini press.  My fianc\u00e9e chicken was also dry and just over all bland.  Then came the waiting. We asked our waitress for the check and then she disappeared for 20 minutes.  I asked her again as she passed by our table, and still had to wait another 10 minutes.\n\nIt's a different story if they were the only show in town, but this is Main Street manayunk.

(Seriously people, this is a liability on your end if the phone breaks or there is privacy issues.) And failed to use it. So charged another person the appetizer in an attempt to hide the fact. Seriously, stay away from this one. Usually have a good time at other Texas Roadhouses. Never going back to this one.",

I literally saw the guy mixing a potato salad with his bare hands and then wipe his nose to return to mixing. \n\nYears later, at their new location, I decided to give them another chance. I will concede they said they have a new cook this morning, but my oh my, the food was so bland and undercooked and just overall gross. It's bad enough that the environment is reminiscent of a garage sale turned restaurant - where the items were kept in their original condition by failing to clean them. But on top of that, it's just overall dirty. \n\nNow, the icing on this dirty cake, is that the servers (if you can call them that) are not kind. They are unaware of the menu, they act like it's a burden to help. They need training. One guy was way more concerned with air drumming than attending to my drink order. \n\nIt's a bunch of young people, poorly trained, making gross food, in a dirty environment, where they're too cheap to provide real silverware or even a salt shaker. And WAY OVERPRICED. I got to pay $50 for my crap experience. \n\nSeriously, let this place be overtaken by the mold that's likely growing in the corner of the room. \n\nThank you. \n\nI will never return to this place again.",

Our waitress didn't even know this, until I questioned after she only brought us 6 items, and she had to ask someone else.  It seems unfair to charge the exact same price for a vegetarian platter as for one with meat dishes.  \n\nEvery other place I've visited served the combo platter on a big piece of injera spread out on a large plate but here they serve a few (very small) portions of items on a couple of strips of injera.  Their injera was a disgrace!  As some other reviewers have noted, it was slightly dried out and the edges were crusty!  To top it off, the veggie items were maybe lukewarm, at best, and pretty bland for Ethiopian cuisine.  \n\nAs we finished up our meal, I chose to eat a salvageable portion of the injera that had all the juices soaked into it.  Unfortunately hiding underneath it was a long black hair!\n\nNeedless to say, we won't be back!!!",

In my humble opinion the more negative or cautious reviews of this particular location are accurate and are consistent with my own experience of the place.\n\nFor my own experience, the presentation and cleanliness of the restaurant is fine.  You are greeted with a modern looking fast food restaurant with some nice branding about clean eating.  But once you speak with staff the experience unravels.  \n\nI found staff to be more involved in whatever they are up to rather than customer service.  This can involve on going conversations amongst each other, or something else that is not readily apparent.  In any event, some staff are completely distracted or disengaged.\n\nMy order took a while to come out, and it required corrections which added more time while customers continued to line up.  Within 30 minutes after enjoying the meal, I became violently ill, and the rest of my evening was basically spent nursing myself back to normal.  \n\nI made a complaint many moons ago about this to Mucho Burrito's website, but be forewarned I did not get any follow up whatsoever from them.  This is a demoralized business to the core.  \n\nIf you are craving Chipotle or some other Mexican branded place, do not come here.  You will be better off for it.\n\nIn fairness though, the Downtown location has been more consistent and I cannot speak for the other locations yet.",

Go elsewhere.\n\nThe steak was prepared in their \"Izzy\" style, but other than pepper, was only so-so.\n\nThe special sauce was pretty much just A-1 thinned down with orange liqueur.\n\nThe scallops ... Mostly over cooked without a good sear, but for one, which was almost raw and cool.  The greens were fresh and covered the plate so that it looked more like a salad plate rather than a seafood dish.  Still not certain what the starch was beneath the greens ... Risotto?\n\nThe waiter was good, but for leaving all of the dirty dishes from nearby tables on the busboy tray less than five feet from our table.\n\nSalt and pepper on our table might have helped.\n\nThe pear margarita was good.\n\nNo, wouldn't go back if it was free.",

The open window seating is great. \n\nThe food is ok, not great, but edible.\n\nThe service is where the place needs serious help. One example: I sat at a table (this is a seat yourself type of place), and the table wasn't yet cleaned. The bus boy (old man) was rude about the situation and yelled \"you need to get up and move so I can clean the water on the floor!\"  Umm, ok? Maybe you should have a better system for cleaning tables?

Now mine you we paid for these drinks I don't know about you but I've worked in the food industry and my store has ran out of ice before and we went to the grocery store and bought bags of ice brought them back and made sure our customers were happy until we could fix the situation apparently that was not the managers idea at this store. So instead of just saying sorry our drink situation sucks today u can have it for free they charge us. I went to 5 guys and got us cold drinks we started eating our burritos were disgusting they tasted like cat food and the chips were completely plain no lime or salt at all!

Paid by card & left a 4$ tip on a 22$ takeout order. \n\nAs they gave me the food i asked if i could have hot sauce as well and was told by the young man that thats 1$ extra... i had no cash only card but i was surprised because i was just there yesterday cus my bf is sick and picked up an order with the hot sauce without having to pay anything for it. The older man yesterday was super friendly to me and said if i ever need sauce to just ask so i was baffled that now i had to pay for it. Additionally this is the same sauce that is sitting on the table. I didn't ask for extra sauce! I let the young man know that if he wanted to charge me a $1 to go ahead but i had gotten it for free before to which he replied the rules have changed. And when i said that was yesterday he mumbled and walked away and begrudgingly filled a container for me and as he handed it said next time its a 1$... \n\nWhy do i have to pay extra to get the same sauce sitting on the table which i got for free the other day. Secondly i tipped u $4 on takeout. Ive worked in the business. People rarely tip for pickup so you still have the nerve to be a dick... I walked away with the food pissed off that this really just happened. and he had the nerve to yell nothing is free as i was walking away. All this commotion occurred with customers in the store.  Great customer service! \n\nOh and when i get home only one bag of toppings was provided for two orders, with only 1 lime wedge to be shared by two people... \n\nSucks as this is the only pho place around and i finally grew to like their pho.

    "text": "My boyfriend and I were looking for some good Mexican food for his birthday, and since I missed the boat on getting a reservation at El Vez I figured we would give this a try. The reviews seemed okay and everyone said that the drinks were really good. \n\nNot at all true....\n\nTo start with, we ordered the guacamole. I have had a lot of different kinds and make it myself at home, and this was incredibly bland with not a lot of flavor.  I ordered the Carnitas Tacos and my boyfriend got the Brisket Tacos (special of the day). They were all right, but the waiter told us right off the bat he would recommend a side since they were small portions.  We didn't end up eating any of our side since they were so big, we each only finished two tacos! \n\nThe most disappointing part of this whole experience was the drinks.  I got the Classic Mojito (which I have also had and made many times before) and he got the Mexican style Mojito, that apparently is with cilantro and tequilla instead of rum and mint.  The first batch were really delicious, so we ordered another round. Not at ALL the same drink.  They looked very different, but mainly they didn't taste at all similar.  Very very sweet and acidic, way too bitter.  We politely called the waiter over and asked if the bartender wouldn't mind remaking them since the first drinks we had were very different, and he obliged. A few seconds later the bartender came back and told us she remade the drinks but tasted them and they tasted exactly how they should be.  She was very condescending and rude (My boyfriend and I have both worked in customer service before...when customers are being polite in their complaints, there is no need to be rude back) and said she would make the drink for us 10 times if we wanted but it wouldn't be any different. She said that they first AMAZING drink we had must have been made wrong.  She kept asking us how they were different and we had trouble explaining to her exactly what to change, so we decided to let it go and asked for the check. Yes, we still got charged for the shitty drinks that we left on our table. \n\nFor a tequilla bar who is apparently known for their drinks, the inconsistency is frightening.  I was very disappointed in the entire experience, not what I was planning for the first birthday that my boyfriend and I spent together.",

    "text": "Despite a recent renovation, the Black Sheep is dingy and dirty and the sloppiest, most unattractive hostess (that is until I saw our waitress) sat us at our table upstairs. Although it was 10 pm on a Wednesday night, she was hesitant about sitting a party of two at a large table. Perhaps she was expecting a sudden stream of late night diners. The waitress was as sloppy and disheveled as the hostess. No makeup, no hairstyle and clothes that looked as though she found them on the street. I ordered something from the menu that did not have goat cheese listed as one of its ingredients, but she argued with me that the menu did have it listed. I showed her the menu and corrected her. She was rude and had a nasty attitude. I guess I would too if I looked like her. It was $30 for a burger, a salad and two Diet Cokes.The staff is arrogant, the place is filthy and the food is perfect for those who don't care about their health or appearance and like to stuff their faces with a bunch of high fat, high cholesterol, high calorie greasy food. No thanks.",

Also there have been some good events that occur here and tones of room.\n\nWell and thats pretty much it. The service is not exactly the best, they only come do something when asked to. However they at least do things here...read my other reviews. The building itself is just gross, just GROSS. We saw them put paper in the food. Seriously not only that, there is a stage and there are alot of shitty events, such as old asian people thinking they can sing...really who wants to listen to this crap! Biggest headache of my life. To add insult to injury is get ready for the salties food on earth. Its like the chef have no taste buds and have to salt everything to death. You can probably get serious hypertension in this place.\n\nOverall this is a great place.\nOverall score: 2.5/10\nFood Quality: 1/5\nPortion Size: 3.5/5\nService: 2/5\nKitchen Speed: 3/5\nDecor: 1/5\nLocation: 3/5",

A list of things that went wrong after that:\n1 When we arrived at noon, the order was not ready. We were told, however, that it was almost ready and just needed to be bagged. She paid and we waited near the entrance.\n2 15 minutes later, with others waiting for lunch at the office, no word on our order.\n3  She tried to go back to the register to check on the order, while I went to check to see if our order was in the carry out window. Nothing. Furthermore, the boss was stuck another 5-10 minutes behind a customer demanding a refund. \n4 When she finally got to the counter, we found out our order was ready, but no one had bothered to tell the counter that it was ready to go.\n5 The order was brought out, looking like food for 5 people was smashed into a bag made for 2 orders. \n6 The clerk offered 5 cinnamon rolls for our inconvenience. Fine. However, the rolls ended up being crammed into the bottom of a larger bag with our original order crammed on top. \n7 the clerk then darted to the back to get us utensils, which for some bizarre reason took another 5 minutes. He also put in utensils for 25 people into the already full bag.\n8 When we finally arrived back at the office, we were treated to one wrong order, room temperature soup and a panini that looked like it had been stepped on. \n\nYes, it was crowded at lunch there, but that's no excuse for horrendous service and terrible communication, especially for an order that had been called in an hour and a half early.\n\nThis Panera location really needs to step up its game.",

The two sides were beans and greens. Out of the three meats the sausage was the least worse. All were dry and the sides did not have favors I would expect. I did not like anything. You even had to pay for bread.  I tried covering them up with the bbq sauces however even those were strange tasting. The sweet was pure molasses. The house was the only one I could tolerate.  I think they need to hire a cook that has tastebuds. We tried the apple crumble pie for desert and we even threw that away as it had no sweetness at all and no texture.  The price was crazy. Never again. Go to one of the many BBQ places in St. Louis that actually has good food.",

It took well over an hour to get our food so we didn't eat until noon and our server never came by the table to check on us during that time. I can only write about my food but the hollandaise sauce was not hollandaise but some loose, broken sauce - It was more like melted butter than anything. Half the table hated their food and the other half liked it. I will NEVER come here again, instead I will head to Tampa or go to Kikis for breakfast.",

Worst service I've ever had in a restaurant. The quality of food I will say was exceptional, minus burnt gumbo (southern ppl can tell dude). When we asked to speak to the manager to tell him about the service, complete JOKE! Managment is where it starts. MR Bs owners should be completely embarrassed. We will be spending our money at the other restaurants that haven't sold out to commercial life. Almost ruined our New Orleans trip. Shameful.",

    "text": "How can I many ways can I say awful? Let's start with the loud country music on the sound system. The music was annoying  at the level it was set at. I should not have to raise my voice to have a conversation with the person across the table. The decor is a reused wood interior. It reminded me of a wooden cave. Dark and monochromatic. Not attractive. \nMy wife  ordered the brisket for lunch with mac and cheese and steamed veggies. I ordered the breakfast burger. My wife's entree came with more bbq sauce on the plate than meat. There were 4 skimpy pieces of brisket. It was hard to determine if the brisket was good because of the amount bbq sauce the.meat was swimming in. The bbq sauce tasted as if it was off the shelf KC's Masterpiece or Kraft.  It should have come on the side so the patron could decide how much or little was appropriate for their taste. The mac and cheese was bland and lacked the taste of cheese. Bad bad bad. \nThe burger I ordered was supposed to be done medium. Instead I got a lump of meat charcoal on a roll. The Sous or chef should be  ashamed of themselves for presenting this in the window for service. This is cooking 101.\n\nThe service was painfully slow. I could understand if the place was jumping, but my wife and I were the only food patrons.\n\nAvoid this place. The closing of this place cannot come soon enough.",

The food was weird.. The fries were hollow and the fish was just gross.. and burnt.  The server came to check on us and when asked how the food was we couldn't reply with anything but \"its a little odd.\"  She asked if he wanted a replacement however it was bad.. we were put off eating.. he said no.. and ate a spoonful of the side salad.. \n\nJapanese Dumpings for me - There were black bits on the bottom of my dumplings and the filling was sour and slimy.  I ate one and a half and couldn't take anymore. \n\nWhen the server came back she gave us a terrible attitude (Although I couldn't blame her.. the resturant was in definate need of an update and repair) She said \"I'll take it to the manager to look at\"   It was odd - we were starving... and we couldn't eat it.. \n\nWe recieved a bill for $9.00 for a glass of pop and a hot chocolate... \n\nI hope they can turn around - we use to love this place.. It was pretty dismal and needed some TLC \n\nWe happily at a combo 1 at the cineplex with our movie.. followed by some yogurt :D",

    "text": "By far the WORST Taco Bell ever.  First problem was we found hair in our food and it turns out to be one of the rude supervisors and refused to even help us out and denied us our money back so the general manager who was awesome helped us out and refunded us. Then all of a sudden tonight after months of not going back to this we decided to and we specifically asked for our nacho cheese that's comes on the burrito to just put it on the side like all the other t bells do we never got charged for it and my boyfriend is deathly allergic to it and for a soft taco instead of hard shell. Of course it was all wrong cheese everywhere charged for the nacho cheese no soft taco and the young lady who took our order tried to argue with us saying \"you didn't say that\" last time I checked the customer is always right. Working in the food industry i know good service when i see it and she didnt have any of it. Her voice, attitude, body language all wrong. The manager at the time accommodated us. He was polite and so nice. But the young employee however was horrible and shouldn't be even interacting with people. Pathetic attitude, laughing as she got our order wrong and horrible service all around and nothing done about it no apology...nothing. This taco bell just needs new employees and people who actually pay attention to what's going on instead of goofing off.",

We stand outside and wait, mind you it's winter and cold. We wait a couple minutes outside and then a second employee arrived and says to us \"it's not open yet\"? The  employee inside lets the other one in and proceeds to tell us to wait longer in which it is 11:05 at this time and none of the veggies and sandwich meat had been out so we decided to go somewhere else. They could have at least allowed us to wait inside. Clearly punctuality is not important to the employees of this store.",

    "text": "this place should really get a -1 star for inconsistent service. I've been here for a couple occasions but this time was the absolute worst. So bad I had to create a Yelp account to write a review. That's how piss I was leaving the restaurant. \n\nLong story short, we ordered the enormous nachos which they now down sized to a smaller portion than what it use to be. Not to mention guacamole use to be included but now it's an additional dollar. We also ordered 20 piece wings but when it came out, there was only 19 pieces. (Not that we intentionally counted but there was 5 of us And we agreed everyone was going to get 4 each, equaling 20) We brought it to our servers attention who disappeared for long periods of a time. It seemed like we always had to look around to try to find him and flag him down. It was very annoying, the server to the table next to us was more attentive to his table than ours was to ours. 15 mins gone by after we told him, still nothing. Finally he came back and by this time we just wanted our check. When we recieved our check we were still charged full price for the wings. Whatever, it's just 1 wing but the more we thought about it the more we got upset because it seemed as tho they didn't care about customer service much. We seemed like a joke to them complaining about a missing wing. My bf flagged down the manager and when we brought it to his attention, he basically blew us off and said \"I'll take off a dollar for you.\" Now that was insulting. Then out of nowhere our server came over with a plate with just 1 wing on it since he seen us looking for the manager. We don't give a daym about the wing. This is poor customer service. If we would have went anywhere else, they would have apologized for the mistake which we all would have understood, it happens. Then asked us if we needed anything and immediately replaced what was missing and on top of that added some more. Now that's customer service. For what they did, we will not becoming back ever again. It was a daym joke. \n\nSo you have been warned, do not go here and expect good service because they really don't give a daym about you. It was a rip off.",

The Alfred was broken and oily.   The Caesar salad I received with it was just an average caesar nothing to talk about.  The garlic knots were hard. The wings I ordered were over cooked and unseasoned and dry.  My husband ordered a calzone that was soggy and greasy.   I'm truly sad and disappointed with this experience especially since the prices seem higher than the downtown location.  I'll just hold on to my memories but I won't be back.",

I ordered a Mr. B's luncheon salad (dressing on the side) and a catfish fingers app. The salad came WITH dressing; the overly loquacious bartender was at the far end of the bar, regaling diners there with the tale of his losing another customer's credit card earlier in the day, and despite my efforts, I was unable to get his attention. So, I ate the dressed salad. Twenty minutes later, the bartender finally came by, and asked if I had received the catfish fingers. I had not.\n\nThe bartender ducked into the kitchen, came back, and assured me that a fresh order of catfish was being made for me. Waited (in vain) for another 30 minutes. When I had been waiting a total of 50 minutes and had still not received my food, I asked for a check (minus the catfish) and a manager. The manager heard my story and professed to be astounded, and he assured me he was going to investigate in the kitchen as to what went wrong. Then he jumped up and left.\n\nAnytime that I've experienced a restaurant malfunction of this magnitude, I've been offered some measure of hospitality. Neither the bartender nor the manager cared enough to offer me a drink, a dessert, or any other compensation for the time I wasted trying to have a simple lunch. What a supreme disappointment from what I thought was a high caliber operation.",

We weren't going to get our bottomless mimosas waiting around for her bc she was sitting & rolling silverware chatting it up with her co-worker. So I took our glasses directly to the  bartender for our refills instead. Food was mediocre at best. I ordered the hot chicken tacos which wasn't spicy at all. My friends ordered the lox, it was fishy and it was more like smoked salmon flakes; no actual slices of smoked salmon. Pricey for what it was. The steak my friend ordered was very salty.

    "text": "This review is solely for the hostess Meg who displayed awful customer service.  \n\nMy friends and I planned to come to Sabrina's for brunch.  I currently live in the Pittsburgh area.  So when I am home, I love coming to Collingswood for some delicious eats.  I had a positive experience the last time I was at Sabrina and was hoping to create more since I was asking my friends to be in my bridal party.\n\nThere are no reservations for brunch on Sabrina's on the weekend but they will accept at least a 30-45 min call aheads for a party.  My friend did a call ahead for ten am. My friends tend to struggle with being on time and there is a policy that everyone has to be there to be seated.  The policy makes sense and I was open to the hostess that we were at fault for not all being there.   My friends didn't all show up until 10:40.\n\nThere was no table available which was fine since we were late.  But I was not okay with the hostess rudeness towards us.  She told us that we never did the call ahead despite the verified text from the restaurant saying we called ahead on my friend's phone.  We let that comment go since we were taking ownership that we were not all there on time.  She told us that the wait would be about 30-45 minutes and they will text us when the table is open.  She told us to go walk around since there was a farmers market happening close by the restaurant.  She also reminded us that the whole party had to be here.  I don't mind the reminder but again her tone was rude towards us.  We let it go again because we were at fault for our struggle with timeliness. \n\nWe take a walk and about ten minutes later we get a text that the table is ready.  We get back quickly and wait in line since there was people checking in/getting seated in front of us.  When it is our turn, the hostess tells us we missed our five minute mark and the wait was going to be a 15-30 minute wait.  Again her tone was rude and this time we were not at fault.  Her time said we arrived there six minutes after the text.  Okay this means... we were on time but we waited patiently in line for people in front of us to check in/be seated.  Which means the hostess did not wait and sat people at our table. \n\nI initially was going to let it go but her rudeness was leaving not a good feeling.  My friend argues with her because it was not fair we were being blamed for something that was her fault this time.  Also she told us to go for a walk since the wait was going to be 30-45 minutes?!\n\nThe arguing was not worth it and I told my friends we were leaving.  We went to the tortilla press across the street.  It was a great decision, since the food was super delicious and the customer service was much more friendlier towards us.",

I got the Gai Jee and asked for it to be \"hot\". They gave me a sauce on the side. I poured it on top of my grilled chicken and white rice. I ate it and the sauce tasted awful. I thought maybe I was being picky so I let my boyfriend try. He thought it smelled and tasted awful. The only part of my meal that I could eat was the grilled chicken which was good, but not worth the price. Also the next day I was sick with food poisoning the entire day. I have never had food poisoning in my life and that was the only thing I had eaten differently in the past two days.\n\nOn the other hand. My boyfriend had the Pad Thai and he loved it. I tried it and it tasted pretty good. \n\nNo matter how good the Pad Thai was, I am not going to risk getting sick or getting a terrible meal again.",

For example, There is nothing like salad chat or a tandoori tikka chat in india. So if you are looking to eat real Indian chat, than I would not go there. I don't know how the place got all the positive reviews, maybe some free food for reviews, who knows. But this review is coming from an Indian who loves Indian food and has explored many Indian restaurant serving Chat across the country. I know it's a bit harsh, but the goal is to give  honest review of the food, without being rude. I hope it helps!!",

The problem was the kitchen, obviously, when the food came it was dry and overdone, the sides came later, the desert was not cooked(rice pudding).  The waitress did offer another choice and we will see how that is later as after being there over 1 hr we brought home.  The owners or managers only seem to care if a substitute was made and who was your server but not that the kitchen staff is being overworked with this crowd and cannot be attentive to their cooking when being pushed like this.  The first manager pushed me to second manager and they really don't seem to care as long as they can push the crowd to fill the tables.  A few waitresses heard my complaints and thanked me as they said they have been trying to tell them this too.  Well, that is my last visit here as I would rather go up the street to a smaller diner (Club Diner) and get a better meal and more attentive staff.",

Then they finally seated everyone, and we got the worst waiter one can find. He did not get our orders, did not refill glasses, when I asked to replace my fork because there was old food stuck to it, he did not bring me another one. After waiting for our hibachi chef for an hour, I finally went to talk to the manager about this. He was the rudest, most unprofessional person I've ever met! He yelled at me, and told me he did not care if the 12 of us walked out of there, and interrupted me every other word. Seriously, I could not be more appalled at his behavior, and did not know that \"customer service\" like this existed in America. Do not profit this guy by going to this place unless you like being treated like garbage for a very mediocre food and very high prices.",

    "text": "I applaud Gaylord Entertainment for trying to tie a restaurant in with the Opry, its a shame the food doesn't measure up with the Opry. I just had my one and only meal at the Backstage Grill.  I tried their Southern Buttermilk Fried Chicken and instead of corn and potatoes I had Coleslaw and Mac N Cheese. They claim their chicken is Iron Skillet fired, maybe it is, but it sure is cooked in advance, From the time my server took my order until it was delivered to my table wasn't more than 10 minutes, no way their cooking Laminate, their attempting to hold it and serve as the orders come in. The Coleslaw had a bitter note with a heavy hand on the celery seed. The Mac N Cheese was luke warm less than 100 degrees and wasn't a very complimentary blend of cheese's, it tasted strange. The chicken was luke warm, at best it was 100 degrees which spells their going to make someone sick holding food in the danger zone.  I mentioned the food issues to my server who took the plate away with an apology. He returned once again with a freshly plated meal and told me to be careful the plate was hot. \n\nOnce again the Mac N Cheese was not any warmer than the 1st plate and the chicken was just maybe a tad warmer, not piping hot as it should be. What little chicken I did eat had a off putting flavor and texture. The coating was both grainy on the palette and lacked any seasoning what so ever. I visit Nashville every year so I do  frequent good eating establishments, sad to say this is not one I will return to since I'm not interested in playing Culinary Russian Roulette.",

Waitress must have thought we were mad and sent a manager over    I explained it is no problem and I seen the policies before   he then corrected saying it is a state law in a firm tone.  Ok  I was educated   very cool    he then had to be a know it all and tell me that the Hooters ANYWHERE never had a policy about pitcher serving and he knew cause he worked with the company 10 years.   LISTEN  NOW YOU MADE AN ISSUE OF A NON ISSUE,   it was the way they were in Columbus ohio!!!!!   Experienced it many times  I Did not care for the vinegar based hot sauce, and  then mr \"know it all\" had to speak up again saying Florida will be switching soon from butter to vinegar so get used to it.  Have since found from 2 Florida IMPORTANT HOOTERS MANAGEMENT PEOPLE that 1  they will never change over and 2 Other one says they are really fighting it.  The outspokeness of this manager really ruined a visit and overshadowed our very nice and sweet waitress    she was one of twins   cannot remember name though.

Penca is a small restaurant and I knew we would not be able to walk in and get a table, hence the reservation.\nWe showed up and we were told it would be a while, a group was seated at our table.  We waited, and waited.  I had some disagreeable word with the hostess.  We waited some more.  We got two stories - one was none at all just \"sorry\", the other was the group came in claimed the table and told the staff they were friends of the owner and they'd cause trouble if removed from the table.  Doesn't matter to me because if the latter is true the owner needs new friends since the current ones will put them out of business, and if the former is just ineptness on the part of staff they'll be out of business.  \nAnd so we waited some more.  Given the timing leaving for anything but Subway was not an option. We got seated about 35 minutes late.\nThey comp'd us two drinks for eight people for the wait.\nI will give a shout out to our server who did a great job of trying to put this train wreck back on the tracks.

The rest, just the worst experience I have ever had at a brunch, the absolute worst! There were seven of us who waited and waited and waited for our food while others who came in after us ordered, ate and left. After an hour and 15 minutes, one of the people in our party had to leave and cancelled her order. The waitress told us they hadn't started on any of our orders at that point. Unbelievable!!!! I told the waitress I was extremely dissatisfied with the situation snd told her to share that with the manager. Truly THE WORST RESTAURANT EXPERIENCE.  I have no intention of ever going back there.",

    "text": "I gave this restaurant 5 stars 3 years ago. Since then I have had several dinners and parties there and recommend them to multiple friends. But after the second horrible experience there I have to speak out. (Last year I was racially profiled. The waitress would not let us in and asked me if I was able to pay the restaurant minimum. Her attitude changed immediately after my Chinese husband showed up.) I let the first incident slide but this one sent me through the roof. I just helped my friend's family plan a 40th birthday party for her and the night manager was one of the rudest people I've ever met. Let me preface that my husband and his family know him from many years of working in Chinatown and we've always helped support his business. To make a long story short: I booked a birthday party for 7:00. The family came early to set up, as he said it was allowed. At 6:30 he came in yelling that we have to leave at 9:00 because he has someone coming in and we can't stay there all night. I reminded him that we have a 7:00 reservation and that we spoke several times to confirm and he said \"So what I don't care, it doesn't matter be out by 9.\" He was yelling at me across the restaurant. He was so unprofessional and hurtful, especially since we've always supported this business. At 8:55 he came in and said we could stay longer, but I couldn't even look at him and everyone was ready to leave anyway. His verbal abuse practically ruined my night. I love the food and the karaoke room, but tonight was my last visit there. I STRONGLY recommend another restaurant. There are so many other restaurants that will give you the Chinatown experience and not treat you and your guests like crap. So, so, disappointed!",

I placed an order for a #1 meal which is their Big Mac. As I waited for 14 minutes to get my meal several other customers approached the counter  complaining about their order accuracy. I watched as several people had to repeat this process three or more times before getting their order right or they gave up in frustration. No staff member including the English speaking manager/supervisor ever apologized or acknowledged the customers exasperation it gave the assistance if caring at all. \n\nI figured with my long wait that I would at least get a hot fresh meal but apparently my food must have been praised long before my arrival. I received a cold Big Mac that was half unassembled in the box with my side of cold soft fries. Not sure why it took 20 minutes from the time I arrived at the counter until I received my order since the time was obviously not doesn't preparing my food and there were not many other customers in the store. \n\nLack of employee engagement, lack of empathy and poor or no management seemed to be the order of the day here. How on earth they can keep the doors open with every customer on site complaining and NO response or concern from staff is simply amazing.",

Not too big a deal, but then my daughter's chicken enchilada...had no chicken. We'd already begun eating, and our waiter hadn't come around to see if everything was OK. I asked her if she wanted to send it back but she said no, so, fine. The food itself was OK. We were hungry, we ate it. Her kid's meal was around $6.50, my crispy tacos $7.50, and my soda was $2. I noticed the prices on the menu, but wasn't adding up my bill ahead of time or anything because that's, you know, the restaurant's job. So I didn't blink when a check totaling $22.51 came, and I didn't pay any mind about tipping %20 (despite the faults, I've been a server before, so I can understand). In the end I paid $28. It was after we were long gone that I realized the total Should have been closer to $16, not $22.51. Did I get the wrong check and not notice? Did they add gratuity to a teeny little party of two without even telling me? Either way, that's a big no-no, right?  I wasn't being on my toes I guess, but I still feel a little ripped off. Ultimately they received more money than I personally thought the whole experience was worth, hence my poor star rating. Oh, and my butt was on fire all the next day, so there.",

I got a spicy tuna hand roll and as I look over to the chef who is making our sushi, I see him scooping the spicy tuna with his bare hands and packing it into the seaweed wrap. Then I see him walk over to the microwave oven, touch that with his bare hands, touch dirty menus with his bare hands, and then go back to my spicy tuna roll and continue to scoop it and pack it with his bare hands ! I couldn't eat it after it was served to me. Since I was starving ordered another roll and ate that, but BAD IDEA. I immediately became dizzy and nauseous. I drank lots of water and decided that maybe I could walk it off. We left and continued to walk around downtown santa barbara and no longer than 20 minutes after we left my stomach started to grumble and I felt faint. After running around frantically looking for a restroom I finally found one and puked up all the sushi that I ate. I would not reccomend eating here until it is inspected..",

One girl was up front sitting down while on her phone- there were four parties waiting and she just sat there on her phone while turning around looking for the other hostess who apparently had to do all the work because she wouldn't even say hello or acknowledge us.  When the other hostess returned, she sat us as well as the other 3 parties while the one continued to stare at her phone.  This continued for about 10 minutes.  This gave us a very bad vibe and we decided to across the street to Guadalajara.",

    "text": "I was a huge fan of the old O'Briens with the dive bar atmosphere and friendly service. The new one however is absolutely terrible. Very few of the original staff remained on the payroll and the replacements are rude and just about worthless. To top it off they currently employ bouncers ( for whatever reason is unclear to me considering it is a calm, older crowd overall) and one of which has a Napoleon complex and makes your stay uncomfortable with his patrolling around and instigating problems so he can flex his tiny muscles. The food is decent if you're lucky enough to get the right order and assuming it's still hot when it gets to you. Also, the live bands they have are never good and the place is not rated for sound so all you hear is loud yelling and feedback and your only escape is to the sauna they call the outside bar where you can sweat and battle Mosquitos and watch the owner pound back drinks and make sexual comments to female patrons. Lastly there is no entertainment value. The TV's are not synced to speakers so you can't hear the game and the engineering genius put the dartboard where the waitresses have to walk back and forth to the bar so you're constantly being asked to move. I've given this place multiple chances and really wish I could say something positive but it really is a lot of hype, pricey, and a terrible spot to spend your time and money.",

    "text": "A few years back my wife and I went here for lunch.  It's clearly a bar first and foremost so it was mostly empty when we were there.  I guess some people start drinking early, but not that many this particular day.  We had never been before but were close by and craved burgers and chicken tenders so we gave it a shot.  Again it's primarily a bar so don't expect it to be a place for a relaxing quiet meal for two.  Nothing wrong with that, especially if you're there to watch a game.  I ordered a burger and my wife got chicken tenders.  We got our ketchup and all that situated and started eating.  My wife took a bite of her chicken and immediately received a burn in her mouth. The tender had a pocket of hot grease in it so when she took a bite, the grease spurted out onto the roof of her mouth.  It was so bad it burned off the skin and started bleeding.  She got some ice from her pop to help ease the pain, but that didn't do much.  I got our server's attention and told her that my wife burned her mouth.  She replied, \"Well, they just came out of the fryer\" and walked off.  We ended up leaving with to-go boxes.  The next day my wife went to the doctor as the burn was still bleeding and painful.  We were angry so we notified the corporate office.  A week or so later we got an apology letter and a $20 gift card.  The person who sent the letter said he spoke to the manager at that location and instructed him to have a meeting with his staff about this incident.  As my wife mentioned in her note to the company, it's common practice for servers to tell patrons when their food has just come out of the oven or fryer and to be careful because it is very hot.  But the issue is really about the server's attitude.  We wouldn't have written corporate if the server had been concerned about my wife's burn.  We used our gift card to order something for carry out and brought it home.  We figured this would let it cool down.  But we've not been back since.  I believe the corporate manager was sincere in what he wrote and am glad he was having the store manager meet with his employees.  However, he should have offered to pay the bill for the doctor's visit.  Hopefully this hasn't happened to someone else.",

    "text": "Well, my bf and I were going to eat here for his birthday (a Sunday night) and off we went. The place is the size of a shoebox. Seriously. It is one of the smallest restaurants I have ever seen. Considering Jose Garces opened this post Iron Chef, what's his excuse? Anyway, we were informed it would be a half hour wait and had to give them our name (OK) and cell phone (odd). We were, of course, asked if we would like to sit at the bar. We went back, sidled passed a waiter or two and quickly realized there was absolutely no seating at the bar. I told the hostess we would be having a drink elsewhere, and to please keep our name on the list. So, we went and had a beer elsewhere, and about a half hour later, I asked my BF if his phone had rang at all. It had not. He called VW and was informed that they had called. We went back to VW and the hostess chirped that it was their policy to call twice. I said I had a hard time believing that as my bf's phone showed no missed calls, no messages, nothing. She said we could wait another half hour, if we liked. I almost told her to go eff herself. My bf used their bathroom and we went to Standard Tap instead. \n\nSo the 1 star is for their total lack of space and lame waiting list procedure. \n\nThe food I saw looked good though. \n\nMaybe I will go on a Monday at 4:00 or something.",

    "text": "Finally getting around to finishing this review...  This summarizes our visit on the night of Gasparilla.  \n\nThis was, without a doubt, the absolute the worst service ever. After waiting in line for 30 minutes to be seated, we sat for 30 MORE minutes w no waitress visit. Once we actually did get served and placed our order, the food never came.  When I walked up to the counter to check on the food.... the order was never put in. We were told to wait for 10 minutes   15 minutes later was told it was 5 more minutes. Once the food arrived, it was VERY good... but we had to take it home and eat it because it was past the children's bed times at that point.  Mind you, people who arrived after we were seated got their food, ate, and left before we even saw a slice of our order.  Nice.\n\nRecently I read a story that Cappy's has pretty much barred kids from the joint, citing misbehavior.  Well, given that on my one and only visit to the place the incredibly horrid service required my children to wait in excess of an hour and fifteen minutes to GET a pizza, this won't be an issue for me (although for once in their lives they were actually behaving despite the excessive wait).  \n\nWhile I am all for the supporting of local businesses (especially in the Seminole Heights area) and definitely see the appeal of a place like Cappy's (it is pretty cool inside, and had a nice vibe), my experience coupled with the anti-kids stuff I read pretty much sealed the deal for me.  I won't be going back, with or without kids.  Stephannos is right up the road, and they make a great pie without the drama.",

My fiance calls to check on the status only to be put on hold for TWENTY THREE MINUTES and then get disconnected.  We stop into Men's Wearhouse were the sales person takes a few minutes to get the tux.

    "text": "I normally LOVE Bailey's Range, but tonight was extremely disappointing. Our server seemed really nice at first to our table of four, but as the night went on, we saw her paying more attention to the table of four behind us. She was attentive to them, and checking in on them regularly. At one point we were out of water. Someone else had stopped to bring us more water. We had to flag down our server to get another drink for my friend, but she left so quickly after that, that we were not able to order for the rest of the table. While we waited, we noticed the table on the other side of us got all of their food...they were seated about 20 minutes after us. Our server could not be found for awhile, so my friend got the attention of another worker to see if she could check in on our order...this was over an hour after we were seated. We were seated at 7:33, but did not get our food until 8:45. She did not ask if we needed anything else. Our server never checked in and asked us how our food was. She never apologized that it was busy and that our food took so long. She did ask the four guys behind us many times, and I even heard her say they were getting 16 oz beers for the price of a 9 oz. Wow...how did they get that deal? One of my friends was getting tired, so we decided to ask for the check shortly after we ate our burgers. Our server flew right past our table to the table behind us to ask if they needed anything, then she started to walk away. My friend yelled her name 3 times to get her to come back so we could ask for the check. Still no apologies, no asking how our food or experience was. Personally, I was ready to walk out. But my friends were kind and still left a tip and did not make a ruckus. I completely understand that you folks were slammed with the Halloween convention in town, but it's no excuse for poor customer service, especially to those that live downtown and frequent your restaurant and recommend it to others. It's going to take me a long time to go back, if I ever do. I certainly will not be recommending it anytime soon. Sad and disappointed on many levels.",

    "text": "We have been to Zydeco's several times over the last four years and the experience has been on a slow decline.  At this point, we will not return.\nOn our visit before the most recent one, we discovered that they had gotten rid of the (really awesome) nightly specials and replaced those with a fried buffet.  There are some items that are not fried, but primarily that is the case.  Not a bad idea it seemed, but the price was 28.99 and 15.95 for children.  We gave it a shot and it wasn't too bad, but still we found the price rather steep.\nThis most recent visit, we discovered the price had gone up to 29.99.  Still willing to give it a chance, we got seated.  We ordered our drinks and three buffets, along with one dozen chargrilled oysters, as they are not on the buffet.\nAfter we received our drinks and started on the buffet, my husband had to remind the waitress that salads were included with the buffet, which she then brought.  Near the end of our first round of fried foods, half a dozen oysters arrived.  Not being terribly anxious to wait another 20 minutes for the rest of the oysters, we did not say anything about it.\nThe buffet:  It would seem that most of the food had been out there for quite some time.  The restaurant was not very crowded at all, so we understood why there might be some items that needed refreshing, but nearly all of the food on the buffet was rubbery and old.  When the server returned and asked us how everything was, we shared that detail with her and she said a half-hearted \"sorry\" and said that \"they can drop some more, if you want?\".  The reasons we declined this offer are numerous.  One - twice we had to get up and ask the hostess or another server to please locate our server, as we hadn't seen her  in a significant enough amount of time, so we didn't have a whole lot of faith in her expediency.  Two - almost everything on the buffet needed replacing, how long would we expect that to take after we'd already been there near an hour?  And three - I don't feel that the customer should be asked if they would like fresh food, it's awkward and inappropriate.\nWe decided to go ahead and get the check, but unsurprisingly, our server was absent again.  We again approached the hostess area and asked if she could please find our server.  She asked who that was and we were unable to answer, as she never told us her name.\nShortly, a different server came and delivered our bill.  We prepared our payment and waited.  And waited.  Finally, our original server returned to ask if the other girl had come and gotten our check yet!  We replied no, and she WALKED AWAY.\nWe had \"frequent buffet\" cards from a previous visit that we did not bother to get stamped, as we will not be returning.",

Well there was no lump crab meat and asparagus  was almost none existent.  3 scallops  and 3 shrimp.

If 0 stars was an option I would have selected that considering that the waitress attempted to murder my friend. The orders began as normal with myself and my friends informing the waitress that someone in our group is severely allergic to cucumber and that none of our dishes can contain cucumber. She said \"okay, the beef dish contains cucumber so do you want it taken out?\" We said \"yes\". The first order of dishes came out without cucumber and all was fine. The second order of dishes did not go well as cucumber was included on the dish. We asked the bus boy to take the dish back and he said he would have to get the waitress who came back and yelled at us that we did not inform her of a food allergy. She continuously yelled stating \"you ordered it like this\", \"I only brought what you ordered\", \"you get what you asked for\" and proceeded to get closer to my friend and yell in her face while my friend calmly tried to explain that we said we cannot have any cucumber on the table. She took the plate and then had the bus boy bring it back without cucumber. Given the severity of the allergy, we moved the plate to the opposite of our friend. We were unsure if the plate was taken back and just replated without cucumbers and felt that anaphylaxis wasn't worth it. After yelling, she refused to come back to our table the rest of the night and sent bus boys to take our requests. If you or anyone here has any food allergy, it's not worth the risk because even normal forewarning is useless here and if you try to clear up any misunderstanding the waitress may yell at you like they are from WWE. The busboys deserve all the credit for making the night salvageable as they were attentive, courteous, and on top of it.",

    "text": "I stopped here because it looked nice and my friends and I were starving. Upon entering we were yelled at to shut the door (we were literally just crossing the threshold when the waiter snapped at us) and then he took menus and literally threw them on a table and walked away. We waited for over 10 minutes before anyone ever greeted the table and the only reason anyone ever came was because I had to flag down another server when she walked passed us (and another table who had been seated just before us who also had no server) to greet a table who just walked in. Our server was the same guy who yelled at us earlier and when I suggested to my sister that she order her food with her drink he said \"yeah lets just get this all over with at once\". The burger was disgusting, it looked like a McDonalds hamburger but greasier. I just got coffee so I can't say I tasted it but if it had been served to me I would have returned it. I had to flag the server down for the check and when I put my card out to be taken (everyone else was paying in cash) he walked by literally six times without taking the card. I ended up just paying cash. I have served my entire college career so I understand what the job is like but to be blatantly hostile is something I will never understand. Yes, we are tourists just like probably 90% of the restaurant (it was Sugar bowl weekend so the team colors gave it away) but that is no excuse to treat people so poorly. This was the first time I have not tipped someone and this is the first time I've written a negative review but I was really that upset about it. I made sure to tell all my friends to steer clear of this place when they visit.",

I ordered the lettuce wraps, every piece of lettuce was brown and slimy. We ordered soy sauce, hot mustard, chop sticks, etc. and did not receive.  My colleague called this location to complain, the manager he spoke with said he would remove the wraps from bill, but we had paid cash. Also stated he would send a gift card, it's been two weeks and still did not receive.  After spending $45.00 for a basic lunch, plus a tip to the person who brought it to the car, one would expect a bit of a response from the management.  I chose PF Chang's as a nice treat for lunch, as a job well done for one of my employees, how embarrassing that it was so terrible. I would have been better off ordering from McDonald's.",

Then I asked to use the restroom. \n\nI poked my head in the kitchen and asked the brothers where it was. The chef brother told me I was interrupting him and his brother and that the only place I was allowed to talk to my server was on the floor. I thought he was kidding and the server brother sent me to the restroom. \n\nI came back from the restroom and the chef brother stopped me as I passed the kitchen to tell me that I was never allowed to come near his kitchen and that I needed to get the hell out of his restaurant. I told him I would be happy to leave since he was obviously insane. \n\nThe server brother came back to ask to the kitchen to investigate why the chef brother was yelling at a customer. As we left I heard the brothers going at it again. \n\nThe service was terrible. Because the brothers were having a bad day it was literally impossible for our table to complete placing an order without our server walking away while someone was speaking. We waited at least 15 minutes to place an order while watching the brothers argue in the door to the kitchen. \n\nThe food we got, bread and either whipped butter in a dish of oil, was revolting. Primarily because none of us could figure out if it was whipped butter or some sort of soft cheese. \n\nIt's obvious this is not the first time there two have had these kinds of arguments in their restaurant with customers present based on how easily they engaged in their unprofessional behavior. It's also obvious by how the chef brother treated me that I am not the first customer he has blown up at for no reason. \n\nThe relationship between these brothers and their inability to maintain professionalism is going to bring this restaurant down. You simply can't treat customers, or co-workers, the way they treat them.",

I thought to myself, \"wow it must be awesome!\" So I decided to grin and bear the wait to finally experience what I thought was gonna be awesome. The breakfast was extremely expensive for mediocre taste. I had a simple breakfast of 2 eggs, home fries, turkey sausage and 3 pancakes and I asked for a side of toast (the honey's platter) What I received was the smallest pancakes I've ever seen, 2 eggs, one small sausage, a bite of potatoes and my side of toast was one slice not even toasted. This platter cost me $13 THIRTEEN DOLLARS!?!? The taste was sub par I couldn't finish the sausage bc it was gross, the potatoes were greasy, the eggs were cooked well and so were the pancakes but 13 dollars for a standard breakfast is insane. My one slice of untoasted bread was another $2.50!!!! Don't get me wrong I'm all for spending a decent amount of money on a good meal but this was hardly that. My dining partner got the Christo which is essentially a ham and cheese sandwich and a small amount of greens on the side, which she enjoyed but was $14. All in all the check came to $42 after drinks and tip. I would never return to this place, I left feeling dissatisfied and let down and created a yelp account just to write this review. The only thing good about this place was the company and the service was on point (but I guess it should be when you're charging that much for breakfast items)  If you want a good meal that's worth your $ with top notch food this isn't the place and you should try Silk City!",

How in the world can they sack up and order that has items that are standard with every order I have no idea. To make matters worse, I called since the distance we live it's not practical just to jump in the car and go back for the items they screwed up on. No one would answer the phone for several minutes. After multiple attempts, a girl finally answered. When I asked to speak with a Manager, she just hesitated and said ok. Then she literally put the phone down, and I could hear their conversation, none of which involved needing a Mgr on the phone. Hung up after a few mins, only to call and call to listen to a busy signal. The food itself was ok, chicken seemed like it had been cooked for awhile and the amount of wasted extra skin made small pieces look huge. Clearly this location has lost it's way but I even filled out a customer survey on the receipt asking to speak with a Mgr or GM, even the owner. Never even heard from a line cook so Churchs as a whole must have no regard for customer service. Why even have a survey on the receipt? If they had just answered the dang phone that day and addressed the situation I would have possibly returned to get my items they shorted me and it would have been over. Why would I, or anyone, want to give them another chance after such abysmal service.",

A few pairs were the wrong size (3 of 8), but it was easy enough to resolve. After getting settled at our lane, we ordered a few drinks. After receiving our drinks, the waitress (named Leah E., according to our receipt) never came back to us. We waited for roughly 30 minutes for her to come to us but never did. For approximately 20 minutes after that, we waited for her to come into our vicinity and tried to flag her down, but it took a few tries before she saw us. Please know that while the lanes on either side of us also had parties, half of the lanes were unused, the bar was not full, and the tables were empty. It was a Sunday evening at about 8:30 or 9. Once the food was delivered, we never saw our server again. Please don't misconstrue my statement as hyperbole...I didn't just not see the server at our table, I didn't see her at any table. She didn't check on the two neighboring parties, but we did see her behind the bar a few times. She was not the only server on staff, as others were seen serving other lanes and, as established previously, the place was not busting at the seams. The food order was wrong, the drink order was improperly charged, we had to go to the bar for silverware. We did go to the bar for drinks due to her absence, and the bar service was pleasant but slow. When the check came and we attempted to fix a mistake on the check (we ordered a single slider burger but were charged for a plate. When we brought it to her attention, she said not to worry about it. We asked if we would be charged for just a slider (aka the thing we ordered) or if we'd be charged the plate meal (what we got). She replied that we would be charged the single slider. When the check came, we were charged the meal. She changed it without complaint. However, someone in our group ordered two wells vodkas and she charged Ketel One to the ticket both times due to a misunderstanding. She was less happy and less willing to understand or resolve this issue, resorting to having another server bring the final ticket, run our card, and bid us farewell. She did not make eye contact after his point (even after a member from our group returned to the table to retrieve a jacket). She did not apologize for mix ups, misunderstandings, or wait times, and she did not thank us for our business or wish us good night.To top it all off: while I think waitstaff have the right to whatever emotions and experiences they will on a given shift, our server was not the most cheerful person. It could be that she had a bad night (God knows we all have em). But after seeing all of the other bad reviews, I felt it might benefit the community to add to the menagerie of disenchanted customers' reviews. As an organizational psychologist, a patron, and Louisiana resident, I wish the alley would work on resolving the issues in their customer service.",

He literally threw a cork screw at me for me to open my own wine bottle. He then proceeds to write my order and I saw him write it down with his pen on his pad. Food comes out and I don't get my meal, everyone is eating and he said he didn't write it down wanted to know what I got and he'll put in the order now.  He then places soup in front of me and says \"here this will keep you preoccupied while you wait\".... Oh thanks! Everyone in my party is finished eating so I tell him to please just cancel it if the chef didn't start making it and he goes.. \"ok\" and walks away...not are you sure? it'll be a minute... So he brings out the food anyway and I said I'm sorry I don't want it anymore thanks though, because I'm beyond annoyed at this point and he goes well \"the chef didn't even want to make it...

There was a long wait for the food, the server was aloof and uncaring, but the worst part of all was due to some \"technical problem,\" it took nearly an hour to get the check. Management was completely inept and uncaring. The right thing to do in that situation would be to comp the meal, but no. Just a lame apology--no discount, no free dessert or drink, no compensation at all for the huge inconvenience caused by them and them alone. Definitely won't be returning to this location.

What I DO know is that my husband and I were going to try it out for lunch today....we're big fans of Diners Drive-ins and Dives so we thought we'd check it out. As we pull into the parking lot - at 2:30 in the afternoon, mind you - we see two girls (not grown women, girls) standing behind one of their cars out in the open in the main lane of the parking lot just feet from the entrance MAKING OUT. This was far more than minor PDA, it was almost vulgar in a soft-porn type of style. We parked and as we got ready to go in one of the girls was walking in the door. Although I can't be 100% certain, I do assume she works there....she was carrying a server apron and other items in with her. When we tried to call and inform the management, we were lead in a circle of automation that never allowed us to talk to an actual person. I'm all for 'love is love' but I don't want it shoved in my face when I'm getting ready to eat. We will NOT be visiting this establishment for this very reason.",

    "text": "If I could give this establishment zero stars, I would. The manager/owner (I'm not sure what position he holds) is extremely rude to every customer that walks in the door. He's an older man with glasses and a constant look on his face as if he hates his life and job. If you see him, be prepared for a world of rude and abrasive responses. On one occasion, we went in and were told it would be a 45 minute wait even though there were multiple tables (both hibachi and regular) open. While I have worked in food service as a manager much of my adult life, I understand there are circumstances that are often out of the managers' control in terms of who is working and how many tables a server may have. However, there is an appropriate and POLITE way to address the situation. Today I called the restaurant repeatedly to see what time they served lunch till. The phone rang and went to an answering machine each time. When we arrived at the restaurant, the man, who seemed more preoccupied with his laptop and sitting on his butt, was extremely rude to the guests in front of me as well as to myself and my family. He snapped as us and said they are closed at 2:30 - it was 2:15 when we walked in. If the restaurant closes prior to the posted time, they should probably lock the door or put a sign outside to avoid any customer interacting with this so-called manager. I will never recommend this restaurant to anyone and will never be back to be treated so poorly for over-priced, sub standard food. It is pity because we live so close and would probably be frequent guests at such an establishment. Between our group and the group in front of us, the restaurant lost out on hundreds of dollars of business. This has been a consistent experience and it is absolutely ridiculous. Do not come here, go anywhere else that deserves your hard earned money. The experience and cost are not worth the time and frustration. This place should be shut down or hire new managers to run it. Ridiculous.",

I again asked about buying the Moto G5, and he said they did not sell it.  I walked over to the one tethered to the counter and said I was confused.  He said \"We don't sell those anymore.\"   I asked what phones they DID have that were no more than 5.5 inches long.  Other than an iPhone, none. He also said they sold no unlocked phones.   I asked if I could buy an unlocked phone elsewhere and bring it in to buy a prepaid service plan.  He said he would go and ask.  He then went behind the counter, entered a code into a door lock, slipped into a back room for several minutes, and then came out and said no dice.

Vacationing near weekie wachee and wanted some good thai food and saw all the good reviews so though lets try it. 1st off came here mon cuz yelp said they were opened and they were closed so came the next day.  The thai lady with glasses sat our party of 8, they was only 3 tables in the whole place and her lack of enthusiasm to service us just set the tone for the whole meal.  Seemed like she was rushing us  the whole time,  quick to seat us,  basically  threw our food at us,  quick to take our plates and quick to give us the check.  Now i don't know if these other yelpers being from a small town knew what real thai food should taste like but this ain't it.  I got the panang curry and my bowl of curry had tons of over cooked veg small amount meat and hardly any curry. My wife got pad  thai. Now being from atlanta we had our fair share of pad thai and this was horrible the pad thai was wet, watery, too sweet  and the sauce tasted like grocery store bought generic pad thai sauce. The appetizers were nothing special and not plated well. If your desperate  for thai then do it, but if you are expecting authentic great Thai food aviod.\nFood ... 3\nDecor .... 7\nService .... 2\nAtmosphere  ... 5\nWould i eat here again .... nope, even if i was desperate",

According to the FTC: \"Money on a gift card cannot expire for at least five years from the date the card was purchased, or from the last date any additional money was loaded onto the card. If the expiration date listed on the card is earlier than these dates, the money can be transferred to a replacement card at no cost.\"  When we requested they honor the gift card the manager refused to do so. This is an illegal practice and I DO NOT recommend anyone ever purchase a gift card.

    "text": "The only thing good about this place is the food. It's amazing. That is, when you can actually get it, which is unfortunate because this place could have incredible potential if the staff was competent. \n\nFlashback to a month or two ago. The weather was about to get bad, so the g/f and I decided to order some food to go before the storm came in. We placed an online order through their website. We arrived at the time the site said the food would be ready, only to be met with puzzled stares from the staff. They had received no online order. We showed the cashier the order confirmation and they informed us the online ordering system was having some issues. Ok, fine.\n\nFast forward to today, about an hour ago, the g/f and her friend wanted to meet up for brunch, so we decided on coming here. Their menu clearly states that brunch is \"All Day Sunday, 9am - 4 pm\". We get in line and begin to order brunch, when the cashier girl tells us they're, \"Not doing brunch today.\" I told her that was the whole reason we came. She replied that they were having some, \"Complications\" - whatever that means. Strike one.\n\nI order a sugar-free vanilla latte. My g/f, who was standing next to me, told me they didn't have any. Before I showed up, she ordered a sugar-free vanilla coffee and was told by the girl cashier that they didn't have any sugar-free vanilla syrup. When I asked if they did (I had ordered this on my first visit), the cashier girl asked and magically they had a full bottle of sugar-free vanilla syrup. Strike two.\n\nWe then place our food orders. I ordered a sandwich with a \"V\" in the name. It's not on their online menu, but it is on the menu in the store. It has turkey, bacon, cheese and avocado. I pay and then find my seat. Shortly after ordering, the same guy who took my order comes out to our table to tell us they don't have any avocado! STRIKE. THREE.\n\nIf you like to be forced into ordering something you didn't want because what you do want is not being offered that day, go here. \n\nI've been here twice and both times have been complete failures. Absolutely abysmal service. \n\nThe three of us decided we won't be coming back.",

The topic of Mardi Gras came up, and I was like oh I was just down in New Orleans for my birthday. I mentioned a few restaurants that I went to and L\u00fcke was one that I brought up. The guy asked me how did you like it because when I went  customer service was horrible. \n\nI was like wow, I thought it was just me! Which brings me to this review. My fiance and I went there for a late lunch. Once we were inside we were standing at the counter for about 5 minutes before three of the hostess even acknowledge that we were standing there. All three of the hostess were standing  talking and laughing as if they weren't at work.\n\nOnce we were finally seated and given the menu. We quickly realized the choices were very limited. I ordered the Shrimp and Grits and my fiance had the Gumbo. My food was adequate, it wasn't gross tasting but it wasn't all that either. Now the gumbo my fiance had. Was not appealing at all. It was a dark thick gravy and it had very little Seafood. I'm from Baton Rouge Louisiana so I know traditionally how Gumbo should look and taste, bottom line it was not good at all. \n\nThe issue that I had was definitely the customer service, it sucked. For establishment to be that upscale and high-maintenance the hostesses were very unprofessional. \n\nThe two waiters we had made the experience a little better because they were very attentive and concerned about how our experience was but I probably won't be back.",

We got to the restaurant with a bottle of wine and both of us were very hungry. We were seated at a table, given menus and the hostess opened our bottle. We chatted a bit, had some wine, and looked over the menu. The first 5 minutes we were there the waiter came over 3 times to ask if we were ready to order the menu is huge so it took us some time. We finally ordered, food came out quickly, very quickly. The server paid no attention to the fact that some of our belongings were on the table (keys, cell phones, etc) before we could move anything he placed our plates directly on top of everything. We ate, food was good not great, we split 2 rolls and a bento box, with the intention of ordering more if this was not filling enough. Before we finished eating we were brought our check, which destroyed any possibility of ordering more. We ate all the sushi and were picking at the bento box and drinking our wine when our server came over to take our check, my friend stopped him because we had not put our money in it yet and explained that we were still eating and drinking and not ready to pay. Then the waiter said \"So you can't pay your bill and finish your food?\" so so so rudely. We both stared at him in shock as he continued to rush us to pay him and get out of the restaurant. I have never experienced anything like it, mind you we were not even there for an hour when this occurred. We were so uncomfortable we did not finish the food or wine and just left. We won't be back, mostly because it was the weirdest, most rushed, rudest service I have ever experienced.",

At $15 for an entree, it should be served hot.  Right?  He apologized and offered to have the kitchen make us new meals, but we had already been there over an hour and could not wait through that process again.  We ate the remainder of our meals, and were really not surprised when we got the check and no discount whatsoever was there to at least attempt to make amends for our awful experience.

I ordered a classic grilled cheese sandwich, which is supposed to contain - you guessed it - just cheese. However, some of the staff members seemed distracted while they were making it. I didn't think anything of it until I got in my car and started chowing down. I thought it was odd that the sandwich tasted spicy (like, reeeeeally hot spicy) but I was SO hungry, so I kept eating half of it. Then I tasted something funny. When I opened up my sandwich, I saw turkey. Now, for most people this would not be a big deal, but for me, I've been a strict vegetarian since I was a kid, and meat makes me really sick, so it was a big freakin' deal. Made me throw up. Now I'm grossed out and sad because I used to love 'feine, but am now really disappointed - they should have been more careful.

I also ordered a salad with the cold hard pizza which they left at the store. They said it would be over an hour before they could go get it. Never got it. And never got refunded. The second and last time I gave this place a chance they took over an hour to get to me once again and delivered my pizza and salad but forgot the salad dressing. I called the manager and was assured the dressing would be brought to me in 15 minutes. Needless to say it was another hour before I got the dressing. Do not waste your time or energy on this location.",

Normally not a big deal but thought I'd take it back to exchange for the correct sandwich. Upon going back the lady at the counter refused to correct the mistake.  In her mind I ordered the #10 because on the ticket that is what she wrote down. Her attitude was horrible and completely smug the whole time to actually make this a big deal. To not fix a sandwich order over a 2 dollar upcharge is absolutely ridiculous especially when I made the effort to drive all the way back. Then to add her lack of empathy is what really pissed me off enough to write my first review. Excellent business plan, lose customer over a 2 dollar mistake.",

    "text": "Buffalo Wings generally have pretty consistent service and food quality -- I mean, how hard is it to serve reheated chicken and beer?  Well--evidently, pretty hard.  We arrived at 5:45 -- pretty early for dinner -- and were told a 20-30 minute wait, which turned into a 45 minute wait.  That should have been our first sign something was amiss.  After waiting 45 minutes, we already knew what we wanted to order, so ordered immediately after being seated at 6:30.  We ordered a chicken salad, a burger, a wrap, boneless wings, and a kids mini corn dogs.  60 minutes later we finally got our food.  Our waitress was great, and came by every 10 minutes to ask if we needed anything (other than our food), but all she could say is it should be coming, it should be coming.  We asked if the order was lost, and she said she saw it up on the screen in the kitchen, and said she had confirmed the kitchen had seen it, and that the screen shows them how long a order has gone unfilled, so they should know it had been an hour.  She had even talked with the manger.  Despite this, it took a full 60 minutes to bring out 6 items which literally have 5 minute prep time.  The chicken on the salad, wrap, and wings had all been precooked and heated under a heat lamp -- they were all dry.  They also put dressing on the salad despite asking for it on the side.  The waitress insisted on the manager coming over to us.  She asked him several times.  He finally came over as we were trying to leave, and said \"what is the problem\" curtly as if the waitress hadn't already told him 10 times, before, during, and after our meal was delayed an hour.  When my 74 year old mother politely told him (remember, the waitress asked him to come over, not us), he replied \"did everything come out ok?\" as if the only thing that mattered was did we receive edible food or not after waiting 1 hour and 45 minutes.  The guy acted exasperated, like the whole thing was out of his control.  Dude, I hate to break it to you, but your the manager.  This place is bleeding money -- if you can't get food out in under an hour, you can't turn tables.  The faster you turn tables, the more customers you can serve, and the more money you make.  Also, the less the wait time, so less customers get frustrated and leave and are less likely to come back.  With an hour wait for food, less customers are going to come back again, including us.  Sayonara Buffalo Wings -- it was nice knowing you for 20 years, but after 86th/Ditch service/kitchen went downhill, we were only willing to give you one last chance, and despite having a brand new restaurant with a brand new general manager, you managed to disappoint us even further.  We simply have too many casual dining and bar and grill options to waste our time and money with you.",

How do you serve an end-cut rare ... and is always reserved for medium well to well orders. \n\nTerribly disappointed and all I wanted was a casual good NOLA meal.\n\nSecond chance failed miserably! Medium rare to rare in some sections of the cut. The quality was horrific, vainy and tough.

    "text": "We have always enjoyed this restaurant and the entire dinning experience. Last night was an example of how one individual can ruin the evening. When we had an issue with the To-Go order the manager basically told me to pound sand. We dinned in and at the time of seating ordered an entree to take home with the expectation it would be ready when we were finished. Unfortunately that was not the case and I was told when I received my bill that it would be an additional fifteen minutes before my take home order was ready because the kitchen was backed up. When I expressed my disappointment to the waiter, she sent Nanu, the manager over to speak with me. Nanu was not apologetic, did not offer concern and was certainly not  making my satisfaction his priority. I asked him to at least offer the entree to me for half price. He brought back my bill, said he charged me half for my take home order and quickly walked off. When I was leaving he was standing at the front, I told him that his actions were not acceptable and He was obviously not focused on customer service. His response was \"call corporate\". Wow, don't think I will be visiting this restaurant again. Management certainly does not care about the customer experience.",

However, the one manager that wore glasses had a little power trip over the outside windows being open. It was a beautiful 70 degree Sunday, so we decided to go to this location knowing it had a beautiful outside patio. We were very upset when we sat outside and the windows were closed during our dining experience, we asked for the windows to be re opened and he refused. He also refused us other seating to where the Windows were open for our dining experience. After walking ourselves through the patio to the dinning room we found multiple tables that would of accommodated our party. All in all our experience was unsatisfactory due to the lack of professional management.",

I ordered from Hungry Howie's on Pantano last night, it literally took an hour for the food to get here and then he forgot the drinks and the garlic sauce. He had to go back to the store to get it which literally took about 15 to 20 minutes so by the time our drinks got here we were already done eating. And another thing, do not use their split technique online, I split my payment between my debit card and cash and it put it all on my debit card. The delivery driver didn't even have me sign the receipt so I didn't realize that it was paid in full until I looked at my receipt. I literally complained about the service and this delivery driver thought that I gave him a $13 tip, didn't even say anything. I go in today to get my $10 back, because I only meant for him to have a $3 tip because his service sucked, and they're only excuse was, I'm sorry he's new. So you don't train your new guys to have the customers sign the receipt when they use a card? Because if he had, this whole ordeal would have been avoided.

    "text": "So we know we have many options out there when it comes to dining out. So tonight the kids wanted steak. We are from out of town, here for part business and part pleasure. \nCalled ahead seating, time was about 20-30mins, perfect, no problem. We arrived and waited for maybe 5 mins in the lobby. So far so good. There was 5 of us, so they put us in a booth that fits 4 ppl, and added a chair at the end. Cool, no big deal. Server, Stefanie came by, took drink order, came back and we were ready to order our food. So we did. She was very tentative, we never had to ask for a refill, not even once. That's good service right there. I will give credit where credit is deserved. So, we all decided on having steak tonight. Two youngest wants steak bites, med cooked, oldest daughter wants hers med rare, my ribeye med, and husbands prime rib medium. \nAfter 30 mins, 8:30 server says she doesn't understand why our food hasn't come out yet she will check, cool. Still no food. Food finally came out steak bites were cold. Matter of fact EVERYTHING WAS COLD. Ok, so food sat in the window. Got someone by the name of Jamie, guest relation guy and told him our food is cold, he apologized and took food to kitchen for recook. He said he would personally see it that they cook it right, HE NEVER RETURN TO OUR TABLE. Time goes by, veru slowly, watching every other table who came in same with us or even after us get their food. So we wait, about 9:25, the remake came out, ran by the SERVICE MANAGER, JODI. This was the first time that she ever came to us. Brought food, had the nerve to ask \" how are you doing\" I replied with angry and hungry, she had no apologies, NOTHING. Food still was not hot, two younger kids food was still well done. I even had Jodi touch the steak bites with her finger, and asked her if it was cold or hot. She said herself that it was cold. I asked her would she have let her kids eat that??? She couldn't answer me. At this point I'm pretty frustrated. She said what would I like for her to do. I SAID, IT WOULD BE NICE TO HAVE THE KITCHEN RECOOK IT STAT, SINCE WE HAVE BEEN WAITING SINCE 8PM. As a service manager or any kind of manager, she should be embarrassed to run the food out without looking at the ticket seeing that it was all supposed to be medium cooked. She could not, would not , do anything to keep me from being so angry, and so disappointed because we have never had a problem with any Texas roadhouse before. \nSo I told her to take the damn food away, and the kitchen manager AJ came out. I asked her to sit next to me and I explained what was going on to her. She seems to understand , but didnt know what to do. I told her, i want the owners business card, and some kind of compensation for being there almost 2 damn hours and my kids were hungry. They were very patience and to the end, still did not have dinner. \nHere's how I would handle the situation. As a sserver I would tell the manager immediately that the food is taking long. Then when food came out make sure manager would come by and check on guests. That never happened. So when food is sent back, manager needs to be aware IMMEDIATELY. And food will be recooked immediately, STAT, and go out to the table and apologize. That was not done at all. Instead she comes out , so unprofessional, and made situation even worse. \nSo i have NEVER been so angry ever at any restaurants. If i was the owner, I would call the guest back asap, and see how to get the guest back and give their restaurant another chance. I got the business card and did call Mr. Michael (owner) we'll see if he returns the call. \nIn the end AJ did get an approval from her owner over the phone to give us a certificate to return for two free meals for 2 adults. I wouldn't want to come back unless I get an invite from the owners and on the day they work to ensure that this does not happened again. So again we'll see if they will reach out to their guest concerns. \nOvtall, i wouldnt give this restaurant any stars for the food service, but for the server she was good. She still should have checked on her tables food and made sure it didn't just in the window. But she was busy, i guess I can understand.\n\nVery poor guest relation from service manager Jodi and Jamie never came back to check on us. \n\nIn the end, had to go else where at 10pm to get food for kids. I'm still pretty upset and frustrated with this restaurant. \n\nYou have many options when dining out, please do not go here.....EVER. CHECK RATINGS AND FIND ANOTHER TEXAS ROADHOUSE.",

    "text": "I've had two experiences with limoncello that we're both horrible service and have made me not want to come back...ever. First was my birthday dinner in late summer. It was very crowded and my friend and I were wedged into a tiny table in a window with a huge family party on the other side of us - we felt stuck in a little alcove, not to mention it was very loud. We ordered an appetizer of the fried calamari, and it did not come out in 20-30 minutes. When we asked about it, they said it would be right out, but our entrees came out first! \n\nThen, they had the nerve to ask us if we still wanted our appetizer. We said that we did, and it eventually showed up. They did not offer to take it off of our bill, and they seemed so busy that our dissatisfaction was the least of their worries. Our meal was definitely overpriced for the service we received. \n\nMy second experience was with their catering dept. I wanted to have limoncello cater my wedding. I called in October, made an appointment to come into the restaurant the first week in November to sample food and discuss my vision. They called and cancelled the same day due to a family emergency (which I totally understand!). But then I didn't hear from them in over a week to reschedule! I finally reached out and was told that I could make an appointment for January. JANUARY!?!?! I never responded and never went back. \n\nHorrible customer service in both situations.",

Service was poor- our server thought it was cute to sit down at the table while taking orders and gave a real \"put-out\" vibe at the end of the evening when our table of 6 didn't clear out immediately after paying the bill. Strike #1. Everyone agreed that the food, while not inedible, was nothing to write home about. I had Salmon With Lump Crab. portion of salmon was overcooked and the crab was not lump (I'm from MD I know lump crab meat) the hollandaise was greasy and the rice tasted like seasoned Uncle Bens. Also, One,person in our group is on a very rigid diet and requested that the crispy wontons be omitted from her salad. The server was insistent that she include them, and despite SEVERAL polite refusals, the wontons were still sent out on the side! Folks, that was just weird and inconsiderate to our fellow diner.Strike #2.  I'm a beer drinker, and enjoy craft offerings from microbreweries. I tried the IPA (okay but not balanced-bitter and over hoppy) and a Lager (beer flavored water is what I thought on my first sip) Strike #3. So, overall I felt Granite City was lame. Wouldn't recommend it and definitely won't return willing.",

    "text": "Vegetarians beware! I went to Fez last night with my husband and two of our friends. Our friends ordered the 8-course meat feast, and my husband and I got the vegetarian feast (we're strict vegetarians, and for me, it's a serious ethical/moral issue). They brought us the bastilla (a pastry filled with egg and cinnamon - one with chicken, one without), and halfway through our course, I realized that the bastilla the waiter labeled as vegetarian actually had little bits of chicken in it. Not okay. Then, they took away my husband's drink before he was finished with it (he wasn't looking and didn't notice - but it still was about 1/3 full). The service was terrible - we had to ask for bread three times before anyone brought us any, and the waiter was very inattentive. My friend decided we'd had enough and asked to just pay for the portion of the feast that we'd already eaten. They gave him a hard time but finally complied. SO not worth what we'd paid. It's a shame- I used to love this place, but I won't be going back. The last time we were there with friends, we each had maybe 1 drink each (6 people), and they put SIXTEEN drinks on our bill - yes, 10 drinks more than what we'd consumed - and tried to tell us we were too drunk to remember what we'd had. It seems like a lot of other Yelp reviewers have had similar experiences with fishy charges being added to the bill, so if you do go (I don't recommend it!), make sure you check your bill very carefully.",

However Wetzle's tastes amazing so I give it a pass. \n\nBut this place takes the cake in terrible costing and tasting pretzels! I think I HAVE paid less for a pretzel at Disneyland! And probably have had dog food that was richer in taste. (Why am I eating dog food? None of your business! Maybe I just like to know what it tastes like so I can write accurate reviews about poor taste, ok?) \n\nOk so I bought this pretzel anyway because I had a BOGO coupon, but it so wasn't worth it. Even if the pretzel had been $1 I wouldn't return! This pretzel was stale, stiff and overly chewy like a steak that was a crappy piece of meat to begin with and then got over-cooked. It tastes like they made it no sooner than yesterday and it was thin, yet not that crispy. \n\nAbsolutely hated this pretzel and I can't believe I was suckered into such a travesty by a stupid coupon from Tmobile! That's right Tmobile, I'm bringing you into this too- please don't ever pair up with this place again!",

Well, I continue on the path to the restroom and the manager, yes, the manager, had the audacity to tell me if I proceeded to the restroom that he would come on after me. I thought he was joking. But no, he was serious, then he told me I needed to tip the bartender before using the restroom, even though I hadn't sat down to order anything yet. I was clearly upset and walked back out to leave. The guy at the door was very nice and lead me back in to use the restroom. I decided after being treated that way, by the manager, that this was not an establishment I would be frequenting any longer, even though I loved the place. I went to the restroom and came back out and put $3 on the bar, because I needed to \"tip\" to use the restroom. Well, the guy at the door said that the manager had ASSUMED that we came from a rave across the street and that we just wanted to use the restroom. Well, his assumption lost him business, and I have been living in the Bay Area for 32 years. I'm pretty sure telling a patron you are going to follow them into he women's restroom is some form of sexual harassment. I have NEVER been treated like that ever in an establishment. Hopefully, for the greater good of the restaurant, that manager is no longer there.",

Anyway we decided to order seafood delight with brown rice, vegetable lo mien and a half peking duck with sticky buns.  First of all seafood delight was served on a sizzling skillet which cooled down quickly. Also, it was served with a small portion of brown rice. Maybe its my fault I should have known it was an individual portion and not served family style.  The lo mien was Ok but again it was a small portion.  All of this would have been OK but the peking duck was the worst. I was really looking forward to the sticky buns and to my surprise when the duck came out it was served with cold flour tortillas! When we finished my Mom was still hungry and wanted to order more food (we are not really big eaters).  One saying grace were the fortune cookies that we enjoyed with our hot tea.  When we left the only people eating in the restaurant was the family that owns the restaurant.  I should have gone with my Mom first instinct to have fish and chips for my birthday dinner at McMenamins.",

We don't usually complain about much, but this date night was a disaster! \nWe came to this restaurant at 6 on a Friday night. \nThere was nobody to greet us, so we sat ourselves. We didn't get any water, or even a hello for at least 15 minutes.\nWe saw a table of 2 and 4 leave because they were waiting so long. We were literally about to leave when we got service.\nWe got our drinks rather fast considering the lack of wait staff.\nI got the pork chop and my wife got the half of a chicken. My pork chop was the size of a filet mignon and had some mashed potatoes on the side with some beets on top. Kind of expensive at $20, but rather good.\nMy wife's chicken came out hot, but she cut into the drumstick and it bled all over her plate. The waiter came back and apologized and took her plate promptly. He brought back another chicken about 10 minutes later and there wasn't as much blood, but it was still rather bloody. \nWe got our check and left.\nAs we were leaving we overheard the waiter telling another party that they're drinks didn't apply to the happy hour because they weren't sitting at the bar. They said they were not told that was the case. He said I asked you if you were here for the happy hour or for dinner.\n\nThis place has serious potential, the food I had was good, unfortunately, this experience ruined it for both of us. The beer is decently priced and there is diverse selection.\n\nIf you happen to go here, do not get the half a chicken!!",

    "text": "We made reservations for New Years Eve and I have to say that we were both very disappointed. The food was mediocre at best and the service was subpar. For a $160 meal for two we should not have felt rushed.\nWe ordered antipasto which was pretty good however they didn't wait until we were done or close to being done before bringing out the clams casino which I have made better at home. \nFor my entree I ordered a veal dish with crab and scallops. This dish was $32 and the veal was tough and got a sprinkling of crab and 3 scallops. The sauce was awful so my boyfriend switched his meal for mine. He had orange roughy which was $20 something. It was just ok. For dessert we had tiramisu and coffee which would have been enjoyable if our waiter didn't decide to fill all the cheese containers right behind us and another kid spraying all the tables down with cleaning fluid. \nThis will be our last visit to Ralph's. I would advise the same to others unless you have extra cash just simply to burn.",

    "text": "I have been to Gullifty's before for the karaoke before I was 21 and with a bunch of friends we would stay and eat and sing. \n\nAs of last night I will not be returning due to he unprofessional staff and rude confrontations that I had to go through with them. \n\nWe arrived a little after 10pm, waited for someone to sit us, we were sat in the bar area for a 4 top table by who I assumed was the hostess. Our server came, took our drink order and when someone wanted to order a draft we all had to pull out our ID's, which is fine. Whatever. The server informed us, as someone was under 21 at our table, that we could not drink out our table with them being underaged, so we decided to order our meals and us 21+ would go drink at the bar and come back. We get our meals, start to eat, and me and another guest from our table go to the bar to drink. \n\nWe finished what we were drinking at the bar and paid our tab, went back over to our table to continue to eat and our server came to our table and confronted us, it was around 11:00pm, he continued to explain about the law about drinking at a table with someone underage, blatantly ignoring our friend, and how it was just the law [which we understood, and which is why we drank at THE BAR, away from him] and our server explained to us how \"It was starting to get busy and that because we had someone underaged we could finish our meal\" basically telling us that he wanted the table. \n\nI was very irritated by the server, this was rude, we hadn't been there for an hour, our meals were cold when we received them, and he wanted to get rid of us?! Seriously? NO ONE had walked into the door after this confrontation, and I KNOW because I watched the time on my phone because i hadn't seen many people come in at ALL it was a Wednesday NIGHT! \n\nAgain, 2 from our table went up to the bar to drink, I stayed with our underaged friend. We sorted out our money for the check. The server CONTINUOUSLY passed our table after our money was ready, avoiding us, un-attentive to anything. He comes back apologizing to me and AGAIN paying no attention showing sympathy to our friend. He is apologizing for the law, I don't care. I know the law. I am upset he wanted us to leave, we WERE SAT IN THE BAR AREA BY STAFF i told him, and that's not my fault. I became very upset. \n\nAfter this I decide let's give this server the table so he can get over it, me and the friend under 21 sit furthest away from the bar and look for songs to sing for karaoke. At this point I am now being bothered by the Manager. Explaining to me that the kitchen closes in 4 minutes and that since we've eaten he can no longer JUSTIFY our friend being there. I'm Sorry, didn't know this was Gullifty's BAR. Our friend waited outside, not being able to even participate in the karaoke because of the continuous disruptions from staff and the rudeness that came with them. \n\nTrain your staff and put some signs up about the 21+ after midnight for karaoke. I will NEVER be going back. I'd rather set fire to my money.",

I normally frequent the one on 40th and walnut (so often that they know my name and order) and the people have always went above and beyond at that location. However, today I went to the Rittenhouse location and after ignoring me for five minutes, the lady wound up taking my order. I ordered 3 items off the menu and I tried to use my gift card. At first it got declined and then a manager came over. She checked my balance and it said 0.00$!!! I was devastated. Since my fianc\u00e9 doesn't really lie to me (why would he in this situation?) I am left to believe that when he bought the gift card, the worker pocketed the cash and never loaded the gift card. I'm very upset because I love the food so much, but this is unacceptable. They have lost a loyal customer and I will also warn others about the dishonest workers at this location.",

In fact this location is two miles from my home and I didn't know it was there!  As soon as I found it I made plans to go there the following Saturday for breakfast. Saturday came and I showed up there at about 8:00AM.  It wasn't packed with people waiting to be seated so I sat down in a booth and ordered an ice tea while I looked at the menu.  And then I waited, and waited, and waited some more.  I didn't even get a smile out of my waitress, some young girl who couldn't be over 20 years old.  She was all smiles and friendly to everyone else but I was simply and obviously ignored.  Have no idea why, I was friendly and certainly not \"that\" customer.  Over the course of 30 minutes I watched her smile and greet everyone that sat at the surrounding booths, but not me.  Finally I said to hell with it and put three dollars on the table and left.  I went down Shadeland avenue to a carniceria/restaurant that always has fast and friendly service.  I'll update my review in another month and see how things go.  This time I'll sit at the counter.",

My stuffed french toast was not cooked all the way through, and my fiance's breakfast sandwich was a mess.  I was also frustrated that my meal was served with imitation maple syrup in a plastic cup, considering our meal was $30 dollars before tip (you can add real maple syrup for $2, lol).  The hash browns were just terrible, they were slimy and tasted a month old.  The food was almost as good as a quality diner, but not quite.  The space is charming, but it seems like they have far more tables than the kitchen can keep up with.  We sat near the kitchen door and during our lengthy stay you could see the kitchen staff was barely keeping things together.  It's a shame to see a small kitchen working so hard with no hope of getting out of the weeds. The army of servers was very friendly and took our order promptly.  We had high hopes for Blue Plate, but have to say we won't return and wouldn't recommend it to others.",

I would not waste your money!\nFrom customer service to expectations all around (particularly in the dining category), disappointing and worse- overpriced!\n\nIf you like mega hotels where you literally walk miles from one end and back- this is the place for you.\n\nI give praise to the horticulture team because the gardens are amazing!!!\n\nChecked in a prepaid party of 5/7 of our rooms.  It was early am when we landed so of course they weren't ready for us but would call us when they were, no later than 3.  There was some confusion at check-in but we thought it had been taken care of.  Only to find out later, it was still messed up.  We received notice that our room was ready at 4:30 and collected our keys and attempted to get into our room, our keys were not programmed.  Luckily there was a house staff member who also tried our keys as well but eventually used his key to gain entry.  Once inside, the check-in issue that we thought was resolved was not: 2 female colleagues, 1 king bed.  Originally, we had booked & pre-paid for 2 separate rooms, they had asked of we would share- it was unexpected, but we were flexible.  That is until we found out 'sharing' meant the same bed!\n\nWe immediately contacted customer service only to wait in the phone system for 20 minutes and another 5 before they thought bringing us a roll away would be acceptable.  NOT EVEN!  So after going back and forth our mysterious reservation appeared and we both ended up with king rooms; however we missed happy hour with our team.\n\nThat leads us to dinner....the steakhouse was too pricy and Solario, the Conservatory bar and Ravello's were closed, JD's had a 45m wait so we continued to Delta Island where our disappointment grew into aggravation.  Now completely starving, frustrated and tired from travel and learning- we ended up at a fast food version of pizza, including: a cafeteria line, plastic trays, plastic ware and plastic to-go boxes.  A far cry from a nice sit down and get served kind of meal we were looking for.\n\nMy feet are sore from walking all over this place, I'm still hungry for real food and I'm exhausted and, well, very unhappy.",

Last time I was very disappointing with a chef that couldn't cook and had no personality. Was advised to ask for Steve and so we did. First, not an ideal table, with all homecoming kids- not the smartest seating by the host as they were dispersed through the house and each table had them and 1 couple. But, frankly the food was just ok as was Steve. Don't know what happened to the chefs that made dining there fun and delicious, like Chris. Chris where are you  now? Although they deny a change in management or organization there are many changes, not for the best which includes the tedious serving of soup and salad at the table by the server resulting in smaller portions and time consuming, smaller dinner portions and the food quality seems to have gone down as well. The good news, definitely not as crowded!",

The meat in the gyros was bland, dry, cold, and quite obviously not cooked on a spit.  The chicken tasted and looked like it was boiled in water.

It was probably cooked before and microwaved at some point, and it had  weird texture. The chicken was in huge chunks, it badly needed seasoning, and the chunks were extremely dry and tough. The rest of the b\u00fan was a ton of vermicelli noodles (though not exactly the right kind), some shredded iceberg lettuce, a little bit of shredded cucumber, and some bland pickled carrot and radish (no punch to that pickle). Overall, the dish had no flavor, even after dumping the fish sauce over it, and the meat was downright disgusting.\n\nMy wife's pho ga was not as good as the pho tai she ordered the time before. The broth was cloudy and had a thick layer of grease on top that needed to be skimmed. The chicken was horribly dry after being boiled for who knows how long. It still seemed to be missing some ingredient that neither of us could identify.\n\nI'm not eating here again.",

All of the prices have been raised and most breakfast specials are no longer available on the weekend when most people go there for breakfast. $8.99 for an order of pancakes with meat? Crazy. Waitress Ashley apologized for the new menu but then walked away when I said we were going to leave. Never offered to get a manager to see if he/she could offer another option, which is what a good waitress should have done. Instead of spending money on new menus leave well enough alone. I'll never go back. \nP.s. Do they realize that Philly has 2 L's?",

As another reviewer mentioned, they don't even out the dough so there was substantial more at the top of the pizza while the bottom was falling apart with the ingredients. The pizza was not hot, even after warming it for 20 seconds, very soggy, and the toppings were horrible (looks like they don't use real sausage). Pizza was very inconsistent, such as not being uniformly warm, sloppy, thin sauce, and cheese that easily slide off the pizza. Some of the guys look like they are in drugs, which is not surprising due to the poor quality of their pizza. This was one of the worst pizzas I have ever eaten! Folks that think this pizza is good need to have their head examined! I doubt those folks travel much outside the country let alone the local area. Delco standards are so low....:(",

The service industry is such a huge part of New Orleans, I've got nothing but admiration for the patience and hard work of servers. I had such a bad server experience at Backspace- it was bizarre, and seemed purposely directed, so much so that an acquaintance of mine also seated at the bar stepped in to call it out. \n\nAfter working 50 hours in 3 days at my Conference, I was super stoked to get a burger and a beer here after reading all the great reviews. Bellied up to the bar, asked for a menu, and ordered an Amber. It came in a plastic cup, which was the first strike when obviously dining in.  Then when I got my food, the bartender talked loudly about his bowel movements in front of me while I was eating, and joked about doing so. And here's when bad service felt like it was being done purposefully, I'm not a naive diner. My friend seated nearby comes to Backspace whenever he's in town, and called the server out (that's how obviously gauche the service was). \n\nNew Orleans is great for its choices when going out, and I'm happy to Yelp about those great experiences, and spend my dollars elsewhere.",

    "text": "Terrible \"convenience\" store. The only good thing about this gas station is where it is located. Even so, I will definitely NOT be returning to this place. Every time I've gone in there the employees are nothing but rude and not at all helpful. I went in there twice in one day and both of the interactions I had with the two different cashiers just left me appalled. The first time I went up and asked for ONE thing behind the counter and the cashier said \"what?\" So I asked nicely again and she still said \"what?\" And after asking her for the second time she then pulls out A headphone from her ear so I can ask a THIRD time. Then I had another encounter later that evening where the male cashier told me \"not to get smart with him\" when I simply asked a valid question about purchasing some ranch. There are just not any nice, personable people working in there. So if you stop here, I'd just get gas outside so you don't have to go in and talk to any of their shitty employees.",

    "text": "My family has been coming here for years and always loved it, but we had such a bad experience yesterday I doubt we will be back in awhile.  We had to sit on the patio because it was so busy, there was a festival going on, but it was cool, the fans were on and it's covered so we didn't mind.  Our waiter was very good and food was good.  Service a little slow.  However, toward the end of the meal, a lady right outside the patio decided to stop, stand there, and smoke a cigarette for a good 10 minutes, blowing her smoke all over my entire family, including my 10 year old son (it was his birthday), my older son, who has an autoimmune condition, myself, who has severe allergies and asthma, and other patrons including another young child.  When I asked the waiter if she could be made to leave (Florida Clean Air Act), his reply was, \"No, the ashtray is there.\"  So either Hellas provides a SMOKING AREA right next to their DINING AREA (disgusting and unhealthy) or the City of Tarpon Springs does and they do nothing to have it moved.  I was sneezing all night and diagnosed with a sinus infection today!  I left without visiting the bakery, and doubt I will be back for a long time.  Beyond disappointed!!",

    "text": "I originally would have given Red Robin 3 stars, but my last experience three weeks ago was so terrible that I just can't do that anymore.  My server was one of the worst I've ever had.  I just can not bring myself to go back for fear of getting the same guy and having this experience all over again. \n\n    Here is the breakdown:  First, he took forever to come to our table and even take our drink order.  I was about to get up and leave.  It had been at least ten or fifteen minutes before he ever acknowledged us at the table and the place wasn't even crowded!  It was a weeknight.  I could understand if it was a busy weekend and the place was packed, but I've been there on a busy weekend as well, and have not been treated like that.  However, I have on a weekday by a different server, but that's another story, and I left happy because a nice other waitress remedied the situation.  Anyway, this guy finally takes our order and then takes another ten minutes to bring me my water and then starts to walk off again.  I tell him that I would like to order.  I tell him which burger I want and that I want it to be a turkey burger, and with no mayo.  He looks really confused and takes about 3 minutes to write that down.  Then he repeats the name of the burger.  I say, \"Yes, with turkey and no mayo please.\"  He starts writing again for what seems like forever and then my boyfriend tries to order.  Then he starts to walk away and my boyfriend says, \"I'd like it medium-well, please.\"  He looked confused and was like, \"oh...\"   Then he asked me, \"How about you?  Medium well?\"  I said, \"Mine is turkey, so I would like that cooked properly please.\"  He said, \"Well, they're going to ask me how you like it cooked.\"  I said, \"165 degrees please, which is the temperature turkey should be cooked to in order to be cooked properly.\"  He tried to argue with me about it and then kind of laughed and walked away.  That is a health hazard under-cooking poultry!   What is wrong with this guy?  I don't think this guy knew anything about food or had ever waited tables in his life.\n\n    Then, I finally get my food thirty minutes later and it is slathered in mayonnaise. I try to get his attention for a while, but he ignores me, and I am so hungry at this point and this want to leave this place because this guy is annoying me that I just rip the top half off, wipe it off with my napkin and try to eat part of it.  He comes back about 20 minutes later when I'm about done and was like oh was it good.  I told him about the mayo and he said, \"Well, I didn't know that.\"  Then he just walked away!  Weird! He didn't say he was sorry and acted like it was my fault even though I'd repeated it twice when I ordered!  So rude too!  Finally, we couldn't get him to bring the check and had to flag him down again.  I thought I would never get out of that place!  It was the worst service I have received in a very long time.  Although I enjoy Red Robin's turkey burger, this service really turned me off to the place.  A lot of time will have to pass before I consider giving it a go again, if I ever do.",

At no time did they apologize to me for the delay, nor did they give me the reason and after that they are so unprofessional that knowing how upset I was and that there was a possibility that I would not return they did not make a miserable attempt to keep me as their client, On the contrary, as I had already been given a soda in what I expected the food, they gave me a full refund of my money but then they charged me the soda! Your marketing idea is on the ground! I will never go back to that place again. Very unpleasant experience to want to return.

It arrived, it was hot and delicious and filling, I paid and left. \n\nA couple hours later, I ended up feeling quite sick, and I wondered if it could have been something to do with my food, so I googled the nutritional information and found out that my pasta had egg in the pasta noodles, and dairy in the sauce. My waitress lied to me. \n\nI know it's not that big of a deal, I'm not allergic or anything, but come on. If you're not sure about the menu, ask. \n\nIf I could give 0 stars I would.

The food is decent and there's a good beer selection, but I'm tired of being treated like shit by the too-cool staff. The straw that broke the camel's back was my most recent trip, when a group of us went here after work.\n\"Hey what are the specials?\"\n\"They're on the board over there.\" Points to wall.\n\"Ah, yeah I can't see those from here, can you just tell me?\"\n\"I mean you can just walk over there... ah, well I guess there is [x,y,z]\"\nSO there were three specials. Three. Not sixteen or a thousand, three. And my servers idea was that all five of us should go stand awkwardly in the middle of the restaurant to go figure out what they were. If this was a pizza place I would understand. But the food is $15+ a plate, so it's not crazy to think that your server, who presumably enjoys receiving tips, could tell you the specials.\nSo I went to the bar area hoping to see the manager. I was told that he was \"upstairs\" and that \"he doesn't like to be disturbed. But I guess you could tell me, like, what the issue is, and I could like, ah, tell him later.\" \n\"Are you the assistant manager or something?\"\n\"Nah, I'm one of the bartenders.\"\nYeah. Great. So shit service and a manager locked away in his high tower. Hopefully this place will go out of business and become something that doesn't suck so hard.",

The pizza (which we waited 30 minutes for, though we were the only customers in the place) was thin and limp crusted, with rather sparse and unflavorful toppings. The Greek (Grecian) pizza was particularly \"blah\" tasting, and for some might even be considered disgusting. Very strange. Their somewhat Hawaiian-like pizza was okay, but just not anything special, especially for the money. Eclipse's pizza crust is supposed to be something particularly special, but Black Rock Pizza's is far superior by comparison. After this dining experience, my wife and I wished we had just spent $10 for 2 large 1 topping Little Ceasar's pizzas. It would have been twice as good and filling at a third the price. Don't bother with this place. It is more hype than substance. Not worth it at all.",

    "text": "This used to be one of my favorite places to eat. I have been coming here with my family for over 10 years. The food is usually great and the staff is quick. HOWEVER, we went last night to celebrate my brothers graduation and ALL of our seafood dishes had rotten shrimp in them. My brother is not very food conscious but even he pointed out that the shrimp had a bad taste. My mom and I tasted the shrimp from all the seafood dishes and had to spit it out. She told the waiter and sent back a few pieces for the chef to try, only for the waiter to come out and say that the chef didn't taste anything wrong with it and the best he could do was take 20% off our bill. We weren't looking to get any discounts, we were simply trying to make the staff aware of the rotten shrimp. My mom was mostly concerned about the chef's judgement. She has been in the restaurant industry for decades and was appalled when the chef said he didn't taste what was wrong. Those of us with seafood lost our appetite and left with our plates still full of food. Money and time wasted. Not sure if we will be returning, such a shame considering this was a staple restaurant for us :(",

    "text": "Great product, but horrible customer service online!  I live in New Orleans and brought my mother some pralines once on a trip home back to Maine.  She LOVED them and I started sending her boxes of pralines for Christmas, her birthday, even Mother's Day.  The customer service in the actual Southern Candymakers stores on Decatur Street is awesome.  Over Christmas, the stores were busy so I ordered them off the website to be sent to her.  I sent her a 3 pound box and she was SO excited.  She told me last week, she needed more so I went on the website again and ordered her a 4 pound box.  I placed the order on 1/14 and paid $30 extra for 2 day shipping via Fex Ex.  The order wasn't even sent out until the 16th and when she finally got them today, they were peanut butter flavored, which she does not like.  When I ordered, it said, \"You must choose a flavor\".  Original was the first choice and that's what I checked off.  I called customer service, and the woman that I dealt with, Linda, should not be working with people.  She basically accused me of lying, saying there was no way that there could be a computer error when I ordered, even though the order info also said my mother lived in Gorham, Mississippi instead of Maine and my old phone number was on the order, which I had corrected..  I told her that I've been getting pralines from them for years and spending at least $100 every time.  She finally said if my mother sent them back (paying shipping out of her own pocket) they would send her the original.  I am so upset after being a loyal customer for 5 years that they I would be treated so poorly.  I guess I will have to find another company to spend $300-500/year on,which is too bad because up until today, I would have stayed a loyal customer and always highly recommended them.",

Not only was my Ballast Point old but so were 2 of my Coronado's, some of the Green Flash, 3 of the 4 Sculpins! \nNo amazing citrusy tongue buckling hop flavors for me....just ridiculously malty flavors of an \"aged\" IPA. \n\nSo through the bottles I search. One of the Coronado's had a born date of 2011! Another had 01-23-2012, that puts it at over six months old. \nAll the Cigar City brews and more local stuff I got was amazing but there is absolutely NO excuse for year old IPA's!  Sorry guys, it looks like the beer department is amateur hour...this isn't wine we are talking about, IPA's DO NOT get better with age.",

How do they hire a person for the meat department that can not cut meat? Or a person for the fish department that has no clue how to filet a fish!\n\nWe were there a few days ago and I noticed that they had red spapper. Didn't like that they were headless because you really can't tell if they're fresh or not. No clear or cloudy eyes. Nonetheless I picked out 2 nice sized ones and asked if he would filet them. By the way he looked at me you'd have thought I had 2 heads. He got nervous and stammered that he could not do that. Geeze Acme....put someone in this department that can actually perform customer service!\n\nI was actually shocked to see that they had a crown rib roast in the meat department the other day. I didn't think they could do something that complicated. However, I might add, that for an expensive cut of meat as it was, it was horribly wrapped with bones cutting through the plastic wrap. Would you spend $55.00 on a roast that was exposed to....well....everything. Not me.\n\nPlease Publix.....Come to Philadelphia!",

Maybe it's because we had such great meals everywhere else while we were in Nola, but every single part of our meal was a disappointment.  The service was ok... a bit slow, and not terribly friendly.  I had a PoBoy which was just... lousy, and my wife doesn't even remember what she has (not because we had been drinking; he hadn't.  Just because it was terribly forgettable.)  \n\nThere are many other FAR-BETTER places to eat while you're in Nola, so please take your money there instead.

My opinion of this place has not changed... A sunday night dinner, with only a couple of tables seated - service still sucked royally! I did notice a sign posting for employment but with the minimal amount of people in this establishment during tonight's attempt it cannot be that they are understaffed.

I purchased the same coffee three days in a row and each day the price was different. Some days the price was 2.16 some days 6.56! That's a big difference and don't expect them to explain why. The quality of the coffee is just meh. Taste like it's been watered down. The chai tea latte has no spice some days. The one thing I can never understand is the total lack respect for customers at this location. I mean after being charged 6.56 for a cup of Americano I don't want to listen to you complain about customers dropping king cake on the floor and arguing about who should clean it up. Do your job.

We should have walked out then, but we thought the food would make up for it. Wrong!  This waitress kept having her table's food and drinks being returned for being wrong.

Every time I saw the waitress, which wasn't often, she said it was on it's way out. When it did come out, the jambalaya was cold and the crawfish etoffee was lukewarm and the gumbo had no meat in it.

    "text": "The beer selection really is fabulous, but with Drafting Room up the road and Victory a few miles away, you have to have good food and equally good service to win over those competitors. \nAfter several visits, today was easily the most appalling service out family has ever received from any establishment, ever! From the level of irritation of us walking in as the staff was just setting up (we walked in at 10:45am, the restaurant opens at 10:30am as posted on the website), for brunch, to the series of unreal circumstances that took place over the next hour, I am still in a state of shock. We were ignored for the first ten minutes, despite my asking if we had somehow arrived \"too early\" and getting a simple \"you're fine\" in response, no eye contact, and no attempt to counter the whispering in each other's ears and rolling their eyes at us. \nFast forward to the meal, we received our appetizers of tater tots and then our waitress, Katie, went back to drinking beer at the bar with the other servers while we sat in search of ketchup. I finally got up and went to the bar to ask the gentleman bartender for ketchup. Katie then retrieved two sides of ketchup for us. When I said thank you, her response was \"sure\". (Also, I can look past the blond hair that was inside our tots but it was adding insult to injury at this point.)\nOur breakfast came, the food was indeed good but the service was soooo bad. My two boys eventually went to sit on the leather couch and play together, clearly disturbing the on-shift wait staff eating at the bar and chatting. When my boys walked back to the table they were saturated with the smell of body odor from the couch. I mentioned to one of the male members of the wait staff, that the leather sofa smelled and that they might want to wipe them down when the day was through. He said \"oh, really, I can't tell, my sense of smell isn't all that good\" and then \"we'll make Katie take care of it\" as he walked over to Katie and another female to openly mock me for making a comment on the couch. All of this in front of my children, the oldest of which was completely confused by why his mom was being made fun of. Not the example we set for our children. \nWe will never, ever, ever be back to WOB Exton and I will recommend skipping this establishment to every person who will listen.",

First, had to call back 3 times before we could place order, they just didn't seem to have any of the favorites.  Fine, so finally it became a conversation about \"well, what do you have?\" Please note, it's not like we called at 2:28 for lunch, it was a reasonable 11:45 or so.  Second, delivery was ridiculously late, maybe being from NYC I have higher expectations so I'll give them a pass on that...maybe.  Third and the final straw, the food was HORRIBLE!!!!! I don't even understand how they felt that what they sent out was acceptable.  How does a Dominican restaurant screw the most basic thing-Rice.  It was stale and crunchy...and not in a bibimbap way....which I love but not with my chicken stew that was void of everything but chicken.  The only redeeming item were the sweet plantains and I assume that was because it didn't require much intervention from the chef.  \nWas this just an unusually bad day for a restaurant that thus far has been pretty good?

(Side note: the bread is served from a bag, it's light and crispy on the outside and airy  on the inside... It tastes good but easily crumbles) \nThe waitress wiped the table but left a considerable amount of crumbs on the table ... Afterward, the waitress called me a \"neat freak\" , not once but twice ... The neat freak comment was completely inappropriate. \n\nSecond, the waitress was unfamiliar with the menu. She did not seem to know whether or not the shrimp in the various dishes was deveined. \n\nMy third issue was with waiting 40 minutes for the crab cake appetizer. One crab cake is $18. The crab cake was actually good and savory, but it was disappointing waiting 40 minutes for one crab cake ... \n\nOur main course arrived about 15 minute after the crab cake. \n\nI ordered the shrimp and angel hair pasta. The buttery taste overwhelmed the dish. Since the dish lacked acidity, I requested lemons from the waitress. The taste of the pasta was not a big deal ... Nothing a little lemon juice couldn't fix. \n\nMy fourth issue was with the waitress bringing the small cut lemons from the bar, instead of lemon wedges ... \n\nThe lemon cuts were so small that I was unable to squeeze lemon juice from the lemons ...\n\nOverall, I wanted to enjoy Mr. B's more than I did...

After waiting patiently for our slices for over 30 mins, we went up to the counter to ask about what happened to our orders bc the large group behind us had all received their food and finished eating. Well, somehow although we paid for our slices our order was lost. Then when she immediately redid my order it was completely wrong, and they ran out of what my friend order. At this point we were hungry and cutting it close with time, that we just ate what we had to fill our stomachs and left. Prob will not be back.

    "text": "I used to love Red Lobster but last night will probably be the last time I go; especially to the Fairview Heights location.  \n\nThe wait was horrendous.  We were told it would be about 45 minutes.  We checked back with the hostess after it was getting close to an hour and we were told it would be about 10 more minutes. Okay, it is a Saturday, still not bad, right?  Finally after waiting one hour and 45 minutes we were finally seated . . . . and after numerous people that came in after us were seated.  Everywhere on the internet it says Red Lobster restaurants don't take reservations/call ahead seating so my bad for not actually calling to make sure as apparently they now do.  Most restaurants won't book large parties on a Friday or Saturday evening or at least keep them to a limited number, especially between the 5 pm - 7 pm rush time because . . . it's a Friday or Saturday evening and they are already extra busy.  Not here - there were probably 3 or 4 large parties which I guess was the reason one family of five had to wait almost 2 hours!!  If they would have just told us upfront that it would be well over an hour wait, we would have never stayed.  Apparently that is what they tell everyone that walks in because they continually told people that came in after us it would be 45 minutes to an hour wait (they did add fifteen more minutes on!). Maybe the hostesses just need more training in figuring out semi-accurate wait times but I recognized them from previous visits and they've all worked there for years. This would lead you to believe they are just not honest with people in hopes of not turning customers away.  I totally get that it was a Saturday and expected to wait but not for almost two hours and not one full hour longer than what you said when we walked in.  That is by far unreasonable.  There were actually smaller parties that came in right after us (not call aheads either) that were seated, ate, and left before we were seated.  I guess a party between 4-8 throws them into a conundrum but they can handle smaller groups and those with over 10 with no problems.  I guess we were really the fools because once we were seated, there was hardly anyone left still waiting (many had already given up and left).  Honestly, we sat there patiently and only asked once nicely where we were in the wait.  Funny how a few people that we are pretty sure came in well after we did, but loudly pitched a fit about the wait were seated right after they complained!    \n\nNow to the food - menu selections seem smaller and prices are way too high for the size and quality of the food.  They've really just gone downhill over the years - the second biggest reason I won't go back.  The food was just average, if even that - let's face it, the Midwest typically overcooks seafood so it ends up tough and rubbery with little flavor.  The same can be said here.  The only thing that tasted excellent were the cheddar bay biscuits - still exceptional!     \n\nThe only saving grace to the evening was the great waiter.  I don't recall his name but he told us he was originally from Miami.  He was a very attentive waiter and was very friendly.  If I were only giving stars for his service, it would have been 4 or 5 stars for sure!",

    "text": "First off let me start by saying this review doesn't reflect the taste by any means, because the burgers, tots and shakes are delicious. However, the service and the care for the customer are much less to be desired. This afternoon my wife took my two boys (3 and 17 months) out with a friend's family that's visiting from out of town. Naturally Burger Republic was the spot of choice since they wanted some great burgers. The trip quickly went downhill. My oldest has a pretty bad gluten allergy so they specifically requested the gluten free bun for his burger and let the waitress know. When the food came halfway through the bun they noticed that it was eerily similar to the rest of their regular buns. When they asked the waitress about it she then asked the kitchen staff and then informed my wife that the bun was in fact not gluten free and she was sorry about that. That to me is unacceptable. Although she apologized, nothing else was done after that to make the situation right. Now I have a son who's crying because his stomach isn't feeling well in between taking trips to the bathroom. If nothing else a manager should've been notified and/or the meal should've been comped. Luckily my son's allergy isn't as bad as some have it and he didn't have an immediate allergic reaction needing medical attention. Needless to say that supposedly great trip for out of town friends has now turned a days worth of fun activities into a day of back and forth bathroom visits and crying children. NOT COOL! Needless to say I can't in good conscience recommend Burger Republic any longer. Regardless of the great food, if they can't pay attention to the customer for something as easy as a gluten free bun request who's to say that the next time this happens there won't be serious consequences.",

Prior to ordering, I asked our waitress if the cafe makes their own corned beef and she said No, they buy it, cut it in the kitchen and make corned beef hash out of it. So I assumed that I will get real corned beef hash. After 30mins or so, the waitress came out with my corned beef hash looking like it came from a can - unless they use a blender to cut the corned beef, anyone will know the difference. I just wished that the staff are knowledgeable with the food that they are serving. This is not cheap breakfast and I don't mind ordering other things on the menu if I was properly informed.",

Still, it's a neat venue and thought I would give it another try. \n\nThe second time we were greeted with horrible customer service, so bad that we left without ordering. We arrived at 10:50 am for brunch. Apparently the kitchen closes at 11:00am. We were unaware. We stood in line behind about 10 people for close to 5 minutes. At 10:56 the cashier angrily came over and announced the kitchens closes at 11:00 and they are cutting us off. No apology, not even any eye contact. She pointed to the person standing directly in front of me and said you are the last to be served. There was only 2 of us left. She wouldn't even accommodate 2 more people 5 minutes before the kitchen was closing. She, Rae as we later asked for her name, does not understand customer service. We had been patiently waiting and had arrived before the closing of the kitchen and she didn't even have the decency to apologize. She stomped away and was abrupt to ever person that came to her register next. We left without even ordering coffee. We were not going to stand for horrible service and give these people our money.",

In the last two weeks this location has gone drastically down hill! \n\nLast Sunday, I waited in the drive thru line for what seemed like forever. Once I got up to the speaker I placed my order and was given my Total. When I finally made it to the Window, they asked what I ordered and told me that it looked like my order hadn't been entered. I gave them my order two more times then paid. When I was handed my Medium Iced Coffee (black) and Medium Iced Coffee with Milk and Carmel Swirl, it was very clear one of the drinks was incorrect. When I mentioned this to the girl in the window she proceeded to raise her voice at me and tell me the drink was in fact what I ordered. The Manager finally comes to the window to see what was happening. I calmly told him that I ordered a Medium Iced Coffee with Milk and Carmel Swirl and the drink I received was incorrect. The girl in the window began yelling that I had ordered an Iced Carmel Mocha. The Manager did remake my drink, but neither him or the girl in window apologized for yelling at me and telling me I didn't know what I ordered.\n\nNot ready to give up on this place, I went back this morning to get the same two drinks. Again they handed us a Carmel Mocha, and argued with my boyfriend when he said the drink was incorrect. He tried the drink that their request and when he insisted it was incorrect they continued to say it was in fact what he ordered. We eventually left with the incorrect drink because we were tired of arguing and needed to get to work.\n\nThis location needs to get it's act together and learn some Customer Service or it will permanently lose our business.",

    "text": "Aloof and unappreciative of this customer- we bought a custom cake (a bit over $300) and they wouldn't let us taste any flavors (they were all \"unavailable\" ) We got vanilla and chocolate because who is going to take a chance on lavender goat cheese when it isn't available to try?  They didn't give us any of those flavors to try either, but a chocolate cupcake was available for purchase (why thank you!) the vanilla we took a chance on (it's vanilla). They also kept telling me that most everything would be \"over our budget\". Idk a budget of $300 for a cake for about 25 people doesn't seem cheap \u200d-  (granted we aren't Beyonc\u00e9's crew!) Also, our event was early December and the manager didn't return my correspondence promptly, and when she did get back to me, her excuse was that they were so busy with thanksgiving pies (I feel valued!) We decided to go here because of reviews, their cupcake wars win, and to support a new(ish) Philly bakery, and, by the time we figured out that it wasn't panning out to be a good experience it was too late to change bakeries. But, if I could do it all over again, I would find a place that appreciated us, our money, time and occasion; hope this helps you do the same- unless you're Beyonc\u00e9 then you're all good ;)",

I went there with a few friends for a quick bite, and they screwed up 4 out of 5 orders. Not to mention having to ask for the complementary chips, silverware, and side dishes about 10 times. Also, they brought all of our food out at separate times. The first person got his dish 15 minutes before the second. It was just mind boggling that this place is owned by The Bayou, which is one of my favorite stops in Manayunk.

My last review was a 2 and I decided to go back and try it but seriously NOT GOOD!. \nThe quality of the meat is terrible, steak is chewy gross ness and the chicken is blah, almost not edible and i think mine wasn't cooked completely.  They cook everything super slow and one at a time so half your meal is either going to be cold or you'll be full by the time you get the other half of your meal and the service is meh too!\nIf they didn't have the free birthday meal thing going for them, i'd have to say they'd be going out of business based on the quality of the food and service. Their prices are also insanely expensive compared to others i've been to. Brandon didn't even finish his steak it was so terrible, when a man doesn't finish steak, you know it's bad!\nDefinitely won't be back again, so many other better options in the area for hibachi.",

It took over an hour for our food to arrive an when it did, everything was over cooked and dry. We mentioned it to our server and she completely ignored the situation. I finally stopped our waitress after watching my husband chicken down the swill they served us and asked her to redo his meal.

    "text": "I read the reviews and really wanted to try this place. We both tried the higher end restaurants inside the French quarter and wanted something more of where the locals go to for day to day meals. We patiently waited in line to get a table. The waitress/hostess ignored us and took everyone else's name down. Even the larger party that arrived later than us and requested to get some beers and wait outside was seated before us. I went up to the hostess and asked if she can put our name down on the list and she said wait a minute. We patiently waited again and after she seated more guests, I went up to her again and asked if I can put my name down. She then asked if we can wait at the bar. We walked over to the bar and waited another 20 minutes and watched her seat more guests that once again arrived much later than us. At this point I asked if we can have our table now and she said she will seat us once a table is available. I asked why she couldn't give us the table next to the bar and she said that table is taken. I looked around the entire restaurant and saw that we were the only Asians. I asked again when we can get a table and she smirked and said we can wait a minute. At this point we decided that we did not want to give our money to a racist establishment. I get that she MAY have forgotten to put our name down, which is what she told her manager, a very nice gentleman by the way, but that does not forgive the fact that she smirked when we asked about the table on multiple occasions. It doesn't forgive that she deliberately sat everyone who came in before and AFTER us and kept telling us to wait. If I was the owner, I would have fired her on the spot. No matter how good the food may be, which we didn't even get a chance to try, because this racist hostess/waitress ruined our dinner plans, it's not worth our money to be treated like a second class citizen. I would have expected more from a place that has such a long history of oppression and inequality but boy was I wrong. This hostess truly ruined our visit to NOLA and I would NEVER recommend any of my friends or family visiting NOLA to come try this place. It's not worth the headache or experience. Terrible customer service by a racist hostess/waitress that claims she is right. Please stay away from this place and beware! Please note the date we visited this place was 8/14/16 at 4:30pm.",

When a waiter did finally arrive he offered no explanation for his tardiness. We ordered our drinks and meal all at that point, as it was lunch time and we didn't have all day to wait. Little did we know all day was what they had in mind. We\nwaited over one hour for two sandwiches. The waiter never apologized for never refilling our drinks or for the long wait times for food. An observant manager noticed our perplexed faces, and lack of food or drink, and asked if everything was alright. We informed him that all was not in fact alright and he brought us water and was very apologetic when we told him we are locals that come in all the time. If they were busy maybe I would give them a pass, but that was not the case. John Besh, if he's still involved, needs to get a handle on this place or it is going to be a memory.

Its a 2x2 sweat box from the kitchen and you couldn't move sideways in there if you wanted to. They false advertise for half of their menu. Example:\n\"Ham and cheese omelet with your choice of toast, bagel or grits, 2.99\"\nWow \"Ill take it you reply.\" You get your bill 10.00. Scratching your head you ask \"how that could be?\" The answer, the cheese cost a 1.00 the bread 3.00 and so on. Shoot I'm surprised they didn't charge for the egg too. To top it off the food tasted like s#$% ran over twice. I could cook a better breakfast if I was drunk on bourbon st. Honestly, service was crap, it took two hours for a Dennys breakfast and it was off a street I couldnt even find. LAME",

There was a fair amount of people in the bar but it was by no means packed. We stood at the end of the bar for about 10 minutes waiting for the bartender to come take our order however she was in a conversation with whom we later discovered was her boyfriend at the end of the bar.  Finally a waitress came over and got us a few drinks. The guys attempted 3 games of pool but the table was not working correctly and wouldn't release the cue ball. My brother wanted another drink and waited again for quite a bit at the bar while the waitress ignored him. Upon closing his tab and paying for cash, the waitress did not return his card to him which prompted a trip back in the morning. As we were leaving, there was a fight breaking out in the parking lot between two men. If you're looking for working pool tables, a safe environment and good service then skip the Nite Owls Saloon and Grill.",

    "text": "If I could give negative stars I would do so for this hotel. I read other reviews and thought it would be a nice spot to stay in Tucson. They were also offering a spa package, which was a plus. I booked 2 nights in order to get the spa package. When I arrived I was told my room wasn't ready, so I went to the casino and played some slots (which were so tight as to be almost comedic). I finally got up to the 7th floor where my room was, and when I opened the door thought I was walking into a giant ashtray. The hallways reeked, but I thought maybe the rooms would be better. They are not. You cannot open a window either, not even a crack, to emit fresh air. The AC itself was merrily blowing a nonstop stream of what appeared to be straight cigarette smoke. I shut it off completely. When I called down to the front desk I was treated rudely, and I informed them there was NO way I could stay 2 nights in the giant ashtray room. I'm now waiting to see if they charge me for the spa that I am also not going to be able to go to.  The room was also nasty and dirty. For your pleasure I snapped a couple of pictures. The beds smelled as though the previous occupants bathed in Drakkor Noir. The cherry on top was at 03:30 an impassioned Mexican couple in the room next to mine had sex for 2 hours. I learned Spanish words I had never even heard before. How this glorified Holiday Inn ever got \"4 stars\" is beyond me. It's reeks, is filthy and the staff is rude.",

I wanted to sit outside, but there is no outdoor seating, just a spattering of chairs and tall tables with stools inside. I decided to stand at the table while I waited for my iced coffee, which was supposed to be made using their roasted Rwandan blend.\n\nNobody gave me an indication of how long it would take, only that my name would be called. They were nice enough when they communicated that to me, but I still went in with the expectation that it could take up to 15 min. After 15 min, I started internally debating if I should make an inquiry about my $5 iced coffee. Then, I decided I'll wait a little longer because I don't think I could appreciate the taste of a beverage hastily made for someone who was starting to get agitated.\n\nThe waiting continued, and then I started to think that my name was whispered and someone stole my cup (or they just took my money and ignored my order completely). I stood there, coffeeless and waiting, for nearly 40 min. Then, I just came to the conclusion that one comes to when they realize they weren't really that invested in the first place, which is \"fuck it\". I didn't bother to even ask what happened or try to get a refund. Keep my money. I am too poor to be spending money on overpriced coffee anyway. That transaction will stand such that I just purchased a fresh batch of casual contempt.",

The guacamole was too plain, lacking salt and spice. The size was ridiculously small and disproportional to the amount of chips you get with it. We also had chicken skewers, that were described as \"sesame, garlic, ginger...\". It literally tasted like chicken with some super sweet teriyaki sauce. The rice with it was totally plain too. We had kale salad with ahi tuna. Also was lacking taste, and the size of kale and tuna was disproportional. Not worth the money at all.",

It seems that every BJs that I go to though seems to be under staffed and you can't get your order in.( like 15 minutes after we were sat). I think that your team needs to have some urgency and make sure all the guest in the building are happy. This whole concept of sitting your servers 10 tables at once and thinking they are giving above and beyond service is ridiculous. So food is great love your specials just you need to have a manager out on the floor assisting with guest and team members. This will boost your rating and bring back life long guest who will rave about you. I really hope this helps and I will be looking forward to a reply to know that this will be fixed.",

We paid $3.57 for literally 30 tortilla chips and a 1/2 oz of the worst salsa I've ever had!  We expressed our disappointment to the cluster of the b**chy 12 year old hostesses and their passive-aggressive response to us was to smile too sweetly and call out have a nice day\" as we left. My response was definitely NOT passive. It's no wonder this group had a falling out with the rest of the family - they suck and they definitely reflect negatively on the other locations. Do yourself a favor-pass this location by and drive 5 miles east on 54 to the best Vallartas in the area.",

We were both unimpressed but what leads me to leaving a 1 star review is what ensued after eating from here. 2 days later I had severe intestinal issues that pursued for days. After a visit to a doctor and them doing a culture, I tested positive for campylobacter. Campylobacter is transmitted through contaminated chicken and takes 1-2 days to show symptoms. Considering this was the only time I ate chicken in the days leading up to getting sick, I 100% contracted this food-borne illness from eating food from here. I'd strongly advise people to eat elsewhere unless you have a week+ free to spend on your toilet.",

    "text": "Went shooting this afternoon and worked up an appetite. My fiancee and I had the Flying Pie on State Street once before, so we were really excited to try the one closer to our home. \n\nWe decided to try and call Flying Pie in Meridian. The number just rang and rang. We tried 4 times, to no avail. Finally we just decided to go in. It was hard to get there with the one way street when traveling southbound on Meridian Ave. BTW. We walk in to the restaurant, and we see two families sitting down eating. While waiting in a one person line I decided to call the phone number to see what would happen....NOBODY EVEN FLINCHED to answer the phone. We got to the front of line and told the gentleman working the counter that we had to tried to call several times with no answer. He shook this off like it's a normal thing to not answer the phone and that it seems ok to do so. We were going to order anyhow, but then we found out it was going to be 45 minutes to an hour for TAKEOUT. This infuriated me after not being able to reach them on the phone,  then drove over, to find that out. Plus, the counter seemed totally annoyed and didnt care one bit that we were hungry and upset...almost as if he wanted us to leave. We left and I'm writing this in the parking lot because I'm so mad I feel this is more important than actually getting food that I'm so hungry for. \n\nThis company has great tasting pizza, but the service here at the Meridian location is absolutely horrible. They may be laughing this off today, but when more and more people turn to social media to find out where to go, they'll have dug themselves a hole too deep to crawl out of. No second chance with this location for me. Maybe I'll go to the State Street location if I'm out that way sometime.",

After spotting flour tortilla on the menu under a different item I asked him to place the tacos on that, they could even consolidate into 1 taco if the tortilla was larger. The answer was no. After explaining to the manager what happened, he spent 5 mins talking about how it wasn't kitchen policy.

Wrong drink and food given. When I come into the store to tell them of the issue I'm having they talk to me like I'm to dumb to understand what's going on. Even though they were the ones that handed me an order through the window with a girls name on it and not even close to my order. Don't be condescending toward your customers. The friendliness from this place is sorely lacking when it use to be one of the better places to go too. It's a shame.",

    "text": "My wife and I dined at TJ's tonight for date night and were extremely disappointed,  disappointed on many levels.  One level being the service (server 7021 on the receipt), she should never serve again.  She spoke like we were an inconvenience to her, never told us her name, and had a demeanor as if she did not care about anything.  She was short with every response and uneducated on the menu, she did not even ask how our food was that we barely touched.  Second the food was terrible.  We had ordered the calamari as an appetizer, way under seasoned, red sauce was bland and tasted like canned marinara.  I had dumped one cap full of table salt(probably 1/8 tsp) from the salt shaker into our 2 oz portion of red sauce and it barely helped.  Calamari tasted just like fryer oil with no seasoning in the flour.  I had the sausage Parmesan sub and my wife had the meatball Parmesan sub.  Terrible choices.  Meatballs tasted like a frozen product, with canned marinara sauce.  My wife ate 1/4 of her meal and set it aside.  The sausage Parmesan was even worse.  Sliced Italian sausage with, maybe peppers covered with slopped sauce and cheese, on the best part of the entire meal, the bread. When we picked up our subs they immediately fell through the bread onto the plate.  Annoying to all sandwich lovers.  Oh, the beer battered onion rings, awful.  Nothing else to say about those other than we ate 2.  Server 7021 never asked us is everything was okay, or if we enjoyed the meal and clearly from the almost full portions of food that we denied to go boxes for didn't send a message, I do not know what else would.  My wife and I will never return to TJ's nor recommend this to anyone.  This was the worst $56 I have ever spent on food.",

We explained this to Dorothy the hostess, she took us to a table directly under the overhead lighting.  We again asked if we could be seated at a different table, (the restaurant was not crowded, plenty of tables were available). She snapped back at us  \"this is only a restaurant\"..... excuse me.... I couldn't believe how rude she was.  She snatched the menus off the table and walked away, we found our own table.  So Cracker Barrel obviously does not make it clear to their employees to 1) the customer is important. 2) It is ILLEGAL to mistreat those with disabilities.  \n\nGo if you wish, but look out for rude hostess --- Dorothy!",

Although the food was good, the waitress was horrible We first ordered 1 soda   and 1 ice tea, and 2 waters she didn't bring us the water for another 15 minutes after we got the soda and ice tea.\n\nWhen we asked for 2 minutes-, that turned into 16 minutes We actually had to wave down the Hostess and ask where our waitress went so we could order. When  the host asked the manager where she was, he got her. The waitress came over to take our order Nothing- not even an apology or smile.. Not a \"Sorry for the wait\"\n\nWe ordered the Zuccini Frities, Chicken,Veal Parm. Food was all good. Bread was good.  We order the small portions. she screwed up the order- She brought us the regular sized ones. I made sure she didn't charge us for the regular ones - She in fact did and didn't take it off till the last moment- probably trying to sneak it by us hoping we wouldn't see so she would get a bigger tip.\n\nShe never came over and asked how our meal was. she never looked over to our table ONCE.After i got my meal i needed a drink refill. once again she disappeared for almost 15 minutes\n\nIt was around 3pm on a Sunday- there were plenty of servers, waitresses on the floor that night The restaurant was NOT packed. There was NO wait for our table when we arrived.And it it wasn't dinner hour yet. Our waitress appeared to be working only 4 tables in total.If it was any other restaurant That waitress would be catering to our every needs quickly and professionally with a smile on their face.\n\nI have been to many restaurants and 90% of them have better service than this.\n\nThe food was good but I would rather stay at home than deal with this sub par and rude service.\n\nShe messed up the order was late with the drinks, never apologized and disappeared alot \n\nTrust me guys, go to a better class area than Springfield or dont be surprised if you walk away disappointed with the service.",

Some other girls at another table had the same problem. I thought perhaps it was a new chef or something but now seeing all these bad reviews, I'm not so sure. \n\nSecondly, they have this advertised deal on the board and the waiter told us all about 25\u00a2 wings... The wings were ok, nothing special. But, here is the problem and we learned a lesson as we don't really look at bills for accuracy all the time. We had already had our card swiped and then I looked at the bill and thought it was pretty high for what we got. I saw that they had charged us 8.95 for the wings! I'd like to give them the benefit of the doubt that it was a simple mistake but something tells me this probably happens a lot. I'm glad I noticed. \n\nIt was nice to be able to sit out on the sidewalk and they will probably still thrive with all the drunk idiots that frequent this area at night.",

    "text": "Came in late on a Friday night past typical dinner hours to grab food with a friend. I ordered a chicken sandwich and my friend ordered the popular village burger. With my initial bite into my chicken sandwich, I knew something was wrong. The inside seemed tough and very hard to even cut with a knife, and I had my friend try it to confirm. My best guess would be they used frozen chicken but did not fully thaw it prior to cooking, therefore having a very hard middle! I quickly notified the server who sincerely apologized and I chose to go with a burger medium well. With the first bite into my burger, you could see a pool of blood oozing from it. Although I normally may order burgers medium rare or medium, I asked for medium well. The surprising thing was my friend ordered medium and his plate had not a trace of blood. \n\nDespite the establishment replacing my order quickly, which should be the standard protocol of any order that was messed up, I am highly annoyed/dissatisfied that I was not offered anything (free drink, the messed up order to be comped). \n\nI have been here several times and ALWAYS receive great food/service. The lack of customer service and a bad food experience has put a bad taste in my mouth with Village Whiskey and will not be returning there.",

We took the family out this past weekend, and were severely disappointed.  At first it seemed like it was going to be a great experience with the family.  The salads came out, I had to ask about my bisque.  It finally arrived after the reset of the table had finished their salads.  While I was eating my bisque the food came out.  My wife and I ordered crab legs with two premium sides each, instead of the regular sides that came with it.  Big mistake, she kept asking if we wanted the corn and potatoes or the rice and broccoli.  We wanted neither, my wife wanted lobster mashed and I wanted the aspagaras and burbon sweet potatoes.  We received the crab legs and the rice.  We told the person who brought the food out that is not what we ordered.  After we finished the crab legs , the sides finally arrived.  The manager did comp my wifes meal, but not mine.  Did not care about the meal being comp'd, but service has really gone down hill.  Of course we did not have our usual server either.",

The  restaurant started to get crowded with people, now we are half finished with out dinner, and our waiter comes back to see if we need anything. Now it's about 6:30, and we are still eating. Again waiter asks us if anything is needed. I thought we are just getting a good service. But again he comes again and ask anything is needed.  The lady manager comes to our table and ask if everything is ok!  Clearly she wanted us out, so she can have other people seated.  So we try to rush little bit so we can leave faster. Then our waiter comes back again, and this time ask us if we want out food to go! I was mad now, it was about 6:45 and we didn't even finish our dinner.  How can you ask customer if they want a doggy bag if they are still eating.   I understand people are waiting, but we just started to eat around 5:50 when food came out. How are they expect us to finish our food in 30 minutes and leave? Don't we have time to enjoy our dinner?

They kept staring at me and my friends while eating. It worth mentioning that this is all you can eat restaurant; however, in order to make us feel full quickly, they decided to put a quantity of rice double the size of the sushi. When we left some rice, they decided to charge us for it. They were not polite by telling us you're ordering too much quantities and that's why we concluded that they put too much rice. The girls serving was talked to us in a rude way and one of them used her finger tips to point to us while talking. I will stop coming to this place again",

I had to ask for a knife to dissect the chicken to be able to eat some of it. I will be surprised if my dog eats the leftovers that I bring him. Additionally, had to ask several times for water refills and it wasn't even crowded. Should have stayed with the cabbage salad only. \nNever again!",

During a recent visit July 7th the shift manager and wait staff had such the attitude - I found them to be pompus, arrogant and outright repugnant. The menu has erroded over the years from interesting to \"safe\". I guess the owner has lost his european flair and this now \"just another place\". Save your money and go the  champaign bar next door. Interesting food, great wine and champaign selection, attentive service and you can still enjoy the music from Tryst - its only 20 ft away.",

    "text": "BRIDES PLEASEEEEEEEEEE DON'T BOOK WITH THIS VENUE!! I booked with this venue in the beginning of my engagement after meeting with Pat. He spent the entire meeting discussing all the lovely renovations that would be done prior to our wedding taking place.  Pat said that the renovations would be done over the summer (well before my wedding would take place in June the following year).  A few months later (after little communication from my initial meeting with Pat) we had our food tasting.  The food tasting was an absolute disaster. From the food being disgusting and bland and tasting like high school cafeteria food, to receiving a $60 check afterwards because our mothers came.  We were completely livid.  But the icing on the cake was the zero renovations that still hadn't been done, months after we paid the deposit. The very next day I left Pat a voicemail and sent him an email.  I'm a paralegal, so I'm extremely thorough and attentive to detail.  I emailed Pat all of my correspondences with Melissa showing that she never stated that I couldn't bring our 2 freaking parents and asked for the full refund.  I also mentioned the renovations that he promised that clearly weren't ever done.  Pat became a completely different person.  He said the food tasting was only for the bride and groom.  I explained that it was never stated in any paperwork that it was complimentary for just the two of us.  Our mothers paid for the wedding, and I don't eat meat so I would like more than one person's review of this food.  I also asked how can you charge for additional food, when you still presented us with one plate for everyone to share.  He said it's their policy and no refund would be issued.  Then I asked about the renovations and why the venue looked exactly the same.  First, he acted as if he never made any promises about renovations, then after I kept asking several questions, he back tracked and said that it's hard to get the licenses for renovations in the county.  So basically, no renovations would be done prior to my wedding.  At this point I was absolutely livid.  First if you are going to nickel and dime me now for freaking $60 then this is going to be a long process.  Second, I would have never ever booked with that venue based on how it looked.  Everything in the ballroom looked outdated, the carpet was dingy and old, and the venue as a whole looked old, and I literally had stopped looking at venues based off the lies Pat had told us. So, I told Pat that I was unhappy and would rather book somewhere else and that I wanted my deposit back.  Initially, he said no.  Then when I threatened legal action, he gave us our deposit back immediately.\nTHE MORAL OF THE STORY IS DONT BOOK WITH PAXON HOLLOW. From Pat being a con artist, to Melissa they are just horrible and honestly seem as if they don't fully comprehend customer service.  Two weeks after firing Paxon Hollow, I booked with Regal Ballroom and we just got married on June 10th.  They were literally the polar opposite of Paxon Hollow. Netty, and Chris were so amazing and attentive. The food at the food tasting was amazing, we were allowed to bring our moms, the entire venue was brand new and by the wedding day they had even made some tweaks to the bridal suite, we were able to keep the same date as before, had a million times better customer service, and paid a lot less then Paxon Hollow.  \n\nP.S. See Dan's May 2017 review on wedding wire where he also outlines the poor customer service, the horrible food, and the \"renovations\" that Pat is promising to everyone",

The fajita was actually chopped up chicken (like you'd find in a chicken cheese steak). It was 9 dollars and absolutely not worth it- even to my ridiculously hungover want to eat something fatty and greasy self.\n\nNext time got another wrap- it came with fried chicken not grilled- okay my fault I should have specified but typically not used to getting fried chicken in a chicken wrap. Also flavorless and at 9 dollars not worth it at all. The honey mustard was gross, the chicken was over cooked and greasy.\n\nNext time- grilled chicken Apple walnut salad with mozzarella cheese. The mozzarella cheese was literally flavorless pizza cheese, the apples were completely rotten and mushy had to pick them out and toss them and the salad itself was wet so when the dressing was mixed in it was a watered down mess of a 10 salad. \n\nI give up on this place. Not to mention like others have said the owner is rude. I've asked questions such as \"does the Greek salad come with chicken\" and was answered condescendingly no it comes with feta. Um for 9 dollars without protein sorry thought I was missing something ?\n\nSkip this place is my suggestion I know I will be going the few extra blocks for more edible food that is less expensive.",

Yes McDonalds. I got a Woodstock and fries. The bun was about the size of a double cheeseburger bun at McDonalds, The meat really didn't have a taste to it, the bacon tasted like it was deep fried in two week old grease, and the fries seemed like were warmed up in the microwave. The \"homemade\" ketchup, not good either. Now, on to the service, I know these waitress's make low hourly wage and depend on tips, however, to get a tip you have to take care of your customers. I had to ask for coke, even though she walked by twice and looked at my empty glass ( I had already drank the melted ice) the third time she walked by I had to ask her even though she looked at the empty glass to bring me a coke. Then I asked for mayo Joe she said ok and then waited on another table. Maybe its just me but...The only smile I got was when I was leaving and then I bet she didn't smile when she picked up the receipt. I will not come back. And take heave, don't be like me.

It was bland and dry. \nThey give you a tiny (probably 20 chips) cup with chips no refill and \"salsa\" haha it was pico!! it had chopped tomatoes, onions, and cilantro. \nWe order chicken fajitas and nachos. The chicken was incredible dry, no flavor and orange! Nachos were ok. Nothing to rave but ok. \nThe place was overprice for the casual dinning experience and quality of the food. We just moved to this area from Texas and I must say, this place is considered mediocre on the south and for similar quality places, you would expect lower prices.\nOh, and lets not forget the \"we don't take credit cards\" and if you want to pay with a debit card, you need to get to the counter to pay and get charged $0.99 for using the card! WTH!!! You can tell a restaurant is cheap when they don't want to pay the fees for using a credit card and they make you- the customer-  pay for using a debit card. \nSeriously, you will better off going to chili's and get their generic Mexican food that at least taste fresher!\nWill not go back to this place nor will we recommend this place.",

Unfortunately I was thoroughly disappointed. My girlfriend ordered the Chicken Milanese entree and was shocked when a flat piece of fried chicken came out with a little potato salad on top instead of the beautifully described entree on the menu. Not what you would expect for the $24 price tag! Our friends both ordered the Seafood Risotto and were also pretty disappointed. We were embarrassed that this was their first impression of dining in St. Pete.  It was a shame to spend $120 dollars for four ppl on just food and no alcohol and not be wow'd to say the least.

Instead, we put a lot of salt on them.\n\nI had ordered the shrimp sliders...that was the WORST!!! There was NO indication that this slider had shrimp in it.

After putting a bunch of salt and pepper on it, I took a bite and the bun was overcooked; it was toasted all the way though. At this point, I just asked for the check.\n\nI'm glad they didn't charge me for those meals.

Since I've moved back to Tampa, thought I would stop in for lunch with friends. Michaels Grill has changed and it is HORRIBLE! The lunch menu is just sandwiches and salads, blah! The Service was awful! There were 3 empty tables outside and it was beautiful outside, but we couldn't sit there, they were reserved. So we had to wait for a table, even though there was a table open that seated 6, we were a group of four. They wouldn't let us sit there. While we were waiting for the table to be cleaned, a group of 3 came in and the hostess sat them at the table for 6!!! WTF!!! We finally sat down and ordered right away. We waited a very long time to get our food, the group of 3 at the 6 table got their food quickly, and so did a couple of tables who ordered after us! When the food finally came, they gave me the wrong quiche. I ordered the special, florentine. The waitress didn't notice that it was not what I ordered and went to fix it, but then she said they were out of the special. I looked over at a few of the tables that got their food before us, and ordered after us, they had 3 slices of Florentine quiche. Again WTF!!!! So then I asked why they were able to get what they ordered, when we ordered before them... She just said that our table had a sandwich that took longer than theirs! Really! So I just kept the shecrab soup. Which use to be amazing, but now it has a gravy consistency! Yuck! We were all very disappointed with the service! And the food is not up to par like it used to be. My friends thought the sandwich and salad were not high quality and definitely not worth the $$$. Sorry Michael, but you should just close lunch service or fix it!",

Food was mediocre at best and for the price I'd say was a major letdown. We had the duck spring rolls which were okay but at 7 dollars per roll left much to be desired. The bbq shrimp were okay and again for nearly $25 again left much to be desired. The eggs and bacon were decent. Two bloody Mary's were watered down and bland. The one star review is reflected by the service. We had some of the most inattentive service in NOLA (in about 10 trips over the past 5 years) and that's saying a lot as things here move at a much slower pace in general. Forgot coffee order, forgot Bloody drink order, no coffee refill, no follow up whatsoever from our waitress on anything and had to ask for literally every single item needed including utensils. The closest thing to a modicum of service I had was from the water guys. Walked out with $100 check for brunch and a feeling that they could care less about us as a customer. Also I should have known going in when I saw the host berate a more junior team member to nearly tears for supposedly mishandling customer checkin. Unfortunately they can likely get away with it because the place was packed.......sorry Mr. B but we won't be returning or recommending you.",

Two employees were making small talk with a female customer and a third was attending to a battery replacement for another customer. I waited with my wife for about 10 minutes and no one even acknowledged I was there. I finally asked the two employees who were making small talk with the customer if one of them might be able to help me and neither of the employees even turned my way, but instead made derisive comments under their breath to the female customer, who then explained how she was a 'customer' and she was being helped (despite having no items to purchase or having any kind of conversation regarding anything automotive with staff). I suspect she was an off the clock employee since she was the only one who would even address me. I located another Advance store on my phone, gathered my battery and began to leave. One of the employees finally deigned to offer to help me, but I wouldn't have taken a battery from that store if they were giving them away for free at that point. I went to the AAP on US19 and Central, where I received decent customer service and would return again. I will never set foot in the Gulfport AAP ever again, and I don't recommend any else do so either, unless you enjoy being ignored while employees conduct personal conversations with friends/off duty employees.",

But one thing I have learned , a bad review can only help a company better themselves . I enjoy Izzos & their food ! Anytime my co workers suggest eating there for lunch I always jump on the izzos bandwagon! This particular time I asked my co worker to pick up a side of guacamole from there for me . My favorite thing to eat from there . I won't lie , I eat slow and I pick through my food the entire time . After taking a few bites of the guacamole I noticed something oddly shaped mixed into the guacamole. I stopped engaging with my co workers at lunch and looked in shock. It was the \"butt end\" of a roach . Lol ! I thought I was seeing things because this recently happened to me at another restaurant about 7 months ago ! I looked again and realized it was indeed just that . I showed my co workers Just to confirm I was correct. I totally get it , it's a restaurant and sometimes ... Bugs get inside . Things like this DO happen . It wasn't their fault & I'm sure they try their best to keep things sanitized. But no one wants pieces of a roach in their food that they've been eating . All I can ask is that they keep a better eye on things ! Sadly I do not think I will be eating at any location Izzos again :(  .",

    "text": "I was visiting from out of town and excited to try Herbies. It was such a sad state of affairs. As a former St. Louisian, I am very interested in making sure businesses are thriving. This restaurant is doomed. The waiter was nice but everything took a ridiculously long time to receive. My friend ordered a French Onion Soup and it came in a coffee cup sized portion and apparently was bland. My other friend and I got salads that were unmentionably average. Then it took literally over 30 min to receive our entrees. My first friend ordered the veal chop and it was actually good. My other friend ordered the salmon and it was ok and appropriately prepared. I ordered the roasted chicken after bragging to the waiter that I am a roasted chicken connoisseur and he highly recommended their roasted chicken. I am not exaggerating when I tell you it was smaller than my fist (I am a petite woman). The drum stick portion was smaller than my pinky finger. It was actually very cute but ridiculous for $28. It was over cooked, dry and basically I got about 3 bites of actual chicken. We had to complain because I thought it was a joke. The waiter explained that these chickens are 28 days old when they are cooked. So they are basically baby chickens. If they gave two in a portion I could have understood the cost. When we complained, they offered another one to eat. It took at least 15 more minutes to receive this one and the waiter offered to wrap it up because it was obvious we were ready to get the heck out of there. We talked to the manager and he had no interest in our story. I'm mostly just sad that this restaurant was so bad and will likely not survive.",

Once food actually arrived, risotto was undercooked, Brussel sprouts were over cooked and missing side dishes. Notified server with no reconciliation until we mentioned it again. Finally got a pseudo-manager who's first priority seemed to simply get out of the situation as quickly as possible. We reminded him that we still had not gotten part of one of our dishes - he assured us that would be taken care of immediately. During this time our original server could be seen openly having a confrontation with multiple people and was subsequently removed from our service. A new server was appointed at which time we had to start over explaining the issues with the meal and still missing items.\nNeedless to say after nearly 2 hours we we just wanted to go!

Now, wings ALWAYS comes with some type of sauce whether it's ranch or bleu cheese. I ask for ranch and he tells me it's an additional charge. I've used all my cash to buy the food that I could've easily paid with my credit card. I ask if it's possible to just give me ranch with no charge and he says no. I walked away pretty disappointed.

    "text": "OK food... HORRIBLE customer service!\nOne weekend I ordered 4 extra large pizzas (totaling $65 WITH a coupon) and when we received our order it was completely wrong.  I called to report the issue and Adam (who claimed that he was a manager) said that he would \"take care\" of my order next time.  He also asked me to take pictures of my pizzas (which I did).  The following week I called Pizza Guys to place my order.  Prior to placing my order, I informed the girl of my arrangement with Adam.  She responded with \"Hmmm... hold on and let me figure that out\".  Adam came to the phone and when I reminded him of our arrangement, he took my order (which was the exact same order as the one they messed up on), he told me that the total was $88!  When I reminded him again of our agreement, he then stated that he can \"discount my order significantly\" bringing it down to $60.  I told him that I was not satisfied with that.  If I had them correct the order the first time, I would not have paid for their error then, so why should I pay for it this time?  Adam told me that was the best he can do... even as a manager!  I asked who his boss was and he stated that she was standing right next to him.  I asked to speak with her. He placed me on hold for about five minutes only to return and say that she sent him back to the phone and tell me that the best she can do was to bring the cost down to $55. Come to find out that this was the OWNER! She did not even have the decency nor respect to come to the phone and talk to me.  Instead of trying to correct their error, they acted as if I was just trying to get some free food! I have NEVER been so insulted nor experienced such poor customer service!  I will NEVER order from this location EVER again!  I even spoke with Director of Operations regarding the issue and although he apologized and asked for another chance, I told him that I would not feel comfortable nor would I put it past that staff to put something in my food!  In my opinion, customer service is just as important as the quality of food I am purchasing.  Again - I will NEVER order from this location again, and if you think that customer service is just as important as I do, then you won't order from them either!",

    "text": "This is the first restaurant review I have ever written but, this place was such a disappointment that I would like to save someone else from wasting their money and time on Ho Ho's like we did. First, I will start off with the positive. The Crab Rangoon was good and they were large. Sadly, that is the only nice thing I have to say. We ordered our food and the person I was with ordered extra pork with his fried rice and asked how much the extra pork cost and how much pork would he get. The young lady's response was, \"not very much\". He made a circle with his hand and asked if that was how much or more and she looked horrified and continued to say, \"not very much\". He went ahead and ordered it with an extra cost of $2.00 which is (2) extra portions of pork. There were 3 dirty bikes and 2 filthy high chairs in the VERY dated dining room. We pulled our chairs out and they were so dirty our hands were sticking to the chairs. We noticed the packets of sugar were from Ameristar and the sugar free packets were from another restaurant. Our drinks came in cracked plastic cups that still had the price tag sticker on the bottoms of them and the ice was out of a regular freezer and you could taste that it was old ice. It took forever to get our food. He ordered a Pork St. Paul Sandwich which came on the tiniest slices of bread with very old, dry pork. Until then, I thought all bread slices were the same size. I ordered Chicken Lo Mein and the chicken was horrible! It didn't even taste like chicken.The lo mein was spaghetti and there was so much soy sauce that it was soup. I asked for red sweet and sour sauce and the girl brought it out in and old honey container and the container was very sticky. Not from the sweet and sour spilling on it but, it was as if it had been sitting on a shelf by a fryer. There were big chunks of something in it. Finally, the person I was with got their fried rice to go that was supposed to have 2 extra servings of pork yet, it still fit into the usual small container and there was no extra pork. At that point, we just wanted out of there. I have been disappointed in restaurants but, this place made me angry. It was a COMPLETE waste of money and they obviously take no pride in the making of their food. The quality of the food or experience very clearly means nothing to the owners of this restaurant.

After this visit, I think I'll stick to IHOP.\n\nWe went in the early evening for breakfast for dinner, we were the only customers at that time, which we thought was good as we'd get a lot of attention. We were wrong. We sat down to a dirty table, our waitress was barely paying attention to us, and when it came to paying the bill, we had to get up and go to her after multiple tries at calling her over. \n\nFood wise. I ordered the All-Star Special that came with two eggs, toast, hash brown, waffle, and your choice of sides(bacon, always). The waffle was thin but nice and the bacon was crisp. The rest were just tasteless. Toast was more like warm bread, eggs weren't cooked all the way, and the hash brown had a dirty taste to it that I couldn't eat more than a single bite. \n\nSeating right near the kitchen also, you'd think they would keep it clean to keep up appearances. The place was a mess with dirty dishes everywhere and old food sitting around. It made me really regret eating here.\n\nAll in all, I will never visit Waffle House again. The establishment was dirty, the majority of the food was horrid, and the service was basically non-existent. Next time I want breakfast for dinner, IHOP will be getting my money.",

After an extremely long wait to be seated as usual, your told 15minutes that could easily turn into an hour and that's just the appetizer. My girlfriend and I are finally  seated, and I notice the waitress is giving my girlfriend plenty of eye contact as we place our order and giving me very little to none  like I was  a freakin ghost very unprofessional and I'm thinking\" what's up with that\" this is the first course. Right now already not feeling this place. Anyway, I ordered the jerk wings with the waffles. HORRIBLE ass salty caked on jerk like paste they use for the wings the waffles were good but those wings could've found more of a home in the trash. That was the icing on the cake for me. Had to even ask for more napkins from the waitress as she proceeded to look as she was rationing them out. They give you one silly paper napkin and I guess that supposed to hold you. At the end of our luxurious meal I told the waitress the wings are way too salty, she looked disappointed as if she personally made them. She asked if I wanted something else \"right know I'm really disgusted \" I said no just bring the check. My girlfriend said she would take them and maybe scrape some of the brine off they should be okay.What ever.... The waitress still looking like she was very disappointed. Oh well.... I see why Gordon Ramsey stays so angry at some of these restaurants. Because they really don't know what they are doing.If people are so hyped about this place I want to know what they are ordering please post. Maybe the cook didn't feel like cooking today. Or I should've ordered water and lemon as the main course.",

We sat down in a very packed Tony Romas on a Saturday afternoon and we waited and waited for a server to come by. The place was really busy so we sort of understood, but it got to the point where we almost got up and left.\n\nFinally, a very angry server stomped up and asked what we wanted to drink. No hello, no sorry, no eye contact. It was super uncomfortable. She pretty much forced us to make a decision on the spot about what we wanted to eat and after we ordered, she avoided us like the plague.\n\nShe had one large table half filled with kids and one of them asked for another milkshake. She was holding a bunch of dirty dishes and as he asked for the refill, she stormed over to the drink area right behind our table and THREW the dishes into the sink. It was so loud and it startled me. I can't imagine how the kids felt. How embarrassing.\n\nAfter a mediocre meal and continued empty glasses we asked for the cheque- and the manager. All of a sudden, she was nice and said she would be happy to grab the manager for us.\n\nAnother server came up to the table and said that the manager was just on a phone call and she was a senior server and could talk to us. I was not buying it. I had seen the two servers chatting at some point during our horrible meal and assumed they were friends and she was now covering her friends butt.\n\nNevertheless, I told the problem to her in detail and she apologized. That was about it. No discount, no \"please come back\", no accountability.\n\nThe worst part about it was when we were walking to our car, we saw the manager standing outside with a group of servers smoking. \"On a phone call\"?\n\nRight.\n\nThis place definitely lost our business.",

    "text": "Very poor quality as a hotel restaurant.  \nWe eat at a hotel restaurant even its food is mediocre and everything is overpriced, because we expect to be treated really nicely by well trained staff.  Well, the experience at this hotel restaurant was very unique.  We (five of us) stayed at the Hotel Monaco to celebrate my birthday, and reserved Red Owl Tavern based on many good reviews.  When we arrived at the tavern, we were taken to a table for four.  We told the gentleman that we were a party of five and we had a reservation.  He told us that he would bring a chair.  So, one of us sat on a chair that was placed in an aisle.  We then saw the area in the back where a group of five or so just left.  So we asked if we could move there.  The waitress told us that those tables were reserved.  I told her that we too \"reserved\" a table for five not four, and it was my birthday.  She told me that she would \"see what she could do.\"  Soon, a lady came to our table and said, \"Those tables are reserved.\"  I told her that we had made a reservation for five.  She said, \"Sorry, this is only what we have\" and patted on my shoulder and left.  My husband was upset, but I said it was OK.  I decided not to let this ruin my birthday.  After that, however, few things went right. They brought pasta with cheese even though I asked the waitress no cheese due to my daughter's allergy.  So, my very hungry daughter had to wait another 20 minutes for her pasta with no cheese.  We had to ask why the bread, the side, and my father's dish were so late when other dishes were already at the table.  When the bread came after a long wait, it had butter on it despite the fact we told the waitress my daughter was allergic to dairy.  My 81 year old father's dish (Caesar salad with chicken) finally came after everyone finished their food which was more than an hour after we ordered all the food.  While all these things happening, we saw the area we had hoped to move in order to have more room which was \"reserved\" completely empty.  Toward the end of the meal, a couple of people were seated at one of the empty tables.  Our waitress was very apologetic.  She was never rude.  She took the pasta, Caesar salad, bread, off the bill, which was nice.  Would I like to dine at Red Owl Tavern again to deal with all the stress, especially for a special occasion like a birthday?  Absolutely not.  I hope the general manager of the Hotel Monaco (Mr. James Adamson) will make more effort to train people at the restaurant at the Hotel.",

    "text": "**want to clarify it wasn't the food that made him sick, he had the flu**\n\nI've been here many times and always had a pleasant experience. However,  I went here over the weekend with my boyfriend. while we were there he started feeling very bad (he ended up having the flu). He tried using the bathroom but it was locked. He had to basically run from the back to the front of the restaurant to make it out the front door. He got sick right outside. He was extremely embarrassed but did not have any other options. A woman who worked there proceeded to walk out and yell at him as if he did it on purpose. He was so mortified that he just left. After a text from him, I asked for the check and headed to checkout. This is where I headed to the register to find the entire staff laughing at his expense. when I let them know that I was with him the woman ringing me up said- \"well why didn't he try to go into the bathroom?\" I let her know that it wasnt' available. Another girl even implied that he did it on purpose. I was then asked by my server \"well I hope last night was fun, was it worth it?\" - I let the entire staff know that he was not in fact, hungover, but actually quite sick. Although it was embarrassing for the both of us, and inconvenient for the restaurant, they are in the hospitality industry and probably shouldn't have yelled at one of their customers for being sick. They also shouldn't have assumed that he was drunk/hungover. And speaking about him infront of everyone, not knowing that I was with him was extremely rude.\n\nI have always raved about this place. But i am so put off by their behavior over the weekend that I wont be returning and don't intend on ever telling anyone else to go here. while I do apologize to them for the unfortunate incident that happened at the restaurant, I do believe that their behavior was absolutely unacceptable.",

Partly through the meal, I suspected there was butter in it, and when I asked a different waiter, he confirmed that it had butter. They then offered to bring me something else, but the rest of my family had already finished their meals so I said no. Lastly, to add insult to injury, when I asked the waiter why they were charging me for my meal, given that I couldn't eat it, he said that since my son (who does not share my allergy) was taking it home with him, they had to charge for it. \n\nI have been dealing with this allergy for a number of years now, and while it has presented issues at restaurants, never has it been as egregious as this. I went to talk to the ma\u00eetre d', who apologized and removed the item from our bill. But the damage had been done and I am suffering the consequences.\n\nI had been wanting to try this presumably \"elite\" restaurant for many years, and I'm very sorry that I did. Apparently, the waiter thought I said cheese allergy, not dairy. The waiter himself was somewhat disturbing, in that he was sweating the entire time he was serving us, seemed to have laryngitis, and was coughing a bit.",

Just chopped chicken that was grilled or fried. The meat itself was dry and tasteless. You cannot get a worse specimen of the dish.\n\nService :\nTerrible - the restaurant was Empty and yet everything took way too long. It took about 10 minutes just to get our drinks - iced tea...\n\nThe staff appeared to be on drugs - dazed and clueless.\n\nThe check:\nArrived with 18% gratuity tacked on. Turns out that on one of the back pages of the menu - the desert menu there is a notice that parties 6 and above will be charged automatically. This statement must appear on every page of the menu... \n\nThe owner:\nThe real problem is that we were a party of 5... That did not prevent the despicable owner of the restaurant to instruct the server to apply the automatic tip.\n\nWhen confronted, instead of apologizing and offering to refund the tip, he showed us the door poetically telling us that customers are like birds, they come and go, makes no difference to him.\n\nSo, you decide if such a loathsome human being deserves your business. There are plenty of other Mediterranean restaurants in the area that serve better food, have much better service, and don't steal from their customers.",

I don't know where they were running to, since we didn't see our server almost the entire meal. The bread they bring for the table is rubbery (you could buy better at Acme!!) and served with the worst quality olive oil; they should be embarrassed, as an Italian restaurant. The pasta on the specials menu was tough, and the menu is WAAAY over-priced for the portions and quality they're serving. God help you if you order that $20 (!!) glass of Chardonnay...

Followed by, \" Can you cut into it to make sure it's right?\". It's rare. Still not mad. He said he will have them throw it back on .\n\nAttempt 3. Sheila comes by a moment later and asks where the steak is, I again alert her to the issue and she goes to check on it. Again not mad. Sheila has been dealing with this as best she can . The manager's behavior makes it clear why she is with the customers and he's in the back . Sheila comes back out and informs us that my steak will be on them because of the issue with the reorder . \n\n  Well now the manager brings out my steak again. It's the same steak I cut into before . He asks me to cut into it, and it's not evenly cooked . The half I previously cut is medium and the middle/rest is still bleeding and rare. At this point it's late. My gf is finished with her meal and I'm tired of trying.  While I still do not feel mad I inform the manager that it will suffice.  Then out of no where this guy says,\" I guess it doesn't matter I'm paying for it anyway.\".\n\n What hell? You have had 3 tries to cook a steak medium and failed!  Now you are going to give me attitude?  My gf and I looked at each other, I smiled and told her we're  never going back .",

Basically, they skipped my App order with another web order that was placed after mine AND the person entered the restaurant as I was waiting for my order. I would've been fine if the manager apologized for the oversight and stated that he would go ahead and make it (by now, 3 more people had come in and my ticket was still in the wall), but he did not. He accused me of getting \"feisty\" with him. I asked for my money back and he apologized to the person behind me (who's order they bumped in front of mine) for the wait while he processed my return. I believe an issue of poor training and managerial skills. The customer is what drives a business and not apologizing for oversights and using derogatory terms is not conducive the brand. I emailed corporate and they offered me a coupon for a free meal. Not satisfied.",

He only said \"you ready to order?\" After two of us ordered, one friend started placing her sushi order but was deciding between two rolls. The waiter literally ran off in the middle of her speaking and said \"be back! Let me get somebody else's drink. Every minute counts!\". We were baffled at this. In addition, for myself and another friend, our food was much spicier than we requested. He gave us an attitude & then sent somebody else over to the table to assist. He never once asked if we needed refills. \n\nNeedless to say, we won't be frequenting this establishment anytime in the near future.

I've had bad experiences recently going through the drive through here (rude staff, making me feel like I've inconvenienced them) but my most recent trip there trumped all of that. I took my little brother through the drive thru and as soon as I pulled up to the first window, the cashier was BLARING explicit-lyric rap music. I have never experienced something like this at any drive thru, let alone one in a nice community like Fishers. Anyway, she kept telling me that I ordered something that I did not, and I had to tell her several times that I just ordered the chicken nugget meal before she finally got it. I paid her and she gave me back the change. Once I pulled up to the window to get my food, a guy came up to the window and in a threatening way said \"you owe her a dollar\" like it was my fault that the cashier gave me incorrect change. I gave him the dollar and he took it and laughed and said \"he tryna play you.\" I will not return to this location until something changes. Not only is the service horrid, but I would not feel safe bringing my family inside the restaurant in fear that I would be threatened if the cashier gave me the wrong change.",

They don't employ enough people to handle a full house on a Friday night. As far as I can tell, there is no service at your table. As a result, you have to go to the bar to get your beers. This usually results in waiting anywhere from 5 to 10 minutes for someone to finally take you order. God forbid you can't belly right up to the bar because if you are even one level away, they won't see you. They obviously haven't been trained to look beyond the bar for patrons wanting a drink. \nTo make matters worse, the head brewer is usually there helping himself to the tap and serving his friends. Who the hell runs this place?\nThe beer was good enough. I especially liked the Mac Daddy Scottish Ale. It was clean and malty, just as a Scottish Ale should be. The Danny Boy Black was also good.

Very good for a quick lunch but not for a nice date night. Bill was brought to us even before we asked. The worst of it all was 30 mins after I got home a was feeling very ill and was running back and forth from the washroom all night. Literally water coming out of my butt. Not cool! I called to let them know and asked to talk to the manager. The employee told me there was no manager available but he insisted I can't handle spicy foods and that's why I was so sick. I told him I eat Sombal and sriracha like ppl eat ketchup and can handle spicy, I eat very spicy foods on a regular basis. He was very rude and made me feel bad about what happened. I just wanted to let him know what happened. Not cool Numchok Wilai. U just lost a 10 year long customer. I'm a hairstylist and recommend ur restaurant to all my clients today as I talked about my date night. I'll make sure to reject that.",

To say it was \"a la\" was an overstatement.  The steak was chewy and luke warm.    Everything was bland.  The best taste was the refried beans- out of a can I'm sure.  The staff were not friendly. When I told them it was my daughter's birthday, it was ignored - no smile,  no acknowledgments,  nothing.  I wasn't expecting anything free or singing but a smile and \"happy birthday\" would have been nice. The staff never introduced themselves,  left dirty dishes on the table. ... Overall it was the worst restaurant experience in my life.  I've been in more than a few countries and even when I had no idea what I was ordering,  I got better tasting food and service!   Both of my children and I have food poisoning as well.  Avoid this place.  Oh and the bill. ... $75. Complete garbage!  \nAs for the alcohol... my margarita was straight tequila (not usually a bad thing but not for 6.75 and in ice). It was a waste of my time and money.  Never again!",

We asked to sit a table over just for a little privacy and he said no he's sitting at that table .. Well okay then . When he asked us what we want to drink I order a coke and without another word he brings us Pepsi . I don't know if it's just me but there is a difference and if I knew they had Pepsi products I would have simply ordered something else . The food wasn't very good for the price . I can get a frozen burger at mcdonalds if that's what I was in the mood for. After the obvious mood change the owner walked us to out table and TOSSES a coupon for 15% off and walks away without a word . We were not checked up on throughout and I had an empty cup through most of my meal . Won't be returning .",

It's pretty hard to screw up a po' boy.

    "text": "Deplorable. This is how I would describe the customer service at the Gaylord Opryland Hotel and Convention Center. \n\nI will start upon arriving at the facility: The valet staff should probably wear smiles and act as if we as guests are not an inconvenience. After all, this is there job. Easily dismissed though as everyone can have a less than great day. It was also 1:00AM local time. \n\nUpon entering the hotel (I refuse to refer to it as a resort which I'll explain later) I was awestruck by the beauty of the lobby and the gardens at the opposite end. This is of course where the pleasurable experience stopped, abruptly. Upon check in we were rudely greeted by a gentleman telling me my room rate was incorrect and it would be $100 higher than my reservation. Despite it being late, I calmly asked why the discrepancy? He couldn't advise me of a straight answer and of course no management staff was available. I had asked for other facilities in the area to which I was informed they were all booked. I'm curious as to know how he knew such a thing! Reluctantly, I checked in and was immediately billed $100 more per night for 3 nights, 3 days worth of parking at $23/day and an $18/day resort fee. Surprise!! I didn't have a choice in the matter because they hit my card with all of it right then and there. I advised him I would be speaking with a manager the following morning. Surprise again! No manager was available all 3 days! \n\nI left the front desk to find our room. And it was the worst hunt I had ever been on in my life. It took 30 minutes to find the room and the little river that runs through the atrium smelled something horrible. After wandering through the jungle we emerged in the Delta Region. I think that is somewhere in South Africa, but I'm unsure. Onto the next adventure! We were told 1 room number but our keys said another. Since I was advised verbally, we chose that one. Keys didn't work. Tried the one on the card and voil\u00e0, the doors opened: to a horribly small room with 2 double beds which had a peculiar odor to it. Now for the luggage. We used the \"Consider it Done\" button on the phone (which by the way I believe it said Consider it Done OUR Way, but I could be mistaken). The bellhop brought the luggage 25 minutes later. I think he got lost too. It's now 2:00AM and time to hit the hay and see Nashville! \n\nAt 8:30AM someone is brutally banging on our door. By the nature of the banging I would have thought it to be the Feds! Apparently Housekeeping doesn't pay attention to the little guitar shaped \"Do Not Disturb\" card. I'm awake now...and I want coffee! The coffee maker doesn't work. The iron didn't work. Ok. There's a cafe somewhere amongst the foliage! I saw it marked on the map. They should probably include a legend on said map. $8 for an overpriced knockoff Starbucks, but ok, it's Nashville and a local tourist trap. \n\nI'm going to fast-forward a little as to not make this much longer. Despite the pools not being open when they say they are, the restaurants being more expensive than those in airports and with mediocre food at best, being kicked out of the pizza place they had inside 10 minutes before closing and our room had an amazing view of dumpsters with the glorious rolling landscape of a parking lot, it was a nice place! The only saving grace were the gardens themselves. But you can view them without having to pay for a room! \n\nNow for the really fun part: Contacting Marriott Customer Care about the horrible visit. (The hotel won't call you back otherwise.) Customer Care advised me they would forward my grievance to the hotel and I should expect a response in 3-5 business days. I forwarded everything I could think of including my original reservation, costs, incorrect information and of course the issues we had while staying there. \n\nI was eventually contacted by a Heather Gates who is the Assistant Front End Manager. She informed me she was sorry for the way we were treated but they would not do anything to rectify the bill. That's the way it was. I contacted Marriott Customer Care again and copied Heather on this email. I was then phoned by John Bennefield, the Front End Manager who informed me the exact same thing as Heather \"Sorry, but you're stuck with that bill.\" Furthermore he refused to give me the hotel manager's name, phone or email. Instead I was informed of his 15 years with the company and this was his 8th hotel! From working in a large company, when someone was transferred so frequently, we called it \"Passing the Trash\". It definitely wasn't due to pride of service. John was exceptionally rude and went on to belittle me for making such a huge deal and contacting customer care over a mere $300. To me, that's reasonably substantial. I was also informed directly that \"The Marriott considers this matter closed. It ends here and there's nothing more anyone will do.\" I had asked for the hotel managers number, name or email to which he told me \"you can find it online\".",

Last night, I stood on line for more than 20 minutes while the very young and very childish cashiers laughed and joked. Only one register was taking orders and the place was packed. After standing in line, I asked for the taco salad to be deconstructed so I could travel 3 hours with the food, and was told \"we can't do that\", which was a complete lie because I often pick up a meal to go. The customer service at this location is a joke. Great food, HORRIBLE SERVICE!",

The poboy was watery and ended up a flavorless mess. The pizza had a very thin, burned crust with too much cheap cheese and not enough real toppings.

Hasbrowns underneath were not cooked through, corn beef hash was hardly noticeable, biscuits and gravy were already solidified. They didn't even split them. Waitress asked \"sausage gravy?\" I said yes and found no sausage. Took a few bites, biscuits were dry. Pancakes were flat, tasteless, took a few bites of those as well. \n\nIf you want subpar industrial food or have no taste buds knock yourself out. Waitress sensed something was wrong, you just smile pay the check then yelp. Service was fine. Not recommended.",

One of the other waitress saw us and wanted to help seat us but that's when the rude waitress finally decided to help us. I currently saw the reviews here after the incident and if I would have known how bad their customer service is then we never would have ate here. \n\nAnyways, here ONLY for a milk shake.

I mean who doesn't love downtown southern food right? \n\nWe arrived right around 8pm and the restaurant was completely empty inside. It was a typical bar look inside with wooden booths and dim lights. We chose to sit outside since our was a nice night. We sat for about 20 minutes before somebody came to take our drink order. This should have been the indication of how slow service would be smh\n\nFor appetizers I ordered the shrimp and anchovy toast which the toast was burnt but the shrimp had a decent flavor. My friend ordered the country pate which was bland and not enough bread for the pate. My cousin ordered the biscuits and gravy which was the only good tasting thing. \n\nFor our entrees, I ordered the shrimp gumbo which was decent in flavor but needed more spices. My friend ordered the country fried chicken which was crispy but flavorless. My cousin ordered the braised beef short ribs which were very salty. We were far from impressed. \n\nFor dessert I took the recommendation of the server and ordered the whiskey brownie a la mode. The brownie was stale and so hard. I could have gotten a better brownie premade from the grocery store. \n\nSo the slow service with the mediocre food will cause us not to come back to this place. It's sad considering the food description had so much potential.",

    "text": "So I usually don't complain about anything business related because I'm a pretty mellow customer, but the service here actually prompted me to make a yelp account. I walked in and everyone was just sitting around doing nothing, they were on their phones and not even asking if we needed help. I literally had to bother one of the representatives to even look at me and when she finally did, she just gave me this look like, \"what the fuck does this little girl want?\" I'm a college student and my phone was stolen two nights ago so I went in to get a new phone. When I explained what happened and that my mom had already spoken to a verizon customer service rep who told us it would only cost 100, she laughed in my face and told me about all these extra charges that would make it closer to 200. Then when I had her explain the extra charges and information to my mom over the phone, she was completely rude and soooo disrespectful. Granted, my mom can be a bit abrasive at times but I was listening to the entire conversation and it did not warrant the response that Brenda (the sales rep) had. My mom was talking about how she had received different information than what Brenda had told her, this bitch actually held the phone away from her face IN FRONT OF ME. How dumb could you be?! My friend and I also overheard her talking about how irritating my mom was being when she went into the back room and even 30 feet away from us. She made several remarks and comments about my mom and the information she was \"trying to make her understand,\" and I was literally infuriated. Then once I had paid for my phone I was on my friends phone telling my mom the total and explaining the process etc and Brenda didnt even say have a nice day or goodbye once the sale was finished, she simply walked into the back room without anther word. I told one of the other very nice sales women that I was very disappointed and she seemed more sincere than the lady who had worked with me. I really wish I'd spoken to her instead. So basically, DO NOT GET BRENDA. Unless you feel like getting irritated and pissed off!",

Now to the food, yes they drop your toast when your order is put in and then it just sits in a pile for each server to grope over. They always burn the omlettes. The potatoes are undercooked and very greasy. Overall I can say the food is bland and lacks any real flavor. I have not had any other meal than breakfast .

I only went there because it was the closest to my route heading home. Cornbread = dry; cabbage = too peppery (let folks add their own pepper if they want it instead of the whole batch); yams = not enough flavor; baked chicken = tasted like 3-day old food. I paid a whopping $15.00!  It's hard to find good soul food in Lou that's affordable. I wouldn't mind paying that amount if I enjoyed it, but the meal was totally not worth what I paid.",

Ask the waiter for extra butter for the baked potato and by the time the butter came the potato was so cold, even the half melted butter wouldn't even melt the rest of the way. Took ten minutes to flag down our server for more soda since he never came back to check on us. Husband got the short ribs which was three pieces of meat. Ate one and started to eat the next but the remaining pieces were just fat and gristle. Complained to the server and was told the dinner would be taken off our bill but we had to pay for the sides. So how exactly did the \"sides\" almost cost as much as the dinner???? they took off $1.99. Bitched and they took off another 10%. Still NOT WORTH IT!!!. And all they said was sorry but it's our policy. Yes go ahead and laugh..... we are Seniors and eat in a lot of diners.  Never experienced anything like this before.",

Either I caught them on a really bad day, or Philadelphia is not the place to get sushi. \n\nThe 'Volcano Bowl' sounded promising - tuna tartare in a bowl of avocado. I've had tuna tartare at many different places, and this was by far the worst. Tartare is supposed to be chunky and juicy from the flavors of soy, lime juice, ginger, etc. What I received was reddish pink paste with zero flavor. \n\nThat was my appetizer, and I knew at that point I had made a mistake coming here instead of trying a burger at Village Whiskey. But I had 2 signature rolls coming so hoped the meal could be salvaged. Nope - the Paris roll was just OK at best, and my 2nd roll (forget the name) wrapped in cucumber was barely edible. \n\nNext time I'm in town I'll stick to cheesesteaks.",

When we arrived we were told that there would be a 30 minute wait. So we stood outside in the sun. After about 5 minutes, I asked one of the hostesses if there was a shorter wait time if we sat outside under the shaded patio. She promptly told me that the patio was closed due to a large party renting it out. Not 5 minutes later they seated a table of 3 at one of the 5 empty tables out there. Needless to say I was pretty upset about being blatantly lied to. After another 20 minutes of standing around we were finally seated. The building is visually appealing inside however it was so loud we couldn't even hear each other. My girlfriend ordered the A.M. Chile Relleno, and I ordered the tri tip sliders. We also ordered a french toast to split. The french toast was delicious, the tri tip sliders had no salt what so ever. And my girlfriends dish was absolutely cold. She ended up sending it back. They prepared a new one for her which also contained all but one morsel of salt. They did however take half off her dish for their incompetence. All in all Prep and Pastry is visited by people who want to be more hip than enjoy good food.",

I had heard about this place from the daily show during their visit to the DNC 2016 and I had never heard of water ice before and this was on my must do list when visiting Philly. So after walking here all the way from Pat and Genos I was really disappointed to find it close with no indication why.  Turns out most water ice places are just closed in the winter unless it's inside a mall. But still 1* for no warning ahead of time. I'm not a local, I'm a tourist I shouldn't be just expected to know these things. Their website even said we're open for the season.",

Upon entering, it looked to be a restaurant styled after St. Louis Bread Co. and I was eager to see how it compared.\n\nThe answer is not well.\n\nI got cheddar potato soup in a bread bowl. The soup tasted like a watered down version of Campbell's--just chunks of potato, celery, and carrots in a cream broth. The breadbowl tasted stale, like it had been taken out of a fridge and reheated in the microwave. I finished the soup because I was hungry but just left the bowl to sit there.\n\nCharlie got a caesar salad, which was just some lettuce with cheese and croutons sprinkled on top. The lettuce was slimy and the croutons were soggy by the time they were brought to the table.\n\nThe service was friendly and the prices weren't expensive, but the food was absolutely abysmal. Don't waste your money--stick with Bread Co.",

    "text": "As if I did not learn my lesson the first time, I went with my friends tonight. We had 8 people and ordered 80~90 dollars of food. Everything was still horrible and the microphones failed again! The bill they gave us had no prices next to the dishes. The only price we saw on the bill was a $180 smack in the middle. They said it was $150 minimum charge and they tacked on 20% tips to it when they did not deserve one penny. They could have told us the minimum charge at the beginning and tell us we should order more to reach $150, but they decided not to. They didn't say anything, they didn't allow us to get anything else too. They made us pay TWICE the amount we should have paid. They were so rude after we paid the bill. They literally rushed us right out of the room by shutting off the karaoke machine and pushing the chairs in. They promised us the room from 4:30 til 7:30, but kicked us out at 7:00 after we paid. The waitress who said 7:30 at the beginning was arguing with us when we asked her about it. She kept saying she knows what she said and that she said 7:00, but every single one of us knew she said 7:30 at the beginning. That was the end of the night.... Getting kicked out of a restaurant after getting charge twice the amount we ordered and arguing with the waitress for a half an hour of karaoke.",

I live just under 3 miles away from this place.  One night I ordered 2 large pizzas for my family and they didn't show up.  After an hour and fifteen minutes I called to ask if their driver had left and the girl's response was \" I am glad you called, we wrote your phone number down wrong so we couldn't get a hold of you to tell you we are not going to deliver your food.  We don't deliver that far.\"  I asked her why they took my order in the first place and why they didn't just deliver the pizzas regardless and she responded by telling me it wasn't their mistake.  (Please keep in mind...I LIVE 7 MINUTES AWAY.)  I voiced my concern to the manager, informing him that my children are now very hungry because he refused to deliver to my house that is under 3 miles away and he told me that he would call me when they were less busy.

I loved the tempura style batter, but the calamari was VERY tough and chewy.  We paid for it anyway since we had eaten more than just a bite.  The sizzling rice soup and the house (combo) fried rice were both too salty to eat - it tasted like they dumped the whole shaker in.  My entree was the Mongolian beef, and the beef was so soft and without texture I could barely chew it.  Disgusting.

I ordered a breakfast sandwich, which we had to wait for because the kitchen gave away the first one and tried to give the second one away until our waitress caught it. \n\nMy sandwich was okay, but I did notice the bread had mold on it which we quietly brought to our server's attention. She was very apologetic and brought it to the kitchen. She then came back out and explained the chef said it was from cutting spinach for the Eggs Florentine we had ordered. The spot was no where near where the bread had been sliced, and the color was more blue than green. It took a brief discussion with our server to have the sandwich removed from the check. So they're either cross contaminating the knives they're using or they're trying to serve their customers mold. We also never received the grits we ordered which they removed with no issue. \n\nJessica the waitress was very apologetic the whole time, and very sweet. The kitchen staff should be ashamed.",

    "text": "So I was really excited to try this place, and before I start this review let me acknowledge that yes, I do realize that we chose to try this place out for the 1st tim on  Cinco de Mayo, and I probably could expect slower than usual service at a Mexican restaurant, but I also might counter that with it being Cinco de Mayo, that a popular Mexican restaurant should know enough to have proper staffing. And let me also point out, that of all of the many Mexican restaurants in the Fountain Square area, they were by far the least crowded that night. \n\nOkay so with that out-of-the-way, my wife and I walked in, walked through the front area, through the middle bar, to the back outdoor tiki bar area. And while it was crowded, as I would've expected it would be, there was no standing room only, or people waiting for tables, in fact we found an empty table almost immediately.  We were encouraged, but we probably should have listened to the couple next to us who told us they sure hope we weren't planning on eating there, because they had been there for an hour and were still waiting on their food.  We were approached almost immedietly by a server who took our drink orders.  That had to be a good sign, right!  Well, our drinks took about 20 mins..ok so it's Cinco de Mayo, no big deal.  We figured we had better get our food order in.  Pretty simple order, chips and questo, and two tacos each.  Nothing special.  After about 45 mins and no sign of even our chips, I walked up to bar in front area and ordered chips and queso and 2 more drinks.  He got that all for me in about 5 mins.  I asked him if I could order a couple of tacos and he told me the kitchen was closed.  I told him we placed our order about 45 mins ago and he assured me we would get our food and it was only  closed for new orders.  Took our drinks and chips and queso back outside to tiki bar and relaxed for a while.  \n\nAnother 45 mins later and still no food.  We grabbed our waitress and she said she would check.  She came back about 30 mins later and informed us that our order was the last one the kitchen had accepted but they dropped our ticket on the floor and never made our tacos and were now out of everything.  Two hours and no food.  We asked to speak to manager but he/she was not available.  To cap it all off she still charged us for the two drinks we had ordered almost 2 hours ago.  I see that this place is highly reviewed by most for the food, but I doubt we will go back, and if they dont fix their service and management issues, I doubt this place will be around for very long!",

    "text": "I have debated posting this review since Mother's Day ( month ago). I want to be fair, but gnawing at my gut is the overall poor food experience I had there. \n\nOf course I wanted something special for my mother on this day, so I gathered my siblings and their families and selected 3 places to attempt to get reservations. One was at the William Penn Inn, the other Route 6. I scoured the reviews and menus and decided Square 1682 was the best option. \n\nSquare was super accommodating  with my large party of 12 and the customer service was outstanding. I canceled the reservation with the two other places and banked on Square delivering a great day. That was a mistake. \n\nPositive: The manager, staff, hostess, waitresses were super sweet. \n\nThe mimosas were the best think i consumed that dining experience\n\nTwo  items were comped\n \nCon's:\nTwo of our orders were mixed up ( another waitress took the ticket), so 10 of us ate while two of us watched. The late food arrived about 15 mins later. \n\nThe prime rib sandwich was skimpy, grossly over cooked, and barely edible. I have had a LOT of prime rib in my life, this was thin and crunchy. It was served with a tiny bit of sauce on a firm fancy roll. My mother ordered the same and the disappointment on her face was awful. The others at the table had a variety of underwhelming dishes. No one was satisfied, but everyone was polite. I was crushed. \n\nThere were a total of 5 mothers in that bunch and there was absolutely nothing special about it.  It was a nice room, the staff was nice, but it was one of the WORST dining experiences I have had in Philly.\n\nI REALLY regret booking this place. We spent hundreds of dollars and everyone left a little quiet and disappointed. As a matter of fact my mother later confided she was STARVING after we left. \n\nI understand holiday restaurant service is maddening, but IMO this place was not properly staffed, nor prepared to handle providing good food on a special day. I would NEVER recommend someone come to this establishment. I wish I had chose one of the other places. \n\nNext year I'm #teamSomewhereElse! I don't mind paying the money, if I leave with a smile on my face. \n\nNo smiley face here....",

We tried the bowls at the Juice Merchant but thought they were just okay, so we were excited when Boostin' Bowls opened up in Manayunk.  We tried both the Boostin' and the PB&J bowls.  The acai they use is a puree that comes from a box and blended with ice, so after a few minutes of eating, the entire bowl becomes a bland, watery mess with very little taste (or the benefits!) of actual acai.  Even though it cost us over $25, we ended up throwing half of it away and went somewhere else for breakfast.  Not sure where they learned to make acai bowls, but I don't think you're supposed to blend ice with the acai.  We make far better bowls at home with the frozen acai packs you can get from Whole Foods.  So if you want a real acai bowl, you'll need to go to the Juice Shack in OCMD or our house--not here.",

Low quality is what comes to mind. Unfortunately, they were so dead on the Saturday we went for lunch that all of the crystal shrimp was disgusting and soggy like cake batter... No mussels or green tea ice cream were offered. I explained how crappy the food was to the sushi chef who made it and all he had to share was laughing. So I would say if you wanted really funny bad sushi spend your 18$ and then hit Walmart for new chonies.... Avoid, there are other choices near by that take it a bit more serious.",

Now don't get me wrong I have  been to chickie and petes on several occasions and it was a great experience BUT last night made me feel like I was on a bad episode of BAR RESCUE.\n\n1.  when we walked in (party of 3) the women at the hostess booth were so busy in their own conversation to even acknowledge that someone walked in. we waited for about 1 minute before even being acknowledge (STRIKE ONE)\n\n2.  after being seated the waitress came right over and asked us what were we drinking.  didn't give us a minute to even look at the menu.  after ordering the drinks (which came out very fast) we order our appetizers.  the appetizers came out very fast which was great.  but we finished the appetizers and waited a good 10 minutes before the waitress came over and took our ENTREE order (STRIKE TWO)\n\n3.  Entrees come out  (which were pretty good) and we finished them.  the waitress never not once came over and asked us how are we, did we need anything, she basically never came to check on us.  when she finally came over we asked for boxes  because we couldn't eat the rest of the food.  she brought us the boxes and left.  for another 15 minutes before we flagged her down and asked her for the check.  (which she should of brought when she gave us the boxes).  (STRIKE THREE)\n\n**oh did I mention that it wasn't crowded?  so there was no need for the POOR customer service.\n\n\nbottom line -- the FOOD here is GREAT,  but the customer service SUCKS ASS BIG TIME.  The waitress we had was very lazy, unprofessional, and act like she was intimidated by us.  My company does a lot of business with sports bars in Philadelphia and because of last night I will have them reconsider their relationship with CHICKIE and PETES.\n\nI will take GREAT customer service with mediocre food ANY DAY -- over POOR customer service and GREAT food..",

    "text": "I know, what should I expect from a rundown Burger King at 8th & Market? But today's experience was really beyond pathetic. \n\nI waited for 20 minutes this morning for my simple order of 2 breakfast sandwiches and hash browns. The workers showed no interest at all in helping customers or making food. The cashier took an order, then slouched off to do something in the back, no apologies. The line extended to the door. \n\nI could see in the kitchen they were slowly cooking a couple items, and frying a small basket of hash browns. With the number of people in line they should have had a double order of everything on the grill and been hustling to get it all done. \n\nIt took 10 minutes just to get to the cashier and place my order. Then I stood against a wall and waited another 10. I watched 6 people who were behind me in line get their food first. When I finally asked if they'd skipped me they said \"no your order is almost ready.\" But there was no reason mine should have taken longer. They were just apathetic, half asleep and verging on mean with their annoyance at customers who didn't come when their number was called. \n\nAfter all that, the sandwiches were sloppily put together, egg hanging out the sides, and wrapped with the inside of the wrapper on the outside. \n\nSo if by posting this I can get even ONE person to avoid this place, I will feel I've done my job.",

I didn't want it getting cold. They said no I have to wait in line. WHAT!!!!! So my bagels could be cold. The wait in line was another 20 min almost. So my bagels sat for almost an hour. So I decided I was going to reorder them then when I got to the front of the line. They wouldn't let me. So now I have hour long made food. Gross and Luke warm. On top of that I ordered a milk to go it's frozen I can't even drink it. Absolutely ridiculous. Reporting this company as well because the staff is absolutely rude. All college kids. Have no respect.

I called Kelp and the person who answered the phone at 8:31pm said that she would not take my delivery order because it was after 8:30. Tonight was our final attempt at enjoying sushi delivery. I placed my order and paid online at 7:40pm. At 9:20 I called Kelp, the person who answered said they never put my order in. She said they use a 3rd party vendor and in order to process a refund she would need to call the owner. She wasn't apologetic and said they got a ton of orders and only have a few drivers.",

    "text": "For all I'm about to say, I feel I have to mention again that this is an honest review and I'm not even embellishing much on my experience here. I'll give them two stars. \n\nOne extra star because they did something I can appreciate out here in the middle of the USA. They didn't try to charge me $8 for a simple Vietnamese sandwich. You guys HAVE to understand that these bAnh mi sandwiches are a DOLLAR in Asia!!! They are $2-3 dollars in California but for some dang reason they are $5-8 in the heart of the USA. I ate it up gratefully and happily. It wasn't as good as the last bAnh mi I had which was in SE Asia (mystery meat and questionable cleanliness standards but soooo dang tasty and I felt fine after eating it), but it hit my craving spot like a hammer.\n\nAlong with a bAnh mi was an order of goi cuon (spring rolls). The rolls were pretty small and the dipping sauce was crap. I'm sorry for not sugar coating, but it was absolutely crap. Like I tasted it and was like, \"dude wtf is this?!?!\" It was bland, and the strangest color I've ever seen in a goi cuon dipping sauce. It was like a light grayish brown with a less than creamy little bit more watery than creamy diarrhea texture. It was a very stupid dipping sauce. If people in Indiana say, \"I hate Vietnamese food.\" I would first blame this restaurant as the prime culprit. I would rebut with, \"did you, by chance, eat at Saigon Restaurant?\" If this was someone's sole venture into Vietnamese food, I plead for them to try somewhere better and give it another try.\n\nThe next dish up... hu tieu bo kho. Beef stew with noodles. The beef was nice and tender and there were some great bits of tendon and carrot, but seriously... no real bo kho looks like what we were served. The broth should be a rich dark brown with a bit of orange oil highlighting the surface. This just looked like very dirty Pho broth. This is not the beef stew you serve to dip bread in. I feel like I was being served counterfeit Vietnamese food. I think that's why I'm not happy writing this review. \n\nFortunately there seems to be some competition in Indianapolis for viet restaurants though. I hope that puts some fire in the competition and makes for better quality authentic Viet grub. If restaurants like this one is killing the first impression to the Indiana market, there may be no coming back!\n\nIt gets worse. The viet iced coffee tasted like soap. I cannot explain it. Did they not rinse the glasses throughly? Perhaps it was the viet coffee press that still had dish soap in it? What happened there? It was nasty.\n\nIt gets worse. I've been around. I've lived in a single bedroom apartment with a family of six with a billion cockroaches as a child. I've lived in cheap motel rooms with roaches and the smell of bug spray in the sheets. I've eaten whole meals in other countries with cockroaches crawling up the wall. But for some reason this kinda irked me... I saw our waiter at the counter visually tracking a bug on the counter. Then swat at it with his hand. Then move things around a bit and try to kill it again. In my mind I imagined a cockroach was his victim. I watched and watched... but did not notice any washing of hands after that hunting trip. Why were there no towels drying off his hands within the next five minutes? Why did his hands not seem moist at any time between this occurring and him serving our food? Like I said, I'm used to bugs, I don't like them and they still gross me out, but I can convince myself some stuff is okay... but why not wash your hands bro? Take some of that extra soap that was in my coffee and give it a go... I'd really appreciate it a lot. I'm sure the health department would as would the customers! It wouldn't take much more time out of your day.\n\nI came to Indianapolis in search of good Asian food that would solve a series of cravings. I'll keep looking. Louisville has some great solutions. Perhaps Ohio is where I'll look next...\n\nI'm thinking of taking away that extra star... yeah...",

Saw that a regular frozen margarita was $6.75 and a flavored one was $8.50. Confirmed here on their website: http://neworleans.superiorgrill.com/drink-menu.html\n\nWhen I asked the bartender what flavors of frozen margaritas they had, he rattled off a list: watermelon, peach, blackberry, and some others. I said I would like a blackberry frozen margarita.\n\nThe bartender served me a regular frozen margarita with a small glass of blackberry syrup on the side. \"That'll be $11.75,\" he said. I said \"I thought flavored margaritas were $8.50?\" He said \"That's only for strawberry.\" \n\nI said, \"Why are you giving it to me like this? It's not mixed.\" He replied \"So you can see what you are paying for.\"\n\nI proceeded to pour the blackberry syrup into my tall margarita cup. It pooled on top of the drink and would not thoroughly blend with the rest of the drink. I asked the bartender if I could have a cup so I could mix the drink by pouring it back and forth between cups. Instead of offering to mix the drink himself, or providing me a spoon instead of a flimsy straw to mix my drink, he handed me a styrofoam cup.\n\nThere were two male customers on either side of me, they were audibly sympathizing with me and making comments about having to mix my own drink.\n\nIn retrospect, I should have asked to see the menu so I could point out that it said Flavored Margaritas were $8.50, and didn't say \"Strawberry only.\" But at a crowded bar with people waiting behind me to be served, I didn't want to cause a scene.\n\nInstead, I will vote with my feet and my wallet, and avoid Superior Grill and their lazy, apathetic, misinformed bartenders.",

    "text": "I'll start by saying that mellow mushroom is my favorite pizza in the world, but the Brandon location is consistently inconsistent. I travel for a living and have eaten at Mellow Mushroom all over the country, the Brandon location has a different taste and look than anywhere else. It is always very sparse with the toppings, compared with all the other locations.  When you have four different toppings on a pizza and can take 2 to 3 bites without biting into any ingredient, then something is wrong! The jerk chicken barely has any spice on it,  to the point where you can't even taste the spice. The last three times I have gone they have completely gotten the order wrong. The last time was for my birthday and we live an hour away. When they got it wrong the waitress very reluctantly took it back and have them fix another one. It's like she made me feel guilty for them messing it up. Then I went today on the way home, and they didn't put the sun-dried tomato on it. The clock actually argued with me that it was on there when I told him to pointed out, he said it was under the cheese. So I then proceeded to peel all the cheese back and it was not there. He again gave me attitude for putting on something that I had already paid for. I am convinced that the owner of this location purposely scrimps on the ingredients to save money. On top of that customer service is terrible to the point where I don't even feel like ever coming back. And that says a lot for my favorite pizza.",

    "text": "Boy, how things have changed in a year since my first very positive review from last July.  The movie theater next door was condemned and Bailey's has followed suit.  The food is of poor quality and overpriced.  I ordered a specialty salad and it took 45 minutes and was missing the avocado, egg, and cheese when it finally arrived; items which they don't carry anymore but haven't updated the menu or told the waitresses about.  The chocolate cake with ice cream arrived after 45 minutes with the ice cream fully melted.  All still charged full premium price for.  The restaurant also sponsors Superbowl parties for which we reserved a $100 table, drink, and appetizer package which was not worth the price; a St. Patrick's Day party, and Cinco De Mayo celebration as well as many others at which you are encoured to drink, drink, and drink the specials.  However when you try to be responsible and need to get a taxi/cab home the Management and workers have said on more than one occassion that \"it's not their problem and taxis won't come out to their location\".  That's totally irresponsible.  Used to be a good place but now I'm ASHAMED to invite any friends there or take my wife out for dinner and drinks.  I'll spend my $100 a week elsewere.  The nearby Logan's Roadhouse O'Charleys, and Outback Steakhouse are much better choices and values and you won't have Coal Miner's lung after one night of the poor ventilation.",

Even after paying this astronomical amount was I was still charged $8 for a microwaved breakfast sandwich and $16 for a small tube of neosporin. Lets not even talk about the restaurant prices. Lunch at the cafe for two- just ordering 3 small tapas plates (1 California roll was $12!!!!) and 2 alcoholic beverage each was a whopping $70 (not including tip). The resort was INCREDIBLY difficult to navigate and it took me and my coworkers over 20 min to find our rooms. There were limited breakfast options and the grab and go options had massive lines due to being understaffed. Even the shuttle to the airport was not complimentary. Taxis to downtown Nashville were $30 each way. Rooms were clean but needed to be checked better. I had no room service menu, the iron was cheap and leaked water right out of the holes (they brought me a brand new one and it did the same thing)- ruined a dress of mine. Lamp with appliance plugs was broken. I could hear screaming kids up to 11pm at night. I didn't even know how to get to the atrium outside my room. I felt trapped in a biosphere and would never return willingly to this place again. Overall, it completely overpriced and not a relaxing stay at all. For a \"world class resort\" here in the United States it pretty shameful. I've had a completely better stay at resorts in other countries that are 1/2 the price, go there instead!!!!!",

    "text": "I just had the worst experience I've ever had at a restaurant here. Avoid it like the plague. \n\nWe didn't even get to ordering the food before we left in intimidation.\n\nSo, we had ordered coffee, someone ordered decaf, but then changed her mind to decaf. Our waitress brought both decaf and regular. When we pointed out the confusion, in a very understanding way (really making sure that she knew that we totally see how the confusion had occurred). This lady got angry! Left me speaking half way through and gave me her back, she came back with another thing of regular coffee, and started to bang our silverware on the table with a face of complete discontent. \n\nShe didn't provide a straw for a tea, and there was another waitress near by. Not wanting to upset our waitress even more my brother's fiancee asked this other waitress for a straw. She looked at her also with an attitude, and she said: both of my hands are full, can't you see! \n\nFull disclosure: both of these waitresses were African American and my family is hispanic. I don't know if there's some sort of racial issue in New Orleans between these two races, but it just seemed that there was a lot of aggression for things that are pretty normal at a restaurant. \n\nWe said we wanted to leave and asked for the check and the manager. The manager came, and asked us what the situation was. Our waitress had these threatening eyes on us the entire time, and the manager asked her to step aside, at which point the waitress started raising her voice. We said to the manager: \"this attitude is precisely why we want to pay and leave now and handed her $20dlls without looking at the bill (but we had asked for 2 coffees, 1 tea, water, and 2 diet cokes, a lot less than $20). I was expecting for an apology and to let us go without pay since we had barely touched our drinks. However, she took our $20dlls. and left the table. All the while three people with long hair peaked from the kitchen staring us also in a very threatening way. It was actually very scary. When the manager picked up our $20dlls we didn't wait for the change and left the table. We were actually worried for a little bit about being followed by the guys staring at us from the kitchen, but it was all fine. We're just never going back. \n\nIt is a real shame, because I really like Ihop.",

Based off her body language, and tone she definitely didn't want too. To cap it off though when we finish eating. We waited not five but ten minutes to get our checks.

They were informative about sending the fortune cookie to my husband's work at decent time to prevent the chocolate cover fortune cookie from melting. I was a bit disappointed because I did pay for overnight shipping and had to wait at least 3 days to my husband to receive it. I was willing to let that go until my husband brought it home from work at the cookie was not only broken but it cookie itself was burnt! I understand the shipping problem since it was to be delivered to California and the fact that it can break while being shipped but for the cookie to be burnt and inedible ?! Of all things it would of been nice for husband to at least enjoy eating the fortune cookie.",

    "text": "After a long day last Sunday trudging through the woods to clean and clear trail myself and two other friends decided to go out for dinner.  We stopped at the Pic-A-Lilli on Rt. 206 and it was packed shoulder to shoulder.  So we decided to go to La Campagnola instead, just before five o'clock.  It was really kind of empty at that time.  I read on the bill board outside that they offer an early bird special until 5:30.  We sat at the bar and the tall skinny young bartender, that plays college volleyball and looks like Clarke Kent (I don't know his name) hands us menu's.  I had to ask for the Early Bird Menu, it wasn't automatic.  I ordered the Fettuccine Campagnola which was a white cream sauce with peas and small cubes of prosciutto, it also came with, \"soup, salad and my choice of two desserts.\"  I ordered the seafood bisque for my soup and wanted a house salad and a cannoli for my dessert.  The bartender says, \"it is soup OR salad\" and i explained that there was a comma in between the words 'soup, salad' and not and 'OR'!  I told him i wanted soup AND salad.  Remember I walked through the woods so at that point in the day I was starving!  I ordered a beer while i was waiting and the soup came out.  It was just ok...nothing too great, no real hunks of seafood.  Then I expected for my salad to come out and instead the pasta dish comes out....so I ask, \"where is my salad?\" and the bartender responds AGAIN, \"it is soup OR salad\" as if i am mentally disabled.  I said, \"yes, i know, but i wanted salad too.\"  He said, \"Oh, ok.  I can go get that right now.\" as my pasta dish was sitting there getting cold.  I told him forget about it at this point my entree is here already.  Apparently it was the end of his shift and he was more concerned about cashing his drawer out than waiting on us.  Then he was a douche on top of that explaining that it was 'OR' even though the friggin menu had a comma which indicates AND!!  All the while making me out to be some kind of retard.  Anyway, having a father that is an Executive Chef from Italy and growing up in the restaurant business, I know that THE CUSTOMER IS ALWAYS RIGHT!  I won't be going to that dump anymore!  Eff that place...they should hire people that aren't kids and people that know how to type a specials menu!",

She said she was seated promptly and courteously, but that's where the service ended. \n\nIn the 40 minutes that she waited at our table not one person acknowledged her, no one even filled the water glasses, which were empty when I arrived. The table was only about 15 feet from the bar, where the wait staff was constantly coming and going with food and drink orders. It is impossible that no one noticed her.\n\nA few moments after I arrived, our water glasses were filled, bread was set out and we were told our waitress would be with us in a moment. After hearing my girlfriend's story, we decided to give them 10 minutes from when I sat down and in that 10 minutes no one else acknowledged us, or took a drink order.\n\nSo, after my girlfriend had waited 50 minutes without so much as a drink order taken, we left and went down the street to The Wolf where we had a great experience at a fraction of what I would have paid, and they only had two waitresses working.\n\nI cannot comment on the food, but the other reviews of the noise levels are accurate. It is very loud, and they seem to amplify the sounds of screaming children. Another issue I had is that the wait staff had no uniforms or name tags or anything to indicate they worked there, it was very chaotic. \n\nI understand this location is new, but I'm in no rush to return and give them a second chance.",

    "text": "This is a really bad establishment overall. We found the restaurant's decor impressive however this restaurant demonstrates really bad waiter service and probably acts of greed. It's a disgrace that this restaurant is serving as a living representation of Taiwanese culture.\n\nFirst of all, the food is decent enough considering that it is away from the Bay Area, which thusly does not introduces competitive Taiwanese restaurants. If this restaurant were in the Bay Area, the restaurant would be sure to go out of business. At the restaurant, we ordered Stinky Tofu and it was unbelievable when we were given only 8 pieces for 5 dollars. That equals to about roughly 60 cents per piece. That is ridiculous considering the dedication and size of these pieces. Besides from that, we decided that the food is reasonable enough although it was smaller portioned compared to the Bay Area Taiwanese restaurants. \n\nThe waiter service as mentioned previously is horrible. The waiters offered no expression of gratitude for keeping them in employment. In addition, as we left, the waiter offered no thanks and greedily halted his task on hand and searched visually our table for our tips. This is ridiculous. I understand that the all people want money. Or else why work? The problem is that he doesn't mask his temptations and greed of money and plainly expresses it.\n\nThe decor in the restaurant is one good aspect of the restaurant. I found the restaurant rather comfortable and the television was conveniently angled so then the customers do not need to turn their necks uncomfortably. I loved the painting of Taipei 101 on the wall as well. The kitchen was opened to us and from what I see, the kitchen looks pretty clean.\n\nThe thing that makes me angry at this establishment is the inclination of the waiters to whites opposed to non-whites. The waiter offered better services to our neighboring table of whites however, offered less then decent services to us non-whites. We found this consistent throughout the restaurant. Now, I honestly don't care what the reason of discrimination may be but this is beyond acceptable.",

    "text": "My friends and I were visiting Nola for the first time and decided to yelp a restaurant close by to our hotel. This place had pretty good ratings so we decided to give it a try. We were on a laid back vacation, we were all dressed quite casual. This may or may not have been the reasoning behind our effortless service. We could tell we were being judged as a group of young kids pretending to be grown ups. Where was the southern hospitality? Not found here, at our table at least. \n\nI ordered the shrimp and grits, which was said to be a favorite, and I was extremely disappointed. It was SO salty, I was only able to take a few bites and had to stop eating. I really regret not sending it back but the service made me feel uncomfortable. So I basically paid $26 for a couple bites of sodium enhanced grits. Taste aside, the portion was also saddening. You get a little scoop of grits covered in too much sauce. While taking our orders, the waiter asked us if we wanted soup or salad. Where I'm from, this signifies that it comes with the order. But not here. So each of us ordered a side and got charged $5 for it without even meaning to. \n\nAlmost everyone else at my table had ordered a burger, which they seemed to enjoy very much. It came with fries which also seemed to have endured a heavy hand on the salt. Their large burgers with fries were much cheaper than my tiny plate of shrimp and grits. \n\nSo to round it all up, my personal experience consisted of bad service and unsatisfying food. The atmosphere was nice though. I'm sure the other costumers who dressed a little nicer and knew what to order had a better time than I did.",

Plus, manager lady had to be hostess, bartender, and food runner; if that doesn't tell you that the place is mismanaged then I don't know what does. The only kudos I can give is that the hot food I ordered from the kitchen came out in a timely fashion and steaming hot. Kudos to the people working behind the wall. Unfortunately, my family and I will never return here simply because the manager could care less that every, single non-hibachi table was miserable and waiting far too long for their food. She never apologized. She never took responsibility. She never offered anything until we complained and again all she could do was 10% off a $60 bill. Pathetic!",

Anyway, no chips or salsa brought out, house margarita was fruity and small, and overall non impressive bland/artsy flavor.  \n\nI ordered the Chili Rellenos,  which the server brought out and asked who was having the \"chili dinner\".  I've never had a fruity Chili Rellenos, but this one was filled with raisins and pine nuts with very little spice or sauces such as Chili Verde or Rojo.  \n\nMy opinion, being raised in New Mexico, and extensively traveling Mexico and Spain was that this was an artsy attempt to upsell Mexican cuisine.   \n\nI heard reactions to the enchilada meal as being very coconut heavy in flavor, and even a Taco Bell Reference.  \n\nIf you wanted more authentic Mexican food I'd direct you to the closest Applebee's, Chipotle, Taco Bell...and that's not Mexican food as well.",

    "text": "I believe this place offered authentic Mexican food.  With that said, there were a few red flags.  First of all, we had trouble ordering.  I do not speak a bit of Spanish, and our waitress, and all staff in proximity did not speak English.  This was awkward.  There was also an issue with a smartphone-based coupon, which was kind of the entire point of going there in the first place.  After a young girl who worked in the adjoining grocery store came over, she advised me that it was her manager's policy that all discount codes had to be physically printed out.  She laughed at me when I told her that it wasn't my problem that they have weird rules for discounts.  She quickly believed that she had stalemated me with 'It's not my problem, either.', and I was laughed at.  When I informed her that it wasn't funny, I was told that the discount would be applied.  \n\nHere comes the food.  It was good; it tasted good, it was priced-well, and the order was accurate.  I noticed 2 things - about 5 feet away from me, a waitress was very clearly picking her nose.  Also, she had a finger in her mouth for no less than 45 seconds.\n\nThe ambiance seemed like a practical joke.  Authentic music was supplied via tinny PA speakers that had a source supplied from a laptop playing Youtube videos.  The televisions were strangely lined with a thick layer of Saran wrap.\n\nAll-in-all, I'd avoid this place in the future.",

I ordered a shrimp platter, an order of mozzarella sticks, and a root beer, which came up to $16. Steep!\n\nMy mozzarella sticks tasted awful--wayyy too salty, first of all, and they were just frozen sticks out of a box. There were five of them, so I paid a dollar a stick for frozen crap that was too salty to even eat. I ate one and ended up tossing the rest.\n\nThe shrimp were likewise cooked out of a box of frozen junk, and somehow they had managed to overcook them so they were kind of hard. The shrimp inside were super-small and it was mostly breading. Five shrimp came with soggy, mediocre fries, some bread, a small side salad, and cole slaw. I ate like six fries and by that time I had given up on my meal, so I can't report on the slaw, salad, or bread.\nMy can of soda was not even very cold, so they managed to screw that one up, too.\n\nThis place charges way too much to be serving such crappy food.

We were both excited about coming here as we had been to the previous restaurant at this location and were very pleased.  We thought we would be WOWed after reading the menu.  What we found was a pleasant but inattentive server and bus boys that seemed to be clueless.  The food was mediocre at best.  I had the poached pear salad.  The flavor was very good on the pears but for $8.50 I wanted more than 4 thin slices.  it was supposed to have smoked Gouda.  I think there was 6 pieces that appeared to be box shredded.  I could not find the craisins or walnuts and the greens were starting to turn brown.  My husband had the wedge salad.  Again, over priced for the quality and amount.  I had, as an entree, the Jumbo Lump Crab Cakes.  They had no flavor.  The mashed potatoes had a lump of cheddar in the center and were overpowered by Old Bay seasoning.  My husband had the Seafood Pescatore which he said was OK.  I will say the desserts where beyond excellent.  We were told they were homemade so KUDOS to the baker.  We shared a Chocolate Mint Torte.  My mouth waters thinking about it.  The server, while she was pleasant, came over to take our order and then we did not see her again until she gave us our bill.  We asked for flatware as our food was served with no implements to eat it with.  Had we had the set ups at arrival we may have had a luke warm rather than cold meals.  When we asked for red wine glasses it too over 20 minutes for a bus boy to provide and when we asked for water you would have thought we had three heads each.  We will not be returning however, if the person who made the desserts opened a dessert eatery, we would frequent that establishment.",

    "text": "I used to do WingStop once a week. Now I frequent the other places in town which are superior only due to the fact that the cooks follow directions. Also about 1.5 years ago Wingstop shifted to some Frankenstein sized giant wings. The skin to meat ratio is completely off and the size is kind of disgusting tbh. But here is the real problem.... the staff is nice and perfectly decent but just dim. On repeated visits over the past year, I ask for well done wings, extremely well done. Really I just want the skin to be a little bit crispy. I even receive assurances at the register and told specifically they will be 23 minutes cook time. Then the fkn retards serve up my order less than 20 minutes later and insist they are well done. Soggy skins, chunks of fat that has not melted, etc. I even pointed this out and just received BS from the staff for the last time. Fk them. They didn't even offer to fix the order even though the staff had to clean the table and throw away a basket full of uneaten wings (8+3). Wingstop is disgusting now.... with their monstrous and undercooked wings.",

As I was walking out this guy started laughing and saying can you believe that lady? She thought we were open and laughed. So I tried to get back in and the door was locked so I told the guy from the open window that I heard what he said and i thought it was rude! His reply was I couldn't believe you thought we were open, the chairs were on the table and the door was locked. I replied by saying that I walked right in and I had never been here before, there were customers eating also. Anyway he follows me out and says what is your problem. He never apologized or anything. I will never try to eat here again and let everyone know how rude they are!! There are many nice places to eat on the pier! So whatever you do don't eat there!!!",

This resulted in not only a long wait to order and be served your food at their lil bar stools, but also the food was cold. I had the jambalaya, which tasted like it was straight out of a Zatarran's box, which is fine if you weren't paying $10 for it. My mom had the grilled shrimp poboy. Much to her dismay the shrimp was not grilled and it was not large shrimp, but rather small baby shrimp. We never got a refill on our diet coke nor were we given water. Whatever you do, don't waste your money here at this tourist trap. There are plenty of other eateries to experience local fare",

It looked good because it had an upstairs and an outside seating that overlooked the Mississippi River. That was the pros. Now the cons. When the hostess seated us she cleared the table but never came back to wipe it. There were no place settings and no dishes. Even though they were not busy everything took forever. When the crab bisque came out it was lukewarm as was the char broiled oysters. The oysters were seasoned with  way to much salt. We ordered bruschetta six oysters 2 cups of bisque and a beer. The bill was $77. Ouch. Too many great restaurants with great service and great food for far less money. Will not be back.",

That was, until I ate there. \n\nI've given this location lots of tries. Lots. And it always falls flat. My last experience is a pretty good snap shot of how it goes. We sit and wait for a server. And wait. Oh, and then wait. Once he or she arrives, we order drinks -- because we like wine. But any appetizers (and or the free dip they serve) arrives much ahead of the wine. So far ahead that we only order one drink, when we'd like two ... or three (don't judge, we walk there). \n\nThen, there's the dip. It's a white bean dip with rosemary and olive oil. The drip, usually the consistency of hummus arrives drowning in oil. Yuck. I order GF pasta with broccoli added and the broccoli isn't cooked. \n\nI don't think I'll be giving them any more chances.",

And then you have to wait at your table and wait for your name to be called. Then, to add insult to injury, the portions are TINY. I literally am on my phone looking for a place to eat breakfast... after having just finished breakfast at this joke of a place.  \n\nSo, if you are in the Nashville airport area and you are longing to pay ridiculous prices for mediocre service, mediocre decor, tiny portions and middling food, by all means come to this joint.

First when I ordered the cupcakes I asked if they did a strawberry shortcake kind of cupcake ( this was for my sisters bday and she celiac and pregnant) cause that's what my sister loves and the girl said yes. I asked if the cupcake would have real strawberries in it and on top of it and she said yes! So I ordered them. I picked up the cupcakes 2 days later and as I walked in to get my cupcakes there were 3 people standing behind the counter talking and NO ONE acknowledged me. I had to say something to get someone to help me. I get the cupcakes and they look ok.. I figured the strawberries were on top as well the inside like the girl said but I didn't see any on top. Ok so I leave and when it's time to serve the cupcakes after dinner, we cut the cupcakes in half for everyone to try and just as I thought NO strawberries. Then everyone takes a bite and spits the cupcakes out all at the same time. It was crazy. The cupcakes tasted HORRIBLE!!!! I couldn't believe it. \nSo I tried to call and speak to a manager and she wasn't there. The employee had no clue when the mgr would come in. So I called for 4 days straight and still no mgr was around to help me. They didn't even know her last name or any other way to contact her. I was furious. This place is terrible. When I saw the bad reviews I still took a chance to try them out. Well I guess I should of went with the reviews. I will NEVER COME BACK TO THIS PLACE AGAIN. I even have pics to show how terrible the cupcakes were. Terrible. Disgusted.",

Either we caught the place on an off-night or the management has really taken a poor turn.  At the ordering area, the food obviously did not look fresh; it appeared to have been sitting there for many hours unrefrigerated before our arrival.  I hesitated but ordered a veggie pizza for myself and he ordered a hawaiian pizza.  It took nearly 20 minutes for our food to arrive, even though there were very few people in the restaurant.

Now the food is not that good.  Pizza has declined in quality over the last couple years.  Calamari is always soggy.  The pasta and sauces are just so-so.  \n\nNow for the reason I will NEVER return.  I placed a phone order.  I was told twenty minutes.  I went to pick it up and got there 25 minutes after my call.  I had to wait another 15 minutes.  The restaurant was not that busy.  The man who rung me up and barely spoke English hovered over me while I signed my slip, to the point that I was uncomfortable.  When he saw the tip line had a zero on it, he huffed very loudly and gave me a dirty look like he wanted to fight or something.  If I was classless like him, I might have been upset and lost sleep over it.  But knowing I will never, ever return to this horrible place actually just made it quite funny.  And when I got my food home, it was again just bland and boring.  \n\nI do not recommend this place at all anymore.  A year ago, I might have.  Two years ago I always did.  Now I recommend you avoid the average food and horrible, horrible service and lack of basic human manners and respect at all cost.",

I went for the first time in a long time last night with a few friends and the experience was ice cold.  We go there about 50 minutes before close and were greeted by the manager with no smile and a warning that they closed in 45 minutes.  That being said, all we wanted was a couple drinks and apps.  We did not do any entrees much less any dishes that required any significant time or labor, wings, my bruschetta, and one dessert on top of 3 cocktails.  Server was nice enough and very polite about replacing my first drink which came out in a glass that was nearly cracked in half.  We paid our bill right as they locked doors and let our server clean off our entire table.  We were out on the patio, assuming that it was probably the best place to be if you were going to there a little past close.  Needless to say, the manager on duty came out moments later and proclaimed \"I'm lockin' up.\"  with no smile, empathy, remorse, or hospitality.  I understand you are locking the place down for the night AND that I am there past close... but if you want to send the right message... don't be a jerk 15 minutes after you close and literally kick out all of your guests.  There are much more professional and friendly ways to handle that.  Wouldn't mind being asked to leave or step off the patio so they could locked down the store, I am not that difficult. Nor was it even that late.\n\nBoggles my mind, I've worked in this industry for a long enough time to appreciate good service and a nice place.  I am not that guest, I say thank you, pose questions politely, and only draw flaws to the attention of my server or manager when they are dire enough to be noted.  This guy was a joke, rude and unwelcoming from the get go.  I will not spend my money at a place were it feels like it's an inconvenience to have me sit at one of your tables....

So there was sat, in the lobby, as we watched the ridiculous disorganization taking place. \nAfter about 15 minutes of pacing and watching all these tables sit empty while we waited, I was getting more and more frustrated with the situation. \nFinally I said to the stoic hostess, \"either find us a table or I'm going to go clean one myself! She looked @ me with disinterest & said she found us a table. \nThe 3 of us sat down at a booth in the restaurant side. \nMy man & I ordered the \"kickin' shrimp\" as an appie (this is our fav and the ONLY reason we continue to eat here!) and decided we'd split the 14 oz ribeye @ 38$ a plate. Our guest ordered a double breast chicken dish with spinach. \nThe shrimp was good and up to our usual expectations. \nOur main courses arrived shortly there after. \nOur guest began eating and said, \"you know, my chicken is burnt I think!\"\nWe looked @ it and she turned over one of the breasts to reveal a burnt bottom! Who sends out burnt meat??? \nWe called the waitress over. She began to say that she'd asked them to add this extra piece of chicken cuz it had looked kinda small. My guest quickly shut her down and said, \" this is burnt and dry as dry can be!!!\" \"Take this back and while ur at it, send your manager over here!\" \nNow we had finished our shared ribeye (which was nothing special @ 38$ .. Including the mashed potatoes which tasted like instant!). My guest was livid. \nThe manager arrived and was somewhat apologetic. My guest begins a tirade of complaints and explains to the manager that she  won't come here, as a general rule, becuz the place is always a gong show. The manager is starting to have trouble maintaining his composure, wringing his hands as he tries to calm down my friend. He tells her that he'll be removing the plate from her bill and hopes she'll give them another try @ some point. \nI take my turn and tell the already irritated manager, about his unsmiling hostess and how bad that is for business when u walk into a place and feel unwelcome. He says he'll look into that as well and promptly turns around and makes a bee line for the kitchen... He returns momentarily with several \"to go\" boxes that my friend had requested. She's done, packs up the majority of an unfinished meal and we wait for the bill. \nThe bill arrives and the ONLY thing removed from our bill is my friend's chicken, not her shrimp she'd ordered on top of her chicken or her beverage. \nJust a suggestion Tony Roma's.. When u have an irate customer.. Remove all the guests meal, not just a portion of it!!! \nAfter all was said and done, Tony's was a poor excuse for a restaurant last nite and I would tell anyone that this place is one to be avoided in the future.",

The mailer was for a $59 room rate which expired within a week after receiving it.  I called to see if I could extend it a few days to Friday which is my wife's birthday.  We stayed last month at regular rate and didn't even get to enjoy the pool because of the monsoons.  My regular rate with AAA is $107 so because of a mere $48 in savings that I couldn't be given,  I will never return and I would have spent hundreds of extra dollars between drinks and food at the pool, other meals, and gambling all evening to have more than made up for it.  In Vegas they completely comp me twice a year because they want my business!  To me its just the principle of bad vs good customer service!",

Chicken schwarma was just shredded boiled chicken breast which was also dry. Falafel was also dry and dense and not fried fresh.  Hummus may be  house made but too acidic and not smooth. Everything was coated with tahini in an attempt to cure the dryness but it didn't help.  I also ordered a side of baba ganousch which was meh with too much acid and no smokey flavor and you get a tiny container for 5 bucks. Really the Only edible thing in the platter was the salad. \n\nI am usually not picky and will generally eat and like anything. But I could barely eat the food I ordered. I would say that the generic schwarma carts all around the city are better and they are by no means good. Maybe they were having an off day because I can't believe that everyone who gave this place great reviews ate the same food I ate today. The staff did seem a bit confused back there. Did something recently change?  For now I would say save your money and eat pretty much anywhere else.",

They were out of EVERYTHING when we arrived, which made me assume my food would be tasty. The black eyed peas tasted like they were just boiled. Had something weird looking in it maybe bacon, but absolutely no flavor. Cabbage was the same, just boiled. Not exactly sure why we had to wait 20 minutes for food that they popped in the microwave. I'm assuming at one point over the years they served cornbread, well no longer. My bf got fried fish and chicken; it all tasted like flour. The mac and cheese was super dry and burnt, and tasted like boiled noodles nothing else. Sweet potatoes are definitely from a can, probably why they taste so good in comparison to everything else. We only went here because we had a free gift card. STILL wound up spending like 20 bucks. Wasn't worth the drive we made half way across the city. And having to listen to the cook curse and complain about working there made those 20 minutes seem even less fruitful. Definitely won't be back.",

Never mind we paid for the room in advance.  And to top it off the young lady checking us in made me feel as if the hotel's lack of availability for the room type we reserved was my fault.  Candidly, I was too tired to argue with her as we had spent nine hours driving and I should have asked some questions so this is partly my fault - obviously the young lady at the front desk did a great job of making me feel like the was my fault.\n\nI will tell you this...Nick, the young man who helped us with our car and initial greeting outside was fantastic.  We had three experiences with him and he was amazingly helpful.  Perhaps Nick the Valet should be giving training to those in the front office and at the front desk relative to customer service.\n\nAs Jerry Seinfeld said, \"...you know how to take the reservation, you just don't know how to \"hold\" the reservation, and that's really the most important part of the reservation, the holding.\"",

I will not return. It's not the wait that bothered me it's the lack of contact and any good waiter knows if the wait is long you stop by with something to munch on.

We did see dolphins while waiting.\nI ordered the grouper sandwich and it came on a stale bun, wilted lettuce and tomato. The grouper was over cooked and rubbery. My daughter ordered the crab cake sandwich. The bun was also stale. She said she felt ill about an hour after eating the dinner. \nService lacked as well. Nobody would seat us and the wait staff was not friendly at all. What a horrible experience.... Do not eat there!!!!!!",

Then she was unable to understand that I WOULD NOT PAY for that, so she charged me ANYWAY without telling me. So i paid for 2 meals. One of which I DID NOT EVEN CONSUME! STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE!

Decided to try the place because we see it all the time when we eat at Carrabas. We walk in and see one employee sitting at the bar --reading a paperback. He looks up and says, \"Oh, just sit anywhere. \". We sat ourselves and menus were brought to us. About 10 minutes later, he got up and asked if we wanted to order. By this time, we really didn't, but were already invested in the bad experience, that we went ahead and ordered. The food took forever  and was horrible. The sauce tasted like someone opened a can of Hunts tomato sauce and poured it on the enchiladas. There were no refills of drinks, and I had to go get him (still reading his novel) when it was time for us to pay. I thought, \"What a slug\". Horrible service, horrible food, and horrible experience. The place was so mismanaged -- rest room was filthy, from training of employees to quality of food. It has the air of a place on its way out, rather than on its way to the top. I recommend that you avoid this place.",

The option to sit outside, sounded amazing however, we were left neglected. Waiting for along time for drinks, (approx. a 1/2 hour) food and service. For the price, atmosphere and service was not worth the effort to plan a Sunday here. Let alone, when leaving the restaurant was bare inside. Not sure, with the excuse they were short staffed by the server, where everyone was during our dining experience, not even apologetic nor a manger to come to check on the experience.

I went there based upon the 4.5 star review hoping for a great little sandwich place in the Metairie side of town. The grocery store looked pretty great, but the sandwich bar on a Saturday at lunchtime was abysmal, and the worst place I've paid money to eat since moving here several weeks ago. \n\nThe service consisted of \"What do you want?\" followed by the staff contuing their conversation and offering no help at all. The turkey sandwich my wife bought was shaved lettice and tomato on a plain white hamburger bun. Hardly worth the $7 we paid. My \"hot sausage po boy\" was some kind of pressed mass of orange meat with more shredded \"lettuce\".  The only redeemable thing about the whole meal was the package of cole slaw that made it edible. If you're looking for a grocery store, definitely check it out; but if you're looking for a sandwich or a po boy, pass it by. It's an amateurish half-hearted attempt.",

The driver said he had a diet coke in the car, then I watched him drive away. I was not sure if he was coming back! About 15 minutes later, he showed up again with a diet coke for me. I have literally ordered from this location three times, and each time have been disappointed. \n\nMy recommendation? Order from another Domino's location, or drive yourself there to pick it up.

The guac which should be a very vibrant green was dark brown. I called them immediately to let them know.

He then came back on and asked me what it was in reguards to so I told him. About 3 minutes later the manager picked up and simply said \"hello\". She didnt introduce herself, didnt appologize for the hold, or anything. So I then said , \"Hi, did the gentleman tell you why I am calling\" and she said no he didnt. So I explained to her again. She told me the guac was made last night and thats why it looked that way and that I can come back in for a refund... So many things about this expierence and this phone call were so wrong!

    "text": "I have to admit I'm surprised by my experience. When I saw this place had over 200 ratings and a 4.5 average I expected something more than what I got.  I ordered the falafel platter which came with Tabouleh salad, hummus, mixed vegetables & a side of pita.\n\nAs a whole, everything seemed to be at least a day old. Everything was very stale and just did not feel right as you attempted to chew it.  If I ever storm a castle and have archers firing at me from atop a tower, I would like to be wearing armor made from the falafel because I would be unstoppable.  The pita, I would not serve to small children nor the elderly because it's a choking hazard. It had the consistency of that fruit leather you used to get from the cafeteria in elementary school. \n\nYou know how if you put a lot of sugar in your coffee people make that joke \"You want some coffee with your sugar?\" Well that's what they would say about the amount of parsley in the Tabbouleh.  I understand Tabbouleh is supposed to have a lot of parsley, but this was to the point where I couldn't call it Tabbouleh.  They just gave me straight up minced parsley with a countable amount bulgur grains that seem to have accidentally fallen in.\n\nThe hummus was not that bad. It tasted like it had a bit too much lemon juice going on and maybe could have used a bit more tahini, but overall it was just ok.\n\nThe overall taste of everything was not bad, but it did not resemble anything that I would call close to good. Think of a delicious cheesesteak from Pat's or Gino's or Dalessandro's that's a day or two old.  It would taste like it's a day or two old, but you could still tell that it would have been delicious had it been fresh. I can't say that with the meal I just had from Smiley's.  It didn't taste bad like I could not stand putting it into my mouth, but I can't say I found it even pleasant. I'd get as excited for it as I would for a plain bowl of oatmeal made with water.\n\nI think I rate very fairly and it hurts me that I have to give this establishment such a low rating. I will admit that there is a possibility that, given the other stellar reviews, I may have just had a rare bad experience. Unfortunately, that is all I have to go off of. I may try it again some day if I'm with somebody who really wants to go there.  Until then, no thanks.",

    "text": "DUNEDIN BAGELS & DELI\nI picked up bagels here EVERY week & loved them! My very first job, at 15, was at a bagel shop in NJ with New York owners, Norman & Miriam Fleischman. I know a great water bagel when I taste one. However, I bought a half dozen cinnamon raisin bagels that tasted like onion. The first one tasted like onion. I thought that it, perhaps, came in contact with an onion bagel; no problem. The 2nd one tasted like onion & I thought then that they didn't properly clean their oven. After tasting the 3rd bagel, I called them to ask for 6 more. Well, the owner was angry & inappropriate. He sniffed each of the 3 bagels that I returned & said, \"they don't smell like onion!\" (Accusing me of lying?! Really?!?!) I would have simply apologized & replaced the 6 bagels...that simple. He said, \"you take bite, you taste onion, you bring back!\" I tried to explain that I thought it might have just been the one bagel. He got angrier & forcefully threw the remaining bagels in the trash before handing me a new bag of 6. Well, he lost a loyal customer for nothing!!!!!!! BEWARE; do not cross the boss!!!!!",

    "text": "I am an ex-server for olive garden. It is one of my favorite restaurants and I drove over half an hour to eat there with two of my friends on Thursday may 31st. Our servers were Tracey and mikayla, whose was training, and I was extremely disappointed in the service that we recieved.\nI'd like to highlight first the some service that met the outstanding expectations that I know olive garden expects.\nWhen we arrived we were seated right away and our server in training introduced herself fairly quickly. We were given adequate time to look at the menu and make our selections. Our first round of salad and bread sticks, along with our appetizer very quickly. After this though the whole atmosphere and attitude seemed to change.\nOur tray of breadsticks and salad stood empty for almost 20 minutes after that initial  round. One of the reasons I love olive garden is because of the refills on salad, soup, and breadsticks. While we waited on someone to recognize that we needed refills, a tray of dirty dishes sat out in the dining room for approximately 30 minutes across from our table. Our main courses came out before our second round of salad and breadsticks and when I recieved my entree the sauce in the ravioli de portabellas that I had ordered congealed and the entree was cold. I flagged down a server as no one had asked us how are meal was. Although my meal was replaced with no question, it came out after both of my friends were finished eating and had recieved to-go boxes, so I was eating my meal alone. After we were all done eating, everything was boxed up, and dishes were cleared we then waited over another 15 minutes for my dessert to-go and our check. Finally when we did receive our check it was the wrong one. Thankfully I was planning on paying with a credit card so I didn't just leave money on the table and walk out. \nAgain I am very disappointed in the service I recieved tonight. The problem with our service is that there was no direction from the server that was training the new employee. Tracey seemed to be more worried about a large party that was sitting behind us but made a point to mention in passing that mikayla better do good tonight because she was making her money. Now I understand the basis behind why trainees give their tips to their trainer, as I went through the training myself, but tracy was not guiding her, checking on the table or shadowing her anyway. I feel like mikayla was sent out to the wolves with no food.",

I ordered the jambalaya, I've heard that it is a traditional New Orleans dish, and I was clear that it was not fresh and had been sitting out.  The rice was mushy and cold.  For the price it was not worth it at all.  I will go somewhere else for dinner to make up for the experience.",

With all the good reviews on Pho, I decided to order one(the Specialty).  We also ordered the combination appetizer platter.  I am sorry, but this is the worst Pho that I have ever eaten.  I couldn't even finish it, that's how bad it is since I always try to finish my food no matter what.  \n\nI feel bad for the locals since they're probably never been to Bolsa in CA, Houston, or Virginia.  Trust me, once you try the Pho or even the food in other places, there's no way you can come back here and rate this high.  But when you hardly have any Vietnamese restaurants in Indy, I don't blame you.",

The bad came when the hostess dual hatted as the bartender and we had to wait ten minutes staring at open tables before getting sat. We were offered free drinks as consolation which was nice but the waiting didn't end there. The waitress took forever taking our order and the food took about 30 minutes to arrive after ordering. Food finally came and there was nothing exciting about it. Blonde Benedict: eggs were so undercooked they were clear and fruit was underripe at best. Sunshine unlimited: it's an egg sandwich and a pretty crappy one at that. It was bland, needed salt (none on the table), and overall underwhelming. I would not recommend this place to anyone.",

    "text": "One word to describe this place - AWFUL. I ordered take out from here a few weeks ago. It was a Sunday night, around 7 o'clock. They told me to pick it up in 30 minutes (I ordered a grilled chicken sandwich with lettuce and tomato and Maria's sandwich which consists of prosciutto, mozzarella, and tomato). I thought 30 minutes was a little excessive but figured they were probably busy with dinner service. So I arrive to pick up my food about 35-40 minutes later. Not one car in the parking lot, not one person in the restaurant area and I'm told my food is STILL not ready. I ended up waiting an additional 15 minutes for a piece of grilled chicken and a COLD sandwich. The grilled chicken should not take too long on the grill and the other sandwich didn't even require cooking!! The girl at the front desk was not apologetic at all. The cook came out 3 times to talk/flirt with the girls at the front desk. All around it was very unprofessional. \n\nSo I get home to try my sandwich and was not pleased at all. The grilled chicken sandwich was literally a piece of flavorless chicken served on a hamburger bun. Yes, a hamburger bun. The other sandwich was not for me but I had to try it. Again, flavorless. I will not be going back here ever again. For the record, this was probably my 3rd or 4th time ordering from here only due to the fact that it's right down the street from me, and every time I've had to wait a long time for food and/or the food was not good. I've eaten at the other location in Conshohocken before and have been pleased but this location is horrible. Save your time and order elsewhere.",

    "text": "Went there for lunch before they moved locations and myself and husband were pretty impressed.  Just think about how excited we were to hear that they were now open for breakfast at their new location! \n\nWe visited there on a Sunday morning for breakfast.  Husband isn't home that much due to work so we wanted to enjoy a sit down breakfast together before running our errands for the day and thought we would try out the new breakfast menu (Belgian waffle with side of bacon for me and Disco Ball for my husband).  Walked in to no line at all and placed our order at the counter.  Went around to pay, grab our fruit tea, and took a seat.  We looked around and noticed what appeared to be a couple people (I'm assuming at this point) ordered food after their group did.  Didn't really think anything of it.  After approx. 20 mins, my name is called. They put my Belgian waffle down (no sign of side of bacon) and tell us that my husband's meal is right behind them.  My husband didn't want my food to get cold so told me to go ahead without him.  I ate my ENTIRE waffle and he still didn't have his food.  Plates were slowly making their way from the kitchen to the other people's tables. My husband still waiting for his.  I finally go to the counter and ask about his plate.  They hand me a plate that was sitting on the counter and says \"Breakfast takes longer to cook.\"  Ummmmmmmmm....ok..  They didn't seem apologetic in the slightest even though I told them that I've already finished my breakfast.  I took his plate to him and went back up for my side of bacon.  He literally finished his food before my side of bacon was brought to the table.  His food was cold and the look of the meat on his plate was questionable.  The quiche was pretty good though!\n\nNeedless to say, our planned nice sit down breakfast together turned out to be far from our expectations which included a price tag of $30.  If you go for breakfast and plan to eat TOGETHER...you may want to take a snack to eat while others in your party enjoy their plates one by one.",

We arrived here at 5:00pm on a Sunday and ordered 2 appetizers and a salad.  After inquiring about the long wait, our server seemed unconcerned and told us they were busy.  It took 50 minutes for our food to come out, with no apology.  My meal was cold.  I informed the manager of our long wait and cold food, and although she offered to comp my meal, she did not offer any other solutions or see if I wanted anything else.  It's a shame because we like this place and would like to continue to support our neighborhood restaurant.",

I was optimistic going in because Chuck is from Texas and from his social media posts and menu, I got the sense that his food would be solid. Unfortunately, I couldn't have been more wrong. \n\nI ordered the two meat platter - brisket, pulled pork, mac salad and potato salad along with an order of original wings and the only thing remotely good about the entire order was the jalapeno cornbread. The brisket and pork with both extremely bland with absolutely no smoke ring or smoke flavor. In fact they tasted boiled. I can't understand how this could be if that meat was in fact inside a smoker. \n\nThe two sides were both bland as well. I looked hard and couldn't see any spices in either of them. I then moved on to the original wings. Again, the meat was bland with no seasoning and what tasted like a bottled BBQ sauce. No smoke/grill flavor whatsoever.  \n\nI'm at a complete loss for how a BBQ place with a pitmaster from Texas could serve up food like this.",

    "text": "Very disappointed with the experience I had last evening. My friends and I decided on a girls night that began with dinner at Friendlys and ended with a movie close by. We ordered our food at 6pm- so we could leave by 7, for a movie that started at 7:20. None of us ordered anything fancy- chicken fingers, a wrap, a sandwich. At 6:50 our food finally came, and we quickly had to scarf it down in order to leave. (We did let our server know we were headed to the movies after dinner, there was only 5 of us) This was extremely disappointing, even though they offered is boxes to take with us...which honestly, we couldn't even do since we would be at a movie for a few hours. \n\n\nWe expressed our disappointment to the \"Manager,\" who never even looked up, made eye contact, or engaged in a conversation when we shared with her our experience. All she said was \"I gave you a little something off\"- Which was $1.50 off the entire check. It wasn't even the discount that irked me- We were looking for someone to validate and at least pretend they were concerned about our experience, and even that was too difficult to do. \n\nI would just eat at the theater or head to Red Robbins if you're looking for a quick bite to eat. Apparently, the fry times for Friendlies chicken fingers, fries, etc exceed over 20 minutes.",

Well I tried it for 2 days and returned it.  However I didn't know that I couldn't get my phone back or at least a refurbished phone at the same value of what I owed.  Basically if I would return my iPhone 8 to go back down to iPhone 7 then I will get a new iPhone 7 and restart not only the contract, but sadly start at zero again which means the iPhone 7 will cost me $800.  So let me think about this I can return my iPhone 8 and go back to iPhone 7 for $800.  Sounds like a deal right?  At least I could of been informed before making the deal.  Spoke to the manager Megan Rivas and she said sorry, but is the policy.  Sad how companies policies are set up to make money.",

Ok, not so bad so far. First issue: we specifically asked for a game to be on their TVs when we made the reservation, and they assured us that the bar would be playing that game. They did not play that game. Oh well, not really a big deal.\n\nHey, that reminds me. Didn't we put in for drinks and oysters half an hour ago? Where are they? After another 15 minutes, a separate waiter comes and gets our drinks, finally. After another 15 minutes, no oysters, so we decide to put in our orders. Maybe the oysters have escaped.\n\nOur oysters finally come after an hour of waiting for them, and they're ok. My matza ball soup is pretty much tasteless. The broth has a slight chicken flavor but other than that, nothing. The gumbo my friends got was tiny. Our waiter has now not talked to us or checked on us in well over an hour. He is busy talking to the bachelorette party and some random guy at the bar. Our other waiter is busy with his own tables, but makes more of an effort to check in on us probably 3 times over the course of a 2.5 hour marathon restaurant experience.\n\nNow I get my entree, the fried oyster salad. The only redeeming quality of this salad is the bacon. Everything else was pretty much worthless. They oysters tasted slightly of salt, but that's it. \n\nThe bread pudding was only good for the topping and ice cream. Once you run out of sauce, it became literally a semi-thick, unsweet dough. \n\n0/5 terrible experience.",

    "text": "We ate here a few weeks ago and enjoyed the food.  So we decided to go back and have a nice dinner.  The place was crowded and we had to wait 30 minutes for a table.  Once seated our server took our order which was a main entr\u00e9e and a side salad.  In about 5 to 10 minutes we received our salads.  Everything was going just fine; we finished our salads and were enjoying the bread and wine.  \n\nAfter some time we realized we had drank two glasses of wine and finished the bread, but had not received our entr\u00e9e.  Our waiter never came by to check on us or explain why it was taking so long to get our entr\u00e9e.  So we asked the manager if she could check our order.  Come to find out the waiter never placed our order! \n\nWe sat there for an hour eating salad, bread and wine and our order was never entered.  We were giving the place the benefit of the doubt that they were busy and had gotten backed-up in the kitchen. We even over heard the table next to us ask our same waiter why it was taking so long to get their order.  We just did not realize how much time had passed until we ran out of conversation.  Wow!  The level of incompetence at this place is extraordinary. \n\nThe manager was very apologetic.  She was embarrassed at the level of service we received and made no excuses.  She of course comp our meal and offered to expedite the order so we could eat.  However, there is no excuse for this type of mistake.  Hiring staff that are incompetence is unacceptable.   Unfortunately, we will not be supporting a business that can't hire a professional waitstaff.",

We eventually left the restaurant after AN HOUR of sitting, waiting for a chef to show up. The manager, who'd told us when he moved us that we'd have a chef in a matter of minutes, absolutely knew that we'd been waiting forever yet still acted clueless when we told him we were leaving, like it was just a normal thing that you'd wait for AN HOUR before someone even shows up to make your dinner.

    "text": "This is the second time my husband and I have come to Josef's - expressly to get an assortment of cookies - so I can't speak on behalf of the meals they serve.\n\nJust before the holidays, we came in to get a dozen cookies. Since they were just for my husband and I, I thought even 12 cookies was extravagant. There was only one gal behind the cash register helping a short line of customers. The service was VERY slow. When our turn came, I mentioned that I wanted just an assortment of cookies. Immediately, the gal tried to HARD SELL me on the pre-made-up platters of cookies that were heaped on a large table in the entrance area. I kept saying \"NO, that's too many!\" But she just wouldn't listen, and kept telling me that this assortment was ready to go. \n\nWhen I *finally* got her to listen to me - the customer - I told her I wanted just one cookie from each line in the top two shelves of the display cabinet. Over and over and over and over I had to repeat this ridiculously simply request. Even my hubs was wondering if the gal understood English? She kept asking what we wanted, and then 15 min into putting some of the cookies into a box, I said, \"So what have we got here?\" And she said, I've got 5 cookies - what else did you want? Seriously, it was like some kind of skit on SNL. How difficult is it to grab ONE each of SIX different cookies on TWO shelves? We got the cookies and I have to admit: they were DELICIOUS! I think cookies (and probably cakes & pastries) baked at the holidays are bound to be good and fresh because of the turnover.\n\nFlash forward to yesterday. We returned with a sweet tooth to get just six cookies for us. One gal behind the counter was on the phone as we approached the cash register. She remained on the phone a couple of minutes (with no greeting whatsoever), then hung up and disappeared in back. Um. OK. Anyone HOME? After waiting 5 minutes, a different gal came out to take our order. This time, we got the cookies we asked for and went home to try them. HORRIBLE! \n\nWe took a bite from 4 of our 6 cookies purchased, and found they tasted like rock hard sawdust. I am not kidding. I bake cookies myself, and I know that when you bake them fresh - DAILY - they should be moist and tender. Yes, they look pretty all dolled up in frosting and daubs of jam, but the flavor is absolutely flat - not a hint of butter or sugar in them. I guess they use lard? I also suspect that the cookies stored under the hot lights of the display case are not only dried out beyond repair, but were probably baked a good week ago. I broke a Cary cookie in half and it just shattered like glass! The cookie was dry as a biscotti, and tasted like some kind of stale dog biscuit. \n\nThese cookies are an insult to Josef (if he is even alive and cares what is baked and sold in his store). We will not be returning to Josef's again for ANY dessert of any kind ever. I was so mad about these stale biscuit cookies I chucked them all in the garbage. Money down the drain. \n\nYou may as well get a small cookie or two at Whole Foods, or even a small box of infinitely fresher cookies at Trader Joe's! Josef's so-called Vienna Bakery is a total Fakery.",

First, they flat out lied to me that they could not validate my restaurant.com certificate. My bad, I guess I should've listened to the one yelper that shared the same experience. Don't bother ordering $10 shrimp tacos, the shrimp are flavorless and the \"soft corn tacos\" were an abomination that I really don't know how to describe properly. I had heard such great things about their ceviche, so i decided to order the campechana. It is now sitting in my refrigerator until I figure out a way to salvage the shrimp from that disaster. The octopus is a total loss though. If you don't know how to prepare octopus without turning it into shoe leather,  do not serve it at your establishment. I honestly feel embarrassed for these people. I'm pretty certain it's generally a bad idea to throw some seafood in a cup with a bunch of ketchup and sugar, and have the balls to think that it's ok. If I could give negative stars, I would. I hope this place shuts down. The only positive is that my senior citizen relative enjoyed the asada burrito. If she had been disappointed I probably would have written a much longer review of this nightmare. It is a disgrace to food trucks across this great nation.

The service was untrained and uneven. The main course came before the appetizers (the amount of mussels for cost was pathetic). All of the orders had food delivered incorrectly and had to be taken back for adjustments. The \"steamed\" vegetables were raw, the Mahi Mahi was so dry it couldn't be swallowed. I sent my dinner back refusing any more indignation and was still charged. With much discussion with management and server to adjust an inflated, incorrect bill, and very little apologies, we left shaken and unhappy.",

I decide to take a trip there to see what's going on (since my credit card was charged). They said they just opened, even though the website said they've been open since noon. Ok, looks like a glitch in the system that left me hungry. No problem, you would think they would try and resolve the issue by offering to make the food, or giving me some sort of discount/credit/whatever to make me happy. Instead the guy grabs the order off the printer and says I need to call their online ordering vender to get my money back. Talk about terrible customer service. They are destined for failure.",

We came here found a table and nothing else was accomplished except I did get my sweet tea. It was downhill from there. We got there at 3 and we left at 3:52. We never got our drinks we ordered with my sweet tea. All the manager could say was the bar is backed up I'm sorry. We never got our apps or any other food. Only the sweet tea in 45 mins. No drinks we ordered or anything else. Our server walked around like she wasn't bothered and didn't have a care in the world. Just taking a stroll around the area and had such a calm passive attitude about how long it was taking. Horrible first experience. Won't be going back even with the kids.",

I told the waiter to not give my husband his English muffin because he can't have gluten and there it was on the dish and then he took it off when I reminded him, the waiter that is but his hands.I also asked for egg whites with cheese on the side but was charged for nasty home fries and a horrible English muffin as well. I do not recommend this place as after the hot water disguise as coffee was replaced with the French press that too is hot water disguised as coffee. We are avid coffee drinker's so after our meal we went to Starbucks to get real coffee.  Save your money and go somewhere else.",

    "text": "This was hands down one of the worst dining experiences that I've ever had in Philadelphia.  Ultimately, Xochitl gets one star because I do not have a \"no star\" option.  My friend and I dined here last night for restaurant week and had really been looking forward to it.  Neither of us had been before, so we thought Philadelphia's Restaurant Week would be a great place to give it a shot.  WRONG.\n\nWe arrived on time for our 7 pm reservation and were asked to wait in the bar area until our table was ready.  Not a problem.  And understandable on a Friday evening. Although the restaurant was not at capacity we didn't think twice about being asked to wait. About five minutes later, we were seated and our very nice server came to explain the menu and the customizable guacamole.  \n\nWe made our guacamole selection and placed the order for the remainder of our 3 courses.  As far as the food goes, the guacamole was the best thing we had.  I ordered sangria that was supposed to have peaches, but instead had grapes and apples.  I'm not saying that's impermissible, but it's totally different.  Lol.  Just saying.\nAnyway, from there, the courses went down hill.  The four cheese empanadas were a bit undercooked.  My main course, which the waitress described as their signature dish, was ok but did not make a real impression.  And the dessert....the churros.  I thought that was a safe choice.  WRONG.  They're probably normally excellent, but when I bit into it instead of the lovely, sugary sweetness that I was expecting, I tasted onion and garlic and lots of other savory spices.  Perhaps they had a shortage of oil in the kitchen.  Who knows?  \n\nBUT HERE'S THE REAL PROBLEM: Our waitress brought us the bill and we were winding down when the manager, Adam, came over to our table and said, \"ladies, I hope you've enjoyed yourselves and that you will come again.  If you'd like to continue enjoying yourself, I suggest you go to the bar, but we need the table.\"  Now is probably when I should point out that there were other vacant tables in the dining room and that the couple next to us was in the process of leaving, But I digress.  Apparently there was some special reason why he needed our table.  So we proceed to stare at him like he was crazy.  He took that as his cue to continue talking.  He said, \"we've been TRYING TO WORK AROUND YOU, but you've been here for THREE HOURS and we need the table.\"  We had not been there for three hours, it was slightly over two, and it was a four course meal. Moreover, we had to wait for our table.  Ultimately, however, if their primary concern is just turning tables and not providing a nice dining experience, then they shouldn't be in the restaurant business, nor should they participate in Restaurant Week.  \n\nWhen we started gathering our belongings, my friend asked the manager to move because he was blocking her chair.  After which he said, \"I don't allow people to talk to me like that.\"  This was unbelievable.   I have never been treated so poorly by a staff member at a restaurant...EVER.  I would not be able to recommend this establishment to my worst frenemy.",

I then proceeded to say that I ordered banana peppers, in which the rude lady quickly said that they didn't have. SO WHY DIDN'T YOU SAY THAT WHEN I ORDERED?!!?!?! I would have ordered something else.

A one time trip to the ingredient bar is $9 while a All-You-Can eat option is $13.

The almost impossible to hear cashier/waitress said only the all you can eat option is available after 4pm. I told her I don't want that and she said she'd give me a box for my second bowl. $14.50 with no drink plus they wanted a tip. \nAfter I ate my first bowl, I had my second bowl made and had a few bites. I was ready for my box. The other almost silent waitress, suddenly very audible, said I couldn't have one it was against policy. I told her what the other girl said and she told me that was \"impossible\" because the girl knew better and had worked there a very long time. I went to the register to confront the girl who denied she made me that offer. I told her she lied with my voice raised a bit and the dominant waitress handed me the smallest box possible. I packed my bowl and left. Ironically, I even tipped them, a self service restaurant.",

I have had chicken and beef fried rice many times in my life and there was no way that was fried rice. More like warmed up/steamed plain old white rice that was clumpy and hardly had anything in it. There was no vegetable in the rice. I honestly don't know what that was. I tried the ginger beef and it was way overly spicey and soggy. The egg roll was soggy as well and seriously had nothing inside it besides bean sprouts that tasted really bad. Not what i would call an egg roll. I tried the fried chicked that was on the buffet and that was pretty good. Overall i was disappointed though and will not go back.",

    "text": "MEGU BAIT AND SWITCH PRICES. \n\nIf I could give it 0 stars I would.  \n\nI am a bit thrifty but we did some research about where to eat hibachi without killing the bank account.  We love Yokohama but figured we would try a less expensive alternative. \n\nThe menu prices ranged from 16.95 for\nChicken to around 18.95 for other selections like steak.   Plus they offered a $15 coupon on their website.     Needless to say when we get there he's is a laminated piece of paper with all prices at\nLeast $6 more entree.  \n\nI brought it quietly to the managers attention and inquired.  I was told I had an old website and the manager showed me the new website on my phone and I said I understood.  I quickly looked at the new website and the prices were still much lower on the menu.   I showed the manager and she abruptly told me that those prices are for takeout.   Who orders takeout hibachi with soup, salad and rice anyway?  I quickly looked at the website again and there was actually a second tab for the regular hibachi menu vs. a tab for takeout and surprise......  prices were still more then 20% less than the plastic laminated bait and switch menu.  \n\nNow  she said it's all about the presentation at the restaurant ( that is what tips are for) and was still very rude.  I sat back down and when my family realized that the restaurant was fraudulent they chose to leave and go elsewhere.   I offered to pay for my son's coke and we left.  The \"customer is always right\" is surely not followed at Megu.   \n\nI think I would have just told a party that they would honor the menu prices rather than lose customers.  \n\nWe went to Yokohama and if I could give them 6 stars I would.   This place and owner don't deserve business.",

The nabeyaki udon was so over done, the noodle was soggy, the veggies cooked to mush and chicken dry.  We also had calamari which was tasteless only saved by the hot sauce.

Once you get more than 5 people in the store, you're literally pressed up against each other as you try to open the fridge doors. If you go before 4pm, you'll have room to shop, but the staff the works during the day don't know shit about beer, including one woman who doesn't drink beer at all. The night time staff is more on the ball.\n\nThere are literally dozens of other bottle shops now that have better selection and lower prices (Beer Heaven, Beer Love, the Bottle Shop, Pennsport Beer Boutique, the Beer Peddlers, etc.), so it's not worth it to pay the extra $5-$10 per bottle unless you're really, really lazy.

When I tried to send mine back for a baked potato I was told that they don't serve baked potatoes on Sunday. I also wanted creamed horseradish and was informed that they might possibly be out of that as well, so I asked for sour cream to mix with the straight horseradish. By this time the bartender (subbing as a waitress) was becoming visibly agitated with my persistent requests.  I was planning to order 2 additional prime rib dinners to take home to my husband and son-in-law, but I wasn't about to give this place any more money for their poor choices and now an attitude from a food server.  So I phoned in my order to the Outback Steakhouse where (for the same money) we got our choice of potatoes, AND choice of vegetable, AND we also got warm baked bread.",

My guess is the awful waitress thought we were tourists (we live less than 4 blocks away from the restaurant) and for some reason, she didn't want her table taken up by us... even though the place was pretty empty at the time... this witch of a waitress flat out lied to us, saying that Reveillon had ended on Christmas at their and all of the other restaurants... we were quite mystified but accepted it and left... ended up eating sushi at at little place on Decatur. \n\nAnyway, while planning our New Year's Eve, I had been looking through Nola.com and discovered that Reveillon was indeed still going at not only Galatoire's 33, but all the other restaurants. This despicable waitress (I wish I could remember her name) at this over-priced restaurant deserves to have its business go in the take... the laughable kicker in the whole situation... my wife is a best selling travel author (numerous travel guides to her name, including a best selling New Orleans guide for Moon Handbooks). Don't give you business to this snobby, greedy restaurant or its mother restaurant... don't support anyone that would lie to customers simply to keep their tables open for someone who would pay their high prices vs going with the fixed meal price of Reveillon... pathetic!",

Seeing no other flat spots, I sat it on the floor before realizing the floor was soaked with some kind of liquid that didn't appear to be clear.  I quickly snatched it up, finished and went out to grab what I needed.\n\nWhile checking out, I told the cashier that their restroom wasn't very clean and it needed immediate attention.  He stared straight through me like I was crazy and only talked to my husband.  He mumbles he was going to pass along my concerns to the lady running the self-check out, we see him telling her and she literally just stares me down.  I said aloud that if my purse is discolored I would be back the next day to complain and they continued to stare at me.\n\nI have never had more rude customer service than I did tonight.  I am not a stranger to retail an usually you are told the customer is always right and everything will be done to make sure they are happy.  I did not walk away feeling like this.\n\nLuckily this was just on the way home from a game.  I will probably not return to this one unless I absolutely have to.",

    "text": "I came across Newk's Eatery at the Lobster Festival that was held at the Kapok Tree venue in Clearwater. I read good reviews about the restaurant so I was glad to see them there. The food was very good especially the Shrimp salad that my new friend and I had. Plus the Lobster Bisque was excellent.\n\nHowever, the service was not. Closed to closing of the festival my friend who was a vendor there told me that they had lowered their prices. So I want over there. The manager told me the price for the shrimp salad went down to $7.00 from $10.00. So I purchased two of them. I should have been charged $14.00 plus tax. You would think so. Instead the manager charged me the full price and it came out to be $21.50. Big difference. I complained to the manager at the booth and she did nothing. I called the store later and spoke to Tim the manager on duty and explained it to him and he told me to call back on Monday. I call the store on Monday and spoked to the General Manager who happened to be the same person that was at the booth at the show and she said she would refund my money. I was only interested in the difference between what I was charged and what I should have been charged.\nThe manager said she would give me a full refund. That was Monday. It is now Thursday and I am still waiting.",

The host had the worst attitude and was completely rude and told me it didn't matter if I had a reservation. The next day I went and picked up an order since everyone kept talking about how good the food is. Walked in and was never approached by anyone. I had to ask someone to help me after a few minutes and she was worse than the guy that was rude to us the day before. After looking at me up and down and giving me a dirty look she got my food and cashed me out. I asked her for a receipt and you would think it was the end of the world. She went in the back and didn't come back for almost 10 minutes with my receipt. The food was ok.

Maybe, they're busy.\n\nI go inside and there are two customers sitting down awaiting their order.

Maybe he wasn't in a chaat-y mood?\n\nAnother customer rolls in and walks to the counter. The worker suddenly comes over to him to shoot the shit like they're old friends.\n\nNope, I'm out.\n\nI've worked retail before. I can understand if you're busy and can't pick up the phone or take down my order right away. But ignoring me and then dropping what you're doing to talk to someone who came in afterwards was just bad customer service.\n\nFrom other reviews that I've read, the owner is fine and friendly, but the younger employee isn't -- especially, when it is just him there.\n\nI'll update the review if/when I get to actually try out the place.\n\nEdited for clarity, because someone/Yelp thinks that I posted this to the wrong restaurant.",

I frequently traveled from South Philly to buy sandwiches, but on my last few visits, the experience was horrible.  There is a new cook who simply is unskilled or uncaring about making sandwiches.  This lack of skill or disdain shows up in the quality of the food.  The woman that takes the orders gets more miserable by the visit.  The cook has changed and it is not for the better.  My last visit I had a confrontation with the cook about pickles on the side.  Even the other employees seemed embarrassed that this was going on.  If you have heard of Larry's reputation for great food, please move on.  That day has passed and the customer service absolutely sucks.  It's sad to see a well regarded establishment come to this!  I read in other reviews that the management changed and it has.  When the Girard Avenue store opened, I thought it was a lousy place to be piggy-backing off the Larry's name, but now the 54th Street store has fallen to its level instead of the other way around.",

The international house of pancakes shouldn't be screwing up pancakes. When I order sausage they give me bacon. When I order chocolate chip pancakes they give me blueberry.

When I brought the vehicle at 10:45 for an 11:00 appointment it took over an hour just to get it into the garage. It was not completed until 1:00 and at that time the cashier told me she doesn't know how to process a fleet vehicle and would have to wait for a manager. She then said the manager is on a conference call which usually takes about 30 minutes. Poor service and concept of time. I will never be back to this shop and if you cherish the time in your day I suggest you don't either. I would have given them negative stars if it was possible. Oh yea they also charged $98 for the oil change and new wiper blades.",

Pancakes are still garbage. $3 plastic sausages are garbage. Service is still garbage. \n\nAbout the service. I ordered grits with cheese with my pancakes, sausage and home fries.. Do not order the grits with cheese. The \"cheese\" is a piece of Kraft American cheese cut up with a knife and put in a lump below your grits. The grits aren't even hot enough to melt the cheese fully and it is disgusting. The grits themselves are OK, but the cheese absolutely sucks and it costs extra.\n\nAnyhow, I got my grits and my waitress said, \"Check to see if there's cheese in there\". So I put my fork in there and mixed around the grits. I did not see cheese. She said, \"oh, sorry, I mixed this one up.\" So she picks up my grits, walks over three tables and SERVES THEM THE GRITS THAT I HAD JUST PLAYED WITH. She then picked up a bowl of grits FROM THEIR TABLE and gave it to me. Not exactly like sneezing into something and serving it to me, but damn close. \n\nJust go to IHOP. It's the same thing but so much cheaper.",

We got in after 1 hr wait. During that hour we sat in a hot entry way with a squeaky door..no air condition with weather in hot humid 90s. After 45 mins, I ordered coffee from walk up bar.  They got it wrong..has to wait to remake. There was water pooled up in front of coffee station..no one was mopping it. Finally get seated outside counter. We gave order right away because we wanted to check in at our hotel and enjoy some pool time.  We waited, waited, waited..after 1 hour we asked for manager...They finally brought food like 1p min later. The manager was nice, took 25% off..gave us coupons for next time but we won't be back. Our server gave us tude when she brought bill and upon our leaving. I normally do not complain but although the food is supposed to be part of Nashville's finest, the management here is severely lacking to keep up with demand. Tgey also should afford air condition. We finally got to our hotel pool at our $400 a night hotel at 3p because of this place. Thanks Milk & Honey for ruining a huge part of our Nashville vacation.",

He proceeded to be curt with is throughout the duration of our meals. Never once were we offered refills on drinks, our plates were not cleared upon finishing and one of my colleagues had to ask for a takeout container 3 times. To top it off the cashier was taking phone orders, seating guests and ringing up the checks at the same time.

The window by table looks like two year olds rubbed their dirty hands all over it.   Our waitress attire looks like she never washes it...by the way she's served us before with dirty clothing so it's her mojo.  The first two sushi's were okay but something seemed to be lacking in taste and the presentation was... nothing...usually sushi is presented quite beautifully.  \nBut we ate it and wondered if we were ruined since we had sushi at a new place in Murfreesboro that was over the TOP delicious and fresh.   So we went on and ordered a third sushi.   The waitress served us the third sushi with the oddest hesitation...the sushi looked awful.  The menu never said the seaweed paper was on the outside.  It said it was served with avocado and one tiny piece of avocado was on ONE slice.  It was suppose to have Roe and it was nowhere to be found.  So we got the menu and proceeded to complain to the waitress as we felt it wasn't clearly explained what we were getting.  I honestly now wonder if the other two sushi's were even prepared correctly.   I had tasted one bite of the scallops sprinkled over the top and it was sooooooo dried out and disgusting.   My husband tried a slice of the roll.  He doesn't like seaweed on the outside to begin with but he said he's had better at the grocery stores (which is usually very bad).  So that's how low this place has gone.   Fulin's need a serious makeover and management that wants to serve good food.   You've lost two customers.",

    "text": "I do not recommend. Walking in we were not greeted asked only \"how many\". The customer service was horrible. Forgot drink orders. Was mopping the floor 2 hrs prior to close all around all the people that were eating. My opinion  I don't like to eat and smell bleach all around me.  The food was OK but no one came to ask how anything was or follow up. I would not go back",

    "text": "I have stopped by a few times since moving into Rittenhouse Square looking for a friendly pub. In my first two visits during the Spring, the bartenders were nice, friendly and welcoming. This past Fall and Winter, the staff made me feel like an imposition. They were more content sitting/standing on the side of the bar talking about their days and nights and, dare I mention, making fun of customers rather than acknowledging paying attention to the bar of customers. One gentlemen had to ask numerous times to pay his tab (it was not busy). This was my last try at The Black Sheep and will stay with Twenty Manning Grill.",
