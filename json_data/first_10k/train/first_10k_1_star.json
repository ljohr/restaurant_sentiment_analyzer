My online order did not go through and this was very disappointing, they made me stand in line again and re-order my food and did not offer me any type of discount or compensation for this disservice. I asked to speak to the manager who also did not offer me any kind of compensation. They don't seem to care about customer satisfaction instead they were fine with the fact that my online order did not go through. So if you're reading this Panera please take into account that you should work to satisfy your customers. We order online because we have small kids",

    "text": "So we know we have many options out there when it comes to dining out. So tonight the kids wanted steak. We are from out of town, here for part business and part pleasure. \nCalled ahead seating, time was about 20-30mins, perfect, no problem. We arrived and waited for maybe 5 mins in the lobby. So far so good. There was 5 of us, so they put us in a booth that fits 4 ppl, and added a chair at the end. Cool, no big deal. Server, Stefanie came by, took drink order, came back and we were ready to order our food. So we did. She was very tentative, we never had to ask for a refill, not even once. That's good service right there. I will give credit where credit is deserved. So, we all decided on having steak tonight. Two youngest wants steak bites, med cooked, oldest daughter wants hers med rare, my ribeye med, and husbands prime rib medium. \nAfter 30 mins, 8:30 server says she doesn't understand why our food hasn't come out yet she will check, cool. Still no food. Food finally came out steak bites were cold. Matter of fact EVERYTHING WAS COLD. Ok, so food sat in the window. Got someone by the name of Jamie, guest relation guy and told him our food is cold, he apologized and took food to kitchen for recook. He said he would personally see it that they cook it right, HE NEVER RETURN TO OUR TABLE. Time goes by, veru slowly, watching every other table who came in same with us or even after us get their food. So we wait, about 9:25, the remake came out, ran by the SERVICE MANAGER, JODI. This was the first time that she ever came to us. Brought food, had the nerve to ask \" how are you doing\" I replied with angry and hungry, she had no apologies, NOTHING. Food still was not hot, two younger kids food was still well done. I even had Jodi touch the steak bites with her finger, and asked her if it was cold or hot. She said herself that it was cold. I asked her would she have let her kids eat that??? She couldn't answer me. At this point I'm pretty frustrated. She said what would I like for her to do. I SAID, IT WOULD BE NICE TO HAVE THE KITCHEN RECOOK IT STAT, SINCE WE HAVE BEEN WAITING SINCE 8PM. As a service manager or any kind of manager, she should be embarrassed to run the food out without looking at the ticket seeing that it was all supposed to be medium cooked. She could not, would not , do anything to keep me from being so angry, and so disappointed because we have never had a problem with any Texas roadhouse before. \nSo I told her to take the damn food away, and the kitchen manager AJ came out. I asked her to sit next to me and I explained what was going on to her. She seems to understand , but didnt know what to do. I told her, i want the owners business card, and some kind of compensation for being there almost 2 damn hours and my kids were hungry. They were very patience and to the end, still did not have dinner. \nHere's how I would handle the situation. As a sserver I would tell the manager immediately that the food is taking long. Then when food came out make sure manager would come by and check on guests. That never happened. So when food is sent back, manager needs to be aware IMMEDIATELY. And food will be recooked immediately, STAT, and go out to the table and apologize. That was not done at all. Instead she comes out , so unprofessional, and made situation even worse. \nSo i have NEVER been so angry ever at any restaurants. If i was the owner, I would call the guest back asap, and see how to get the guest back and give their restaurant another chance. I got the business card and did call Mr. Michael (owner) we'll see if he returns the call. \nIn the end AJ did get an approval from her owner over the phone to give us a certificate to return for two free meals for 2 adults. I wouldn't want to come back unless I get an invite from the owners and on the day they work to ensure that this does not happened again. So again we'll see if they will reach out to their guest concerns. \nOvtall, i wouldnt give this restaurant any stars for the food service, but for the server she was good. She still should have checked on her tables food and made sure it didn't just in the window. But she was busy, i guess I can understand.\n\nVery poor guest relation from service manager Jodi and Jamie never came back to check on us. \n\nIn the end, had to go else where at 10pm to get food for kids. I'm still pretty upset and frustrated with this restaurant. \n\nYou have many options when dining out, please do not go here.....EVER. CHECK RATINGS AND FIND ANOTHER TEXAS ROADHOUSE.",

This is the second time I've been to this KFC and the last time I attempt to give them business. One the first occasion they told me my meal would take about 20 mins to complete and all I ordered was a 8 piece with 2 sides? No courtesy offered no alternatives asked. But today tops the cake, I ordered 2 Famous Bowls, after them telling me their brand new loaded bowl which is the main reason I came they didn't have, so I settled for normal bowls. But was told they would take about 15 mins which kinda took me by HUGE surprise. And in the process of me thinking wether to wait or not the gentleman behind the mic says \"well is you waiting or not??\" I just pulled off, never will be back.",

    "text": "Very poor quality as a hotel restaurant.  \nWe eat at a hotel restaurant even its food is mediocre and everything is overpriced, because we expect to be treated really nicely by well trained staff.  Well, the experience at this hotel restaurant was very unique.  We (five of us) stayed at the Hotel Monaco to celebrate my birthday, and reserved Red Owl Tavern based on many good reviews.  When we arrived at the tavern, we were taken to a table for four.  We told the gentleman that we were a party of five and we had a reservation.  He told us that he would bring a chair.  So, one of us sat on a chair that was placed in an aisle.  We then saw the area in the back where a group of five or so just left.  So we asked if we could move there.  The waitress told us that those tables were reserved.  I told her that we too \"reserved\" a table for five not four, and it was my birthday.  She told me that she would \"see what she could do.\"  Soon, a lady came to our table and said, \"Those tables are reserved.\"  I told her that we had made a reservation for five.  She said, \"Sorry, this is only what we have\" and patted on my shoulder and left.  My husband was upset, but I said it was OK.  I decided not to let this ruin my birthday.  After that, however, few things went right. They brought pasta with cheese even though I asked the waitress no cheese due to my daughter's allergy.  So, my very hungry daughter had to wait another 20 minutes for her pasta with no cheese.  We had to ask why the bread, the side, and my father's dish were so late when other dishes were already at the table.  When the bread came after a long wait, it had butter on it despite the fact we told the waitress my daughter was allergic to dairy.  My 81 year old father's dish (Caesar salad with chicken) finally came after everyone finished their food which was more than an hour after we ordered all the food.  While all these things happening, we saw the area we had hoped to move in order to have more room which was \"reserved\" completely empty.  Toward the end of the meal, a couple of people were seated at one of the empty tables.  Our waitress was very apologetic.  She was never rude.  She took the pasta, Caesar salad, bread, off the bill, which was nice.  Would I like to dine at Red Owl Tavern again to deal with all the stress, especially for a special occasion like a birthday?  Absolutely not.  I hope the general manager of the Hotel Monaco (Mr. James Adamson) will make more effort to train people at the restaurant at the Hotel.",

If I want freezer food, I'll cook from my freezer at home(not that I have frozen wings or anything like that). Anyways they aren't worth the money spent and most of the people are rude and enjoyed their cell phones too much while people waited and waited and waited for drink refills.

    "text": "Ordered a chicken gyro, a beef gyro, and grape leaves.\n\nIt took an hour and a half to arrive.  I live 0.9 miles away from Smiley's Cafe.  \n\nMy boyfriend was handed a sopping wet brown bag of what was assumed to contain a charming dinner for 2 straight from the Balkan tip, but could have been mistaken for a bum's malt liquor koozie.\n\nThis meal forced me to review the definition of 'gyro'  (i.e. A gyro [iro] or gyros [iros][note 1] (Greek: , gyros, literally 'turn') is a Greek dish made of meat cooked on a vertical rotisserie).  The meat in the gyros was bland, dry, cold, and quite obviously not cooked on a spit.  The chicken tasted and looked like it was boiled in water.  The beef had noticeable bits of synthesized Mediterranean flavor, but ultimately dry, downcast, overworked and underpaid.  Sloppily assembled.  I drenched sriracha and mayo on everything to find my stomach's way to salvation.\n\nGrape leaves were fine, though I was resentful of them due to their little olive oil orgy they decided to have all over everything.\n\nShit happens, I get it.  I guess I just want the restaurant/delivery driver to at least feign recognition by saying, \"yo, that took a long time!  sorry, my man!\" or \"ay, got a nondescript liquid peeking out your bag.  my b.\"  Complete lack of acknowledgement or a whisper of an apology just kills me.",

Either we caught the place on an off-night or the management has really taken a poor turn.  At the ordering area, the food obviously did not look fresh; it appeared to have been sitting there for many hours unrefrigerated before our arrival.  I hesitated but ordered a veggie pizza for myself and he ordered a hawaiian pizza.  It took nearly 20 minutes for our food to arrive, even though there were very few people in the restaurant.  When our food was finally \"ready\" it was cold and soggy (even though the pizza had ostensibly been warmed up).  It was the worst pizza I have ever had from anywhere in town.  Total disappointment.  I won't be returning.  Go to Frog next door instead.",

    "text": "Went for brunch today. Nice atmosphere with jazz band playing which was really cool and the gentlemen playing were talented. Food was mediocre at best and for the price I'd say was a major letdown. We had the duck spring rolls which were okay but at 7 dollars per roll left much to be desired. The bbq shrimp were okay and again for nearly $25 again left much to be desired. The eggs and bacon were decent. Two bloody Mary's were watered down and bland. The one star review is reflected by the service. We had some of the most inattentive service in NOLA (in about 10 trips over the past 5 years) and that's saying a lot as things here move at a much slower pace in general. Forgot coffee order, forgot Bloody drink order, no coffee refill, no follow up whatsoever from our waitress on anything and had to ask for literally every single item needed including utensils. The closest thing to a modicum of service I had was from the water guys. Walked out with $100 check for brunch and a feeling that they could care less about us as a customer. Also I should have known going in when I saw the host berate a more junior team member to nearly tears for supposedly mishandling customer checkin. Unfortunately they can likely get away with it because the place was packed.......sorry Mr. B but we won't be returning or recommending you.",

    "text": "We have been to Zydeco's several times over the last four years and the experience has been on a slow decline.  At this point, we will not return.\nOn our visit before the most recent one, we discovered that they had gotten rid of the (really awesome) nightly specials and replaced those with a fried buffet.  There are some items that are not fried, but primarily that is the case.  Not a bad idea it seemed, but the price was 28.99 and 15.95 for children.  We gave it a shot and it wasn't too bad, but still we found the price rather steep.\nThis most recent visit, we discovered the price had gone up to 29.99.  Still willing to give it a chance, we got seated.  We ordered our drinks and three buffets, along with one dozen chargrilled oysters, as they are not on the buffet.\nAfter we received our drinks and started on the buffet, my husband had to remind the waitress that salads were included with the buffet, which she then brought.  Near the end of our first round of fried foods, half a dozen oysters arrived.  Not being terribly anxious to wait another 20 minutes for the rest of the oysters, we did not say anything about it.\nThe buffet:  It would seem that most of the food had been out there for quite some time.  The restaurant was not very crowded at all, so we understood why there might be some items that needed refreshing, but nearly all of the food on the buffet was rubbery and old.  When the server returned and asked us how everything was, we shared that detail with her and she said a half-hearted \"sorry\" and said that \"they can drop some more, if you want?\".  The reasons we declined this offer are numerous.  One - twice we had to get up and ask the hostess or another server to please locate our server, as we hadn't seen her  in a significant enough amount of time, so we didn't have a whole lot of faith in her expediency.  Two - almost everything on the buffet needed replacing, how long would we expect that to take after we'd already been there near an hour?  And three - I don't feel that the customer should be asked if they would like fresh food, it's awkward and inappropriate.\nWe decided to go ahead and get the check, but unsurprisingly, our server was absent again.  We again approached the hostess area and asked if she could please find our server.  She asked who that was and we were unable to answer, as she never told us her name.\nShortly, a different server came and delivered our bill.  We prepared our payment and waited.  And waited.  Finally, our original server returned to ask if the other girl had come and gotten our check yet!  We replied no, and she WALKED AWAY.\nWe had \"frequent buffet\" cards from a previous visit that we did not bother to get stamped, as we will not be returning.",

First when I ordered the cupcakes I asked if they did a strawberry shortcake kind of cupcake ( this was for my sisters bday and she celiac and pregnant) cause that's what my sister loves and the girl said yes. I asked if the cupcake would have real strawberries in it and on top of it and she said yes! So I ordered them. I picked up the cupcakes 2 days later and as I walked in to get my cupcakes there were 3 people standing behind the counter talking and NO ONE acknowledged me. I had to say something to get someone to help me. I get the cupcakes and they look ok.. I figured the strawberries were on top as well the inside like the girl said but I didn't see any on top. Ok so I leave and when it's time to serve the cupcakes after dinner, we cut the cupcakes in half for everyone to try and just as I thought NO strawberries. Then everyone takes a bite and spits the cupcakes out all at the same time. It was crazy. The cupcakes tasted HORRIBLE!!!! I couldn't believe it. \nSo I tried to call and speak to a manager and she wasn't there. The employee had no clue when the mgr would come in. So I called for 4 days straight and still no mgr was around to help me. They didn't even know her last name or any other way to contact her. I was furious. This place is terrible. When I saw the bad reviews I still took a chance to try them out. Well I guess I should of went with the reviews. I will NEVER COME BACK TO THIS PLACE AGAIN.

The floors were also incredibly slippery and hard to walk on. When I placed my order, it was written down, however, three things didn't come at all. The sushi is low quality. They use entirely too much rice, and the fish does not taste or smell fresh. I couldn't eat it. The cooked food was not awful, but was not worth getting.

Plus our roast beef sammy was way overcooked and dry... and missing the \"everything\" we asked for (lettuce, onion, pickle, tomato, mayo).\n\nSo we called back and explained the situation and they promised to send the remake out RIGHT AWAY. lol.... another hour later we got a nice looking roast beef sammy but a pizza that was even MORE jacked! There was not a single topping even hinged on the the crust of the pizza.\n\nWe called back again laughing. I said, \"I am not even mad, I am impressed. Let me send you a text image of this pizza- it is crazy.\" He apologized profusely and promised to send another, but at this point it had been 2 hours and we had drank our sodas, and eaten our wings and had dinner plans so we refused another pizza. \n\nAt this point, the gentleman offered to bring us back our ten dolllars for the pizza and we accepted. He said he'd be by shortly but it was another hour before we saw him.\n\nTotal s-show. Avoid this location altogether. I have had far superior service at the U City or Maplewood locations. YIKES",

Last time I was very disappointing with a chef that couldn't cook and had no personality. Was advised to ask for Steve and so we did. First, not an ideal table, with all homecoming kids- not the smartest seating by the host as they were dispersed through the house and each table had them and 1 couple. But, frankly the food was just ok as was Steve. Don't know what happened to the chefs that made dining there fun and delicious, like Chris. Chris where are you  now? Although they deny a change in management or organization there are many changes, not for the best which includes the tedious serving of soup and salad at the table by the server resulting in smaller portions and time consuming, smaller dinner portions and the food quality seems to have gone down as well. The good news, definitely not as crowded!",

Their website which is fairly useless if you want to figure out the menu before going, you have to pick your location choice out of 3 locations and then drill down to the bottom to see the weak descriptions of their menu offering, no explanations and no price, just this\n\n    Roast Beef\n    Roast Beef Combo\n    Roast Pork\n    Roast Pork Combo\n    Baked Ham\n    Baked Ham Combo\n    Roast Turkey\n    Roast Turkey Combo\n    Broccoli Rabe\n    Broccoli Rabe Combo\n\n\nNo explanation of whats in a combo (its just where they add cheese by the way)\n\nThe table placecard (instead of menu) had a more detailed description than the website.  \n\nWhen I walked in, its more bar than restaurant, no big deal, but there were tables.  Since I couldnt decide and the sandwiches werent too expensive at $6.85, I got the roast beef and roast port combos.\n\nI got my two sandwiches fast enough, but the roast beef was cold and the roast pork was hot.  Not sure how a cook (for lack of a better word) could serve 2 things at the same time with such a temperature differential, one was obviously sitting for awhile.  I asked the waitress to reheat the roast beef while I finished the roast pork, and supposedly it was reheated, since it was warmer, but it was still cold-ish compared to my roast pork I had just finished.  The waitress did offer to replace it when she inquired, but I was in a hurry and didnt really care for a hot version of this sandwich.\n\nThe sandwiches were very skimpy on meat, but they \"made up for it\" by adding too much gravy to make it overly messy and the bread was disintegrating.  The menu place card mentions the \"wet meat\" option where you get less gravy, I strongly recommend you get it that style, especially if the gravy overpower the meat and structural integrity of the sandwich.",

They didn't give us any of those flavors to try either, but a chocolate cupcake was available for purchase (why thank you!) the vanilla we took a chance on (it's vanilla). They also kept telling me that most everything would be \"over our budget\". Idk a budget of $300 for a cake for about 25 people doesn't seem cheap \u200d-  (granted we aren't Beyonc\u00e9's crew!) Also, our event was early December and the manager didn't return my correspondence promptly, and when she did get back to me, her excuse was that they were so busy with thanksgiving pies (I feel valued!) We decided to go here because of reviews, their cupcake wars win, and to support a new(ish) Philly bakery, and, by the time we figured out that it wasn't panning out to be a good experience it was too late to change bakeries. But, if I could do it all over again, I would find a place that appreciated us, our money, time and occasion; hope this helps you do the same- unless you're Beyonc\u00e9 then you're all good ;)",

I ordered a classic grilled cheese sandwich, which is supposed to contain - you guessed it - just cheese. However, some of the staff members seemed distracted while they were making it. I didn't think anything of it until I got in my car and started chowing down. I thought it was odd that the sandwich tasted spicy (like, reeeeeally hot spicy) but I was SO hungry, so I kept eating half of it. Then I tasted something funny. When I opened up my sandwich, I saw turkey. Now, for most people this would not be a big deal, but for me, I've been a strict vegetarian since I was a kid, and meat makes me really sick, so it was a big freakin' deal. Made me throw up. Now I'm grossed out and sad because I used to love 'feine, but am now really disappointed - they should have been more careful. Turkey wasn't even on the grilled cheese menu, so I'm really confused as to how it got into my sandwich. Ughhh.",

The 1 Star is for the kind people that waited on me.",

Its been some time since I have frequented this restaurant, I stopped going for sometime because the food became very inconsistent.\n\nFast forward to today, i decided to stop by since some years had passed.  I ordered the ox tail and jerk chicken wings...  I just have to say that i was VERY disappointed. The oxtail though tender was very small and full of fat... more fat than meat and small portions at that...the rice was stale.  But what was really disappointing was the jerk wings.. I took one bite and ended up spitting out the chicken..  I just couldn't believe that an establishment would serve this....i assume no one in the kitchen samples the food before it comes out... they just cant... there is no way someone could think its okay to serve such dry tasteless food.  I was right to stay away for years, and i will be doing so again...",

I expected great food to come out and what I got was frozen seafood!!! Ordered the calamari- looked great but tasted like frozen fried with no season at all!! Kids got chicken fingers and a burger which also taste frozen and the burger no joke tasted just like a frozen bubba burger you get from the store. Also got the Mango Mai Mai, this I thought for sure would be good but again the fresh was rubbery, over cooked tasted frozen, the baked potato tasted to be old. When it came time to pay, i have my server a $100 bill she brings me back change for a $50! Not cool at all! In all honesty the only thing this place is good for is drinks. I'm very disappointed in it ! I should have saved the money and walked over to Crabby Bills!",

    "text": "oh Millers, how i wanted to like you.  You are close to my house, have ample parking, and large spacious tables.  you even have a fireplace in the back for a little ambiance. \n\nfriends and i tried to come here 2 or 3 times for a quick/inexpensive* bite to eat and every time there was a 30-60 minute wait. we thought this must mean they are really good.  perhaps it just means that people in Springfield are willing to settle for a less than average dining experience.  *side note- this place is not inexpensive. \n\nhubby and i ordered apps- he got zinger boneless wings, and i got the guacamole. portion size was ENORMOUS on the guac - it could have served 8 people, seriously.  flavor was meh. apparently the wingz were good.  hard to tell what hubby enjoyed more, the wingz or the scantily dressed hostesses. \n\nour server was great, attentive and pleasant.  When something went wrong she did her best to fix it. That was much appreciated.   Side salad came out wilted and gross. management offered to take it off the check, would have rather had a decent salad in the first place but i digress.  Dinner was not very flavorful - at all - and portion sizes were okay. i got the quesadilla appetizer (which was plenty for an entree) but it was very sloppily put together and had no seasoning at all.  I have had food that is presented better and tastes better at fast food restaurants, where i am happy to pay $5 for a meal.  \n\nAt the end of the meal, i badly wanted dessert but didnt want to risk another poorly flavored dish.  Not to mention, all the dishes were like lunch tray plastic, and i felt that a $50-60 dinner for two was at least worth a nicer presentation. who knows, it may have even made up for the bland flavors. \n\nperhaps i was let down by the fact that there always seemed to be a wait and i had over hyped it in my head.  Never have i wanted to send back everything i ordered at a restaurant before this night.  i will never be back.  my husband says he will order the wings, but takeout only. no more dining in at this place.",

We explained this to Dorothy the hostess, she took us to a table directly under the overhead lighting.  We again asked if we could be seated at a different table, (the restaurant was not crowded, plenty of tables were available). She snapped back at us  \"this is only a restaurant\"..... excuse me.... I couldn't believe how rude she was.  She snatched the menus off the table and walked away, we found our own table.  So Cracker Barrel obviously does not make it clear to their employees to 1) the customer is important. 2) It is ILLEGAL to mistreat those with disabilities.  \n\nGo if you wish, but look out for rude hostess --- Dorothy!",

I haven't ordered anything ridiculous or out of the ordinary, yet here I am. If I didn't already pay for the food or had any confidence in their ability to refund me, I would leave and go elsewhere. I haven't been assured that my food is coming soon, had anyone apologize to me for the wait, or even acknowledge my existence. It's now been 44 minutes since I first sat down and I am being nodded at. I guess that means my order is ready. I'll update this review when I actually get to eat the food.",

    "text": "We have always enjoyed this restaurant and the entire dinning experience. Last night was an example of how one individual can ruin the evening. When we had an issue with the To-Go order the manager basically told me to pound sand. We dinned in and at the time of seating ordered an entree to take home with the expectation it would be ready when we were finished. Unfortunately that was not the case and I was told when I received my bill that it would be an additional fifteen minutes before my take home order was ready because the kitchen was backed up. When I expressed my disappointment to the waiter, she sent Nanu, the manager over to speak with me. Nanu was not apologetic, did not offer concern and was certainly not  making my satisfaction his priority. I asked him to at least offer the entree to me for half price. He brought back my bill, said he charged me half for my take home order and quickly walked off. When I was leaving he was standing at the front, I told him that his actions were not acceptable and He was obviously not focused on customer service. His response was \"call corporate\". Wow, don't think I will be visiting this restaurant again. Management certainly does not care about the customer experience.",

This McDonald's is in for big trouble if another business ever comes out here!  \n\nToday we went inside because being the 4th of July, the Queen Donuts was closed.  We just wanted a quick breakfast. \n\nThe food is standard McDonald's fare, usually the iced coffee is what I stop for.  It can be really good.  Today they put so much vanilla in it - it was white.  A bit (!) too sweet today.\n\nPlease note that fast food is not fast at this McDonald's.   I don't even know why.  There were 8 people working (that I could see).  Maybe there is a more efficient way they could do things?  Seems like 8 would be enough....but I have never worked in a restaurant,  so I don't know if 8 is enough!\n\nIt gets 1 star for being here when you are desperate!",

After an extremely long wait to be seated as usual, your told 15minutes that could easily turn into an hour and that's just the appetizer. My girlfriend and I are finally  seated, and I notice the waitress is giving my girlfriend plenty of eye contact as we place our order and giving me very little to none  like I was  a freakin ghost very unprofessional and I'm thinking\" what's up with that\" this is the first course. Right now already not feeling this place. Anyway, I ordered the jerk wings with the waffles. HORRIBLE ass salty caked on jerk like paste they use for the wings the waffles were good but those wings could've found more of a home in the trash. That was the icing on the cake for me. Had to even ask for more napkins from the waitress as she proceeded to look as she was rationing them out. They give you one silly paper napkin and I guess that supposed to hold you. At the end of our luxurious meal I told the waitress the wings are way too salty, she looked disappointed as if she personally made them. She asked if I wanted something else \"right know I'm really disgusted \" I said no just bring the check. My girlfriend said she would take them and maybe scrape some of the brine off they should be okay.What ever.... The waitress still looking like she was very disappointed. Oh well.... I see why Gordon Ramsey stays so angry at some of these restaurants. Because they really don't know what they are doing.If people are so hyped about this place I want to know what they are ordering please post. Maybe the cook didn't feel like cooking today.

Well I can live with that if the quality of food is good.

Any of the vegetables in any of the dishes including lo-mein weren't fresh. There was no flavor to any of the dishes, no spices, not even salted properly.

He only said \"you ready to order?\" After two of us ordered, one friend started placing her sushi order but was deciding between two rolls. The waiter literally ran off in the middle of her speaking and said \"be back! Let me get somebody else's drink. Every minute counts!\". We were baffled at this. In addition, for myself and another friend, our food was much spicier than we requested. He gave us an attitude & then sent somebody else over to the table to assist.

I ordered a breakfast sandwich, which we had to wait for because the kitchen gave away the first one and tried to give the second one away until our waitress caught it. \n\nMy sandwich was okay, but I did notice the bread had mold on it which we quietly brought to our server's attention. She was very apologetic and brought it to the kitchen. She then came back out and explained the chef said it was from cutting spinach for the Eggs Florentine we had ordered. The spot was no where near where the bread had been sliced, and the color was more blue than green. It took a brief discussion with our server to have the sandwich removed from the check. So they're either cross contaminating the knives they're using or they're trying to serve their customers mold. We also never received the grits we ordered which they removed with no issue. \n\nJessica the waitress was very apologetic the whole time, and very sweet. The kitchen staff should be ashamed.",

    "text": "This hotel was so terrible and I can narrow it down to 4 things:\n\n1. The price: Expect to pay a lot of money from the second you arrive. They charge $35 per person for a round trip shuttle ride to the airport. Our room was roughly $275 a night. It's an incredibly large hotel that offers a nail salon, a Godiva Chocolate store, about 9 restaurants and a few bars. But you'll pay dearly for any of those things - like $2.50 for a small bottle of soda. The hotel is designed to keep you in there and they charge you $15 for a round trip shuttle ride to the downtown Nashville area. \n\n2. The service: We called the front desk and were on hold for 20 minutes. We went to the front desk and waited in line for an hour. We waited around to ask the concierge questions. And each time we got, \"I don't know\" as the usual response. The cleaning staff was extraordinarily loud and they actually shouted as they went down the hall at 6:30 a.m.\n\n3. The name: They call this place a resort but that is, by far, a misnomer. This place is a convention hotel, period. It's horrifically loud at all hours of the day because they host about 3 conventions at one time. Our windows faced one of the courtyards and there is music pumping there 24 hours a day. The walls are thin and you can hear *everything* happening in the neighboring rooms. (eww!) If you want to relax at a resort, don't stay here because with all those convention people, loud cleaning staff, 24 hour music and thin walls you will only end up with more stress.\n\n4. The size: It's no joke that you will get lost in this hotel. It's inexplicably large. And when it hits noon, you should already be in one of the few restaurants because they fill up FAST. With several conventions happening at one time, getting a \"quick bite\" is not possible here. And there's not really any place close by, either. You can walk over to the mall for some fast food but plan enough time for your walk - getting out of the hotel takes at least 5 minutes.\n\nI'm sure glad I was there for a convention and didn't pay out of my own pocket for this ridiculous hotel.",

We walked in and stood at the hostess stand for over 5 minutes while the hostess remained on the phone without even acknowledging us.  We were seated and then it took an additional 12 minutes for a server to come to our table.  We both ordered hibachi dinners and were extremely disappointed.  The soup tasted like dish water and our entrees were served at room temperature (at best).   The waiter gave most of his attention to the hibachi tables, and walked by us with an \"Oh Crap!  I forgot their food\" look.  Granted, it looked like he was one of only two servers working a nearly full restaurant.  He was very nice to us when we brought up how unsatisfactory the food was.  At $15 for an entree, it should be served hot.  Right?  He apologized and offered to have the kitchen make us new meals, but we had already been there over an hour and could not wait through that process again.  We ate the remainder of our meals, and were really not surprised when we got the check and no discount whatsoever was there to at least attempt to make amends for our awful experience.

I travel for a living and have eaten at Mellow Mushroom all over the country, the Brandon location has a different taste and look than anywhere else. It is always very sparse with the toppings, compared with all the other locations.  When you have four different toppings on a pizza and can take 2 to 3 bites without biting into any ingredient, then something is wrong! The jerk chicken barely has any spice on it,  to the point where you can't even taste the spice. The last three times I have gone they have completely gotten the order wrong. The last time was for my birthday and we live an hour away. When they got it wrong the waitress very reluctantly took it back and have them fix another one. It's like she made me feel guilty for them messing it up. Then I went today on the way home, and they didn't put the sun-dried tomato on it. The clock actually argued with me that it was on there when I told him to pointed out, he said it was under the cheese. So I then proceeded to peel all the cheese back and it was not there. He again gave me attitude for putting on something that I had already paid for. I am convinced that the owner of this location purposely scrimps on the ingredients to save money. On top of that customer service is terrible to the point where I don't even feel like ever coming back. And that says a lot for my favorite pizza.",

Hotel Across the Street Fairfield Inn, wanted dinner before checking in decided Denny's would be perfect.\n\nThis Denny needs help, Gentleman sat me and my Family down and told us someone would be with is shortly. Almost 15 minutes later no one came over, I saw a female one Table away as she dropped off items but then she scooted away. I saw a Family arrive, and the Waiter that sat us down help this family, taking their order and bringing them drinks.\n\nI told my Family let's go, I know we are tired and hungry but they don't value our business. As we got up, all 8 of us one even made an attempt to perhaps stop us even acknowledge us. \n\nSo sad... We ended up at Wendy's\n\nIf you don't change your ways, Travelers wi ll write you up for poor Service and eventually you business will fail.\n\nI might even Contact Denny's Corporate to share my Experience. You accross the street from Major Hotels.\n\nThink about changing or sell the place to someone who cares.",

    "text": "How can something so simple become so hard? \n\nDucked into Mr. B's for a quick lunch at the bar. I ordered a Mr. B's luncheon salad (dressing on the side) and a catfish fingers app. The salad came WITH dressing; the overly loquacious bartender was at the far end of the bar, regaling diners there with the tale of his losing another customer's credit card earlier in the day, and despite my efforts, I was unable to get his attention. So, I ate the dressed salad. Twenty minutes later, the bartender finally came by, and asked if I had received the catfish fingers. I had not.\n\nThe bartender ducked into the kitchen, came back, and assured me that a fresh order of catfish was being made for me. Waited (in vain) for another 30 minutes. When I had been waiting a total of 50 minutes and had still not received my food, I asked for a check (minus the catfish) and a manager. The manager heard my story and professed to be astounded, and he assured me he was going to investigate in the kitchen as to what went wrong. Then he jumped up and left.\n\nAnytime that I've experienced a restaurant malfunction of this magnitude, I've been offered some measure of hospitality. Neither the bartender nor the manager cared enough to offer me a drink, a dessert, or any other compensation for the time I wasted trying to have a simple lunch. What a supreme disappointment from what I thought was a high caliber operation.",

If you are going to call yourself a Japanese restaurant, at least take cooking lessons or something.\n\nSecond, the rice in the numerous rolls we ordered was overcooked goo, and not vinegared. The low quality soy sauce that came with the sushi was mixed with water - utterly vile.\n\nWe also ordered tempura, which was basically an oily, greasy mess - basically deep fried assorted vegetables. \n\nWe ended up throwing everything away and cooking our own dinner. It really was that disgusting.",

Although the food was good, the waitress was horrible We first ordered 1 soda   and 1 ice tea, and 2 waters she didn't bring us the water for another 15 minutes after we got the soda and ice tea.\n\nWhen we asked for 2 minutes-, that turned into 16 minutes We actually had to wave down the Hostess and ask where our waitress went so we could order. When  the host asked the manager where she was, he got her. The waitress came over to take our order Nothing- not even an apology or smile.. Not a \"Sorry for the wait\"\n\nWe ordered the Zuccini Frities, Chicken,Veal Parm. Food was all good. Bread was good.  We order the small portions. she screwed up the order- She brought us the regular sized ones. I made sure she didn't charge us for the regular ones - She in fact did and didn't take it off till the last moment- probably trying to sneak it by us hoping we wouldn't see so she would get a bigger tip.\n\nShe never came over and asked how our meal was. she never looked over to our table ONCE.After i got my meal i needed a drink refill. once again she disappeared for almost 15 minutes\n\nIt was around 3pm on a Sunday- there were plenty of servers, waitresses on the floor that night The restaurant was NOT packed. There was NO wait for our table when we arrived.And it it wasn't dinner hour yet. Our waitress appeared to be working only 4 tables in total.If it was any other restaurant That waitress would be catering to our every needs quickly and professionally with a smile on their face.\n\nI have been to many restaurants and 90% of them have better service than this.\n\nThe food was good but I would rather stay at home than deal with this sub par and rude service.\n\nShe messed up the order was late with the drinks, never apologized and disappeared alot \n\nTrust me guys, go to a better class area than Springfield or dont be surprised if you walk away disappointed with the service.",

The service industry is such a huge part of New Orleans, I've got nothing but admiration for the patience and hard work of servers. I had such a bad server experience at Backspace- it was bizarre, and seemed purposely directed, so much so that an acquaintance of mine also seated at the bar stepped in to call it out. \n\nAfter working 50 hours in 3 days at my Conference, I was super stoked to get a burger and a beer here after reading all the great reviews. Bellied up to the bar, asked for a menu, and ordered an Amber. It came in a plastic cup, which was the first strike when obviously dining in.  Then when I got my food, the bartender talked loudly about his bowel movements in front of me while I was eating, and joked about doing so. And here's when bad service felt like it was being done purposefully, I'm not a naive diner. My friend seated nearby comes to Backspace whenever he's in town, and called the server out (that's how obviously gauche the service was). \n\nNew Orleans is great for its choices when going out, and I'm happy to Yelp about those great experiences, and spend my dollars elsewhere.",

They were out of EVERYTHING when we arrived, which made me assume my food would be tasty. The black eyed peas tasted like they were just boiled. Had something weird looking in it maybe bacon, but absolutely no flavor. Cabbage was the same, just boiled. Not exactly sure why we had to wait 20 minutes for food that they popped in the microwave. I'm assuming at one point over the years they served cornbread, well no longer. My bf got fried fish and chicken; it all tasted like flour. The mac and cheese was super dry and burnt, and tasted like boiled noodles nothing else. Sweet potatoes are definitely from a can, probably why they taste so good in comparison to everything else. We only went here because we had a free gift card. STILL wound up spending like 20 bucks. Wasn't worth the drive we made half way across the city. And having to listen to the cook curse and complain about working there made those 20 minutes seem even less fruitful. Definitely won't be back.",

    "text": "I've had some great Ethiopian food but this place was the worst ever, very disappointing and overpriced!\n\nThe service was very slow and the waitress spent most of the time chatting with her fellow employees and essentially ignoring us.  \n\nThe menu was misleading - it lists a combo of \"all vegetables\" for $15, but really you just get 8 items of their choosing - the \"Queen's Eight\" platter.  Our waitress didn't even know this, until I questioned after she only brought us 6 items, and she had to ask someone else.  It seems unfair to charge the exact same price for a vegetarian platter as for one with meat dishes.  \n\nEvery other place I've visited served the combo platter on a big piece of injera spread out on a large plate but here they serve a few (very small) portions of items on a couple of strips of injera.  Their injera was a disgrace!  As some other reviewers have noted, it was slightly dried out and the edges were crusty!  To top it off, the veggie items were maybe lukewarm, at best, and pretty bland for Ethiopian cuisine.  \n\nAs we finished up our meal, I chose to eat a salvageable portion of the injera that had all the juices soaked into it.  Unfortunately hiding underneath it was a long black hair!\n\nNeedless to say, we won't be back!!!",

    "text": "We visited the Ihop on Canal Street after a day of traveling and were seated by a friendly waitress. In our group, there were two adults and four children, ages 14, 13, 5 and 3. The waitress brought our drinks and took our order quite efficiently. When the food arrived, one five-stack of buttermilk pancakes were missing. My daughter had to sit and watch everyone eat for some time, while the waitress made promises each trip past our table. Knowing she was starving, I finally gave her one f my three pancakes so she had something in front of her while she waited.\n\nFinally, her order arrived and she began eating. The waitress left my bill on the table - $54. I had ordered the Colorado Omelette which was quite good but when I finished most of it and started on my pancakes, I got a nasty nasty surprise. With the second bite of my pancakes, something felt wrong in my mouth. I reached in and found a hair. I started pulling it out of my mouth and it kept coming and coming, like a fishing line!!! UGH MY GAWD. The thing took both hands and turned out to be a curly reddish hair. It was not mine nor the waitresses as it had obviously been cooked into the pancake. This made me sick to my stomach, of course.\n\nI called the waitress over and showed her. She quickly told me the hair did not match anyone on duty (WHO CARES ABOUT THAT? THE DAMN THING WAS IN MY FOOD!) She asked me if I wanted to speak to the manager and I said no, please just take this food away from the table. She did not ask me if I wanted a replacement (even though I would have said no, it would have been nice if she had offered). She came back to the table a few minutes later and picked up the $54 check, leaving another in its place. I thought maybe she had took my meal off of the bill but NO - now my total was $63.89. Listed as a service charge was $7.73 - she had included her own gratuity after the hair was found. \n\nIHOP used to be my ultimate favorite restaurant but now it just makes my stomach churn and brings back a memory I cannot erase. I will never, ever return to this restaurant and unless something changes in the future, I will never eat at another IHOP err... IHAIR again!!!  \n\nAnd since when did IHOP start adding gratuity into their checks?????????????????",

The waitress didn't acknowledge us until 15 minutes later and when she finally approached us, instead of apologizing she said we were last on the list that's why she waited this long. Very very bad beginning. We ordered wraps which they were terrible, my chicken wrap had two small pieces of chicken and a lot of lettuce, so basically filled with lettuce only, gross. And the waitress brought one water, and Said \"I only had one clean glass\" really? Is that what you say? \nAnyways, I'm never coming back. I wonder if the owners or managers of this place look at yelp and Facebook reviews? Maybe you should train your servers to be more polite?

Geeze Acme....put someone in this department that can actually perform customer service!\n\nI was actually shocked to see that they had a crown rib roast in the meat department the other day. I didn't think they could do something that complicated. However, I might add, that for an expensive cut of meat as it was, it was horribly wrapped with bones cutting through the plastic wrap.

I had eaten a perfectly acceptible brunch at the original location in Baton Rouge and still had very low expectations...they were not met.\n     The good first: the service was friendfly and efficient.\n     The bad: poor quality chips, including some tasting of rancid oil, were accompanied with pretty good salsa and truly tasteless queso. Seriously, the jar of queso in the grocey is eons better.\n     My lenten crawfish quesedillas were okay, but nothing to write home about and they were probably the tastiest thing to hit our table.\n     My lovely wife had the not at all lovely (to look at...an amalgam of beiges & light browns in amoebic puddles) Rio Grande plate. Bear in mind, Paige is pretty down with standard American-style mexican if it is fresh, but she was pretty underwhelmed.\n     The crowd was mostly tourists (from out of town or Metairie/Slidell, etc from the looks of it) so perhaps the lovely setting helped them ignore the pallid dreck proffered here, but its walking distance location will in no way seduce into another visit.",

It was not completed until 1:00 and at that time the cashier told me she doesn't know how to process a fleet vehicle and would have to wait for a manager. She then said the manager is on a conference call which usually takes about 30 minutes. Poor service and concept of time. I will never be back to this shop and if you cherish the time in your day I suggest you don't either. I would have given them negative stars if it was possible.

Verizon does this intentionally, I believe, to force 3GB users to upgrade to the more expensive 4GB service. Verizon told me that \"4GB service isn't optimized, so you get uninterrupted service.\"  What the tech, in effect, was telling me is that Verizon is intentionally defrauding me of internet service to force me to buy a more expensive service.

Basically if I would return my iPhone 8 to go back down to iPhone 7 then I will get a new iPhone 7 and restart not only the contract, but sadly start at zero again which means the iPhone 7 will cost me $800.  So let me think about this I can return my iPhone 8 and go back to iPhone 7 for $800.  Sounds like a deal right?  At least I could of been informed before making the deal.

    "text": "Sadly, I had a waiter serve me a dinner I was allergic to, despite me (1) telling him I had an allergy; (2) after I placed my order, I asked him to ask the chef whether my choices would be allergy-free; and (3) upon his serving the meal to me, I asked him whether he had asked the chef  whether it was free of the allergy I needed to avoid (dairy) and he told me yes, it was fine. Partly through the meal, I suspected there was butter in it, and when I asked a different waiter, he confirmed that it had butter. They then offered to bring me something else, but the rest of my family had already finished their meals so I said no. Lastly, to add insult to injury, when I asked the waiter why they were charging me for my meal, given that I couldn't eat it, he said that since my son (who does not share my allergy) was taking it home with him, they had to charge for it. \n\nI have been dealing with this allergy for a number of years now, and while it has presented issues at restaurants, never has it been as egregious as this. I went to talk to the ma\u00eetre d', who apologized and removed the item from our bill. But the damage had been done and I am suffering the consequences.\n\nI had been wanting to try this presumably \"elite\" restaurant for many years, and I'm very sorry that I did. Apparently, the waiter thought I said cheese allergy, not dairy. The waiter himself was somewhat disturbing, in that he was sweating the entire time he was serving us, seemed to have laryngitis, and was coughing a bit.",

Either I caught them on a really bad day, or Philadelphia is not the place to get sushi. \n\nThe 'Volcano Bowl' sounded promising - tuna tartare in a bowl of avocado. I've had tuna tartare at many different places, and this was by far the worst. Tartare is supposed to be chunky and juicy from the flavors of soy, lime juice, ginger, etc. What I received was reddish pink paste with zero flavor. \n\nThat was my appetizer, and I knew at that point I had made a mistake coming here instead of trying a burger at Village Whiskey. But I had 2 signature rolls coming so hoped the meal could be salvaged. Nope - the Paris roll was just OK at best, and my 2nd roll (forget the name) wrapped in cucumber was barely edible. \n\nNext time I'm in town I'll stick to cheesesteaks.",

After eating here we'll never go back. \"Mozzarella Fritta\" was literally mozzarella sticks I could have bought at any pizzeria. Chicken parm came out soggy with very little taste. I expected the homemade marinara to have a little more flavor. End result was a bland over-priced meal. Save your money. There are plenty of other Italian options in the city.\n\nBy the way, I no longer trust this relatives restaurant suggestions.\n\nService was below average. Seemed like everyone was stepping over everyone else shoes. I think it was the manager who initially took our order and we could hardly hear what he was saying. The three employees that were in eye-shot of our table were on their cell phones more often than waiting our table. \n\nI know I already said this but it's definitely a point of emphasis... save your money.

Steep!\n\nMy mozzarella sticks tasted awful--wayyy too salty, first of all, and they were just frozen sticks out of a box. There were five of them, so I paid a dollar a stick for frozen crap that was too salty to even eat. I ate one and ended up tossing the rest.\n\nThe shrimp were likewise cooked out of a box of frozen junk, and somehow they had managed to overcook them so they were kind of hard. The shrimp inside were super-small and it was mostly breading. Five shrimp came with soggy, mediocre fries, some bread, a small side salad, and cole slaw. I ate like six fries and by that time I had given up on my meal, so I can't report on the slaw, salad, or bread.\nMy can of soda was not even very cold, so they managed to screw that one up, too.\n\nThis place charges way too much to be serving such crappy food.

After an hour and fifteen minutes I called to ask if their driver had left and the girl's response was \" I am glad you called, we wrote your phone number down wrong so we couldn't get a hold of you to tell you we are not going to deliver your food.  We don't deliver that far.\"  I asked her why they took my order in the first place and why they didn't just deliver the pizzas regardless and she responded by telling me it wasn't their mistake.  (Please keep in mind...I LIVE 7 MINUTES AWAY.)  I voiced my concern to the manager, informing him that my children are now very hungry because he refused to deliver to my house that is under 3 miles away and he told me that he would call me when they were less busy.

The fajita was actually chopped up chicken (like you'd find in a chicken cheese steak). It was 9 dollars and absolutely not worth it- even to my ridiculously hungover want to eat something fatty and greasy self.\n\nNext time got another wrap- it came with fried chicken not grilled- okay my fault I should have specified but typically not used to getting fried chicken in a chicken wrap. Also flavorless and at 9 dollars not worth it at all. The honey mustard was gross, the chicken was over cooked and greasy.\n\nNext time- grilled chicken Apple walnut salad with mozzarella cheese. The mozzarella cheese was literally flavorless pizza cheese, the apples were completely rotten and mushy had to pick them out and toss them and the salad itself was wet so when the dressing was mixed in it was a watered down mess of a 10 salad. \n\nI give up on this place. Not to mention like others have said the owner is rude. I've asked questions such as \"does the Greek salad come with chicken\" and was answered condescendingly no it comes with feta. Um for 9 dollars without protein sorry thought I was missing something ?\n\nSkip this place is my suggestion I know I will be going the few extra blocks for more edible food that is less expensive.",

It's pseudo-Americanized versions of Mediterranean classic cuisine. The corporate chefs got so many things wrong:  Skordalia is a classic Greek dip made out of potatoes and garlic (not bread).  Avgolemono is chicken soup with egg, lemon and rice -- not this thin, awful broth they are currently serving. If one wants true Greek cooking, one should go to Greektown in either Detroit or Toronto. \nJust say no.",

Well, I continue on the path to the restroom and the manager, yes, the manager, had the audacity to tell me if I proceeded to the restroom that he would come on after me. I thought he was joking. But no, he was serious, then he told me I needed to tip the bartender before using the restroom, even though I hadn't sat down to order anything yet. I was clearly upset and walked back out to leave. The guy at the door was very nice and lead me back in to use the restroom. I decided after being treated that way, by the manager, that this was not an establishment I would be frequenting any longer, even though I loved the place. I went to the restroom and came back out and put $3 on the bar, because I needed to \"tip\" to use the restroom. Well, the guy at the door said that the manager had ASSUMED that we came from a rave across the street and that we just wanted to use the restroom. Well, his assumption lost him business, and I have been living in the Bay Area for 32 years. I'm pretty sure telling a patron you are going to follow them into he women's restroom is some form of sexual harassment. I have NEVER been treated like that ever in an establishment. Hopefully, for the greater good of the restaurant, that manager is no longer there.",

I frequently traveled from South Philly to buy sandwiches, but on my last few visits, the experience was horrible.  There is a new cook who simply is unskilled or uncaring about making sandwiches.  This lack of skill or disdain shows up in the quality of the food.  The woman that takes the orders gets more miserable by the visit.  The cook has changed and it is not for the better.  My last visit I had a confrontation with the cook about pickles on the side.  Even the other employees seemed embarrassed that this was going on.  If you have heard of Larry's reputation for great food, please move on.  That day has passed and the customer service absolutely sucks.  It's sad to see a well regarded establishment come to this!  I read in other reviews that the management changed and it has.

I am of creole descent and I grew up on this food ,but like I said if you go to Louisiana (especially bayous were it started not new Orleans) you'll know what I'm talking about. For rookie creole/Cajun palates it's descent though.",

They had live music that sounded more like entertainment at a nursing home, a really untalented guy (how they found him in the city of greats I have no idea), basically constantly asking for tips and in between hitting some notes on his keyboard. \nThe food was the worst part, 35 minute wait time ended in terrible beignets that taste mostly like oil and an omelette that went straight to the dumpster where it belongs.  Poor quality and the worst part is that they don't even try.  In this city a place like this should not pass.",

It worth mentioning that this is all you can eat restaurant; however, in order to make us feel full quickly, they decided to put a quantity of rice double the size of the sushi. When we left some rice, they decided to charge us for it. They were not polite by telling us you're ordering too much quantities and that's why we concluded that they put too much rice.

When something is improperly cooked, the kitchen's job is to fix it. When I asked for my raw dish to be cooked a bit more, I received it incredibly overcooked. A translucent egg is raw. That is not sunny side up. A cool red center is not medium. That is medium rate. There are so many wonderful choices on Nashville, that kind of kitchen attitude is certainly bad for business.   At the very least, the waitress could have sent a manager over at my obvious displeasure. Perhaps customer service is not important with the \"midtown\" crowd.",

    "text": "For all I'm about to say, I feel I have to mention again that this is an honest review and I'm not even embellishing much on my experience here. I'll give them two stars. \n\nOne extra star because they did something I can appreciate out here in the middle of the USA. They didn't try to charge me $8 for a simple Vietnamese sandwich. You guys HAVE to understand that these bAnh mi sandwiches are a DOLLAR in Asia!!! They are $2-3 dollars in California but for some dang reason they are $5-8 in the heart of the USA. I ate it up gratefully and happily. It wasn't as good as the last bAnh mi I had which was in SE Asia (mystery meat and questionable cleanliness standards but soooo dang tasty and I felt fine after eating it), but it hit my craving spot like a hammer.\n\nAlong with a bAnh mi was an order of goi cuon (spring rolls). The rolls were pretty small and the dipping sauce was crap. I'm sorry for not sugar coating, but it was absolutely crap. Like I tasted it and was like, \"dude wtf is this?!?!\" It was bland, and the strangest color I've ever seen in a goi cuon dipping sauce. It was like a light grayish brown with a less than creamy little bit more watery than creamy diarrhea texture. It was a very stupid dipping sauce. If people in Indiana say, \"I hate Vietnamese food.\" I would first blame this restaurant as the prime culprit. I would rebut with, \"did you, by chance, eat at Saigon Restaurant?\" If this was someone's sole venture into Vietnamese food, I plead for them to try somewhere better and give it another try.\n\nThe next dish up... hu tieu bo kho. Beef stew with noodles. The beef was nice and tender and there were some great bits of tendon and carrot, but seriously... no real bo kho looks like what we were served. The broth should be a rich dark brown with a bit of orange oil highlighting the surface. This just looked like very dirty Pho broth. This is not the beef stew you serve to dip bread in. I feel like I was being served counterfeit Vietnamese food. I think that's why I'm not happy writing this review. \n\nFortunately there seems to be some competition in Indianapolis for viet restaurants though. I hope that puts some fire in the competition and makes for better quality authentic Viet grub. If restaurants like this one is killing the first impression to the Indiana market, there may be no coming back!\n\nIt gets worse. The viet iced coffee tasted like soap. I cannot explain it. Did they not rinse the glasses throughly? Perhaps it was the viet coffee press that still had dish soap in it? What happened there? It was nasty.\n\nIt gets worse. I've been around. I've lived in a single bedroom apartment with a family of six with a billion cockroaches as a child. I've lived in cheap motel rooms with roaches and the smell of bug spray in the sheets. I've eaten whole meals in other countries with cockroaches crawling up the wall. But for some reason this kinda irked me... I saw our waiter at the counter visually tracking a bug on the counter. Then swat at it with his hand. Then move things around a bit and try to kill it again. In my mind I imagined a cockroach was his victim. I watched and watched... but did not notice any washing of hands after that hunting trip. Why were there no towels drying off his hands within the next five minutes? Why did his hands not seem moist at any time between this occurring and him serving our food? Like I said, I'm used to bugs, I don't like them and they still gross me out, but I can convince myself some stuff is okay... but why not wash your hands bro? Take some of that extra soap that was in my coffee and give it a go... I'd really appreciate it a lot. I'm sure the health department would as would the customers! It wouldn't take much more time out of your day.\n\nI came to Indianapolis in search of good Asian food that would solve a series of cravings. I'll keep looking. Louisville has some great solutions. Perhaps Ohio is where I'll look next...\n\nI'm thinking of taking away that extra star... yeah...",

    "text": "You get what you see--chicken fingers. They also serve wings and other overpriced items like mac and cheese (mediocre) and pastries (meh). \n\nThe sauces are unique and probably the best part about this place as you won't be able to find sauces like this elsewhere. Be watchful of how full the sauce is because some of the containers are not completely full and you get jipped. Sadly you can't sample the sauces without having to buy them. My favorite is bar b q sauce. It has a slight acidic vinegar kick, but isn't bittersweet. Maybe they cut back on the sugar? The chipotle lime mayo is great. It isn't too creamy and oily. The chipotle is subtle, almost dull and a little bit more would make it better and bold. I found myself having to double dunk the chicken in this sauce to really taste it. You always finish it wishing you had a little more. I've tried almost all of them and none of them are too memorable that I can recall anything great or bad about the rest of the sauces.\n\nThe breading is thin and crisp, which I appreciate. With one bite you taste the breading and chicken, and not just breading on heavily breaded chicken that other places might serve. The breading can be over salty and seasoned too much. Don't mistake this for rich and intense. It is salty. I end up drinking a lot of water with this meal partially due to this. What makes the breading suck is that it is not always fresh. Who knows how long the chicken has been sitting out.\n\nThe meat can be hit or miss; the chicken can be a little parched. This is disappointing when you have a whole pound of chicken to consume that will leave your mouth dry and leave you bloated after you drink a lot to quench your thirst and high sodium intake. More often then not, I always get the dried, salty chicken instead of the juicy, tender chicken that I once got at my very first visit. Perhaps I am unlucky and get the left over stale pieces that have been sitting out long. I can only recall once when my chicken was tender and juicy when they first opened.I try to avoid wasting money here because I have not had the same type of meal since my first. However, out of desperation to try something different than the usual univ city food, I have eaten here a few times to make this review justified.\n\nWhat my friends and I would like to do is split up and someone get french fries from Greek Lady and the others get chicken from Wishbone. We would satisfy our elementary palates by eating chicken fingers and french fries. If you are willing to walk a few more blocks, Allegros has really good curly fries but portions are a lot bigger when you eat at the place.\n\nI would have given this place 1.5 stars for the food, but they once cancelled a chicken wing eating contest on my friends and me just hours prior to the event with poor explanation so I knock it down to 0.5 stars, but yelp doesn't have 0.5 increments.",

    "text": "Came here for brunch at 1 on a Saturday while visiting from out of town. Drinks are good but come out slow and it took over an hour to bring out our appetizer The service is really slow. Our server seemed very overwhelmed but the restaurant wasn't even packed. On a Saturday afternoon with nice weather there should probably be more servers working. Tables are left messy and we actually had to wipe the food off of our table ourselves.\n\nI ordered the steak and eggs and when I asked our server if the eggs could be prepared over easy instead of scrambled, she said she didn't know because they pre scramble the eggs in the morning...\n\nWhen our food came out it was atrocious. I am appalled that the kitchen would even send it out in the state that it was. 1 burger had an eggshell on it and the other had cold congealed cheese and the bun was twice the size of he burger. The steak and eggs were the size of a side. And the eggs were scrambled...\n\nAdvice to management- hire bussers and greet people as they walk in... It's not always obvious when you should seat yourself. Also isn't fair for servers to have to have to apologize for management and kitchen staff not doing their jobs right.\n\nAfter all was said and done, management gave us $10 gift cards which didn't even cover the cost of our drinks and even our server said 'this is bullshit'.",

    "text": "Buffalo Wings generally have pretty consistent service and food quality -- I mean, how hard is it to serve reheated chicken and beer?  Well--evidently, pretty hard.  We arrived at 5:45 -- pretty early for dinner -- and were told a 20-30 minute wait, which turned into a 45 minute wait.  That should have been our first sign something was amiss.  After waiting 45 minutes, we already knew what we wanted to order, so ordered immediately after being seated at 6:30.  We ordered a chicken salad, a burger, a wrap, boneless wings, and a kids mini corn dogs.  60 minutes later we finally got our food.  Our waitress was great, and came by every 10 minutes to ask if we needed anything (other than our food), but all she could say is it should be coming, it should be coming.  We asked if the order was lost, and she said she saw it up on the screen in the kitchen, and said she had confirmed the kitchen had seen it, and that the screen shows them how long a order has gone unfilled, so they should know it had been an hour.  She had even talked with the manger.  Despite this, it took a full 60 minutes to bring out 6 items which literally have 5 minute prep time.  The chicken on the salad, wrap, and wings had all been precooked and heated under a heat lamp -- they were all dry.  They also put dressing on the salad despite asking for it on the side.  The waitress insisted on the manager coming over to us.  She asked him several times.  He finally came over as we were trying to leave, and said \"what is the problem\" curtly as if the waitress hadn't already told him 10 times, before, during, and after our meal was delayed an hour.  When my 74 year old mother politely told him (remember, the waitress asked him to come over, not us), he replied \"did everything come out ok?\" as if the only thing that mattered was did we receive edible food or not after waiting 1 hour and 45 minutes.  The guy acted exasperated, like the whole thing was out of his control.  Dude, I hate to break it to you, but your the manager.  This place is bleeding money -- if you can't get food out in under an hour, you can't turn tables.  The faster you turn tables, the more customers you can serve, and the more money you make.  Also, the less the wait time, so less customers get frustrated and leave and are less likely to come back.  With an hour wait for food, less customers are going to come back again, including us.  Sayonara Buffalo Wings -- it was nice knowing you for 20 years, but after 86th/Ditch service/kitchen went downhill, we were only willing to give you one last chance, and despite having a brand new restaurant with a brand new general manager, you managed to disappoint us even further.  We simply have too many casual dining and bar and grill options to waste our time and money with you.",

Cashier at beer garden refused to ring out my other three items even though other cashiers have done it there before. When I asked if I am expected to go get in another line she said yes I guess so. Needless to say I cashed out my other three items and did not buy the beer from them. With grocery stores stealing business from bars and restaurants maybe they should try to be a little more accommodating.",

She was much more interested in being right than doing what she could to help me as the customer of a large order.

I absolutely can not stand toasted. I specifically told them not toasted, and no middle slice of bread. When my order arrived the coleslaw was missing, the middle piece of bread was in it, not big deal I can take that out. The big deal was it was toasted. I called, and they offered to give me a free sandwich on a future order. Today I placed my order at 12:08. I called at 1:07 to find out where my lunch was. The lady told me it was made and sitting there. What the hell you leave a sandwich sitting there for an hour? Apparently they only have two drivers on today. I guess since it was a free order the driver did not think he was getting tipped, so I became low priority. Here it is 1:23 and still no food.",

Now mine you we paid for these drinks I don't know about you but I've worked in the food industry and my store has ran out of ice before and we went to the grocery store and bought bags of ice brought them back and made sure our customers were happy until we could fix the situation apparently that was not the managers idea at this store. So instead of just saying sorry our drink situation sucks today u can have it for free they charge us. I went to 5 guys and got us cold drinks we started eating our burritos were disgusting they tasted like cat food and the chips were completely plain no lime or salt at all! Clearly someone has dropped the ball at this chipotle because it was complete garbage! I hope they can turn this store around because they've now lost a customer",

I was optimistic going in because Chuck is from Texas and from his social media posts and menu, I got the sense that his food would be solid. Unfortunately, I couldn't have been more wrong. \n\nI ordered the two meat platter - brisket, pulled pork, mac salad and potato salad along with an order of original wings and the only thing remotely good about the entire order was the jalapeno cornbread. The brisket and pork with both extremely bland with absolutely no smoke ring or smoke flavor. In fact they tasted boiled. I can't understand how this could be if that meat was in fact inside a smoker. \n\nThe two sides were both bland as well. I looked hard and couldn't see any spices in either of them. I then moved on to the original wings. Again, the meat was bland with no seasoning and what tasted like a bottled BBQ sauce. No smoke/grill flavor whatsoever.  \n\nI'm at a complete loss for how a BBQ place with a pitmaster from Texas could serve up food like this.",

I should not have to raise my voice to have a conversation with the person across the table. The decor is a reused wood interior. It reminded me of a wooden cave. Dark and monochromatic. Not attractive. \nMy wife  ordered the brisket for lunch with mac and cheese and steamed veggies. I ordered the breakfast burger. My wife's entree came with more bbq sauce on the plate than meat. There were 4 skimpy pieces of brisket. It was hard to determine if the brisket was good because of the amount bbq sauce the.meat was swimming in. The bbq sauce tasted as if it was off the shelf KC's Masterpiece or Kraft.  It should have come on the side so the patron could decide how much or little was appropriate for their taste. The mac and cheese was bland and lacked the taste of cheese. Bad bad bad. \nThe burger I ordered was supposed to be done medium. Instead I got a lump of meat charcoal on a roll. The Sous or chef should be  ashamed of themselves for presenting this in the window for service. This is cooking 101.\n\nThe service was painfully slow. I could understand if the place was jumping, but my wife and I were the only food patrons.\n\nAvoid this place. The closing of this place cannot come soon enough.",

I have a background in the biz so I understand sometimes there may be things behind the scenes like short staffed or doubling seating servers, etc. We waited 15 minutes and were sat. The ambience in this place reminds me of the inside of a Pizza Hut sit down restaurant when they used to have the buffets. Not too impressed. The menu also reminds me of a chain-like Italian wannabe. Nothing special or innovative. Yawn. Our server was friendly and took our drink order. She dropped the drinks off and said she would be right with us. We drank our drinks and waited...\nAnd waited...\nAnd waited...\nNo sign of her! I looked at my watch. It was going on 8pm. \n35 minutes and she never came to take our order. We left some cash for the drinks and headed to another restaurant...one we felt confident would be a better experience. \nCan't tell you how the food was, but it is safe to say we will never go back.",

It was bland and dry. \nThey give you a tiny (probably 20 chips) cup with chips no refill and \"salsa\" haha it was pico!! it had chopped tomatoes, onions, and cilantro. \nWe order chicken fajitas and nachos. The chicken was incredible dry, no flavor and orange! Nachos were ok. Nothing to rave but ok. \nThe place was overprice for the casual dinning experience and quality of the food. We just moved to this area from Texas and I must say, this place is considered mediocre on the south and for similar quality places, you would expect lower prices.\nOh, and lets not forget the \"we don't take credit cards\" and if you want to pay with a debit card, you need to get to the counter to pay and get charged $0.99 for using the card! WTH!!! You can tell a restaurant is cheap when they don't want to pay the fees for using a credit card and they make you- the customer-  pay for using a debit card. \nSeriously, you will better off going to chili's and get their generic Mexican food that at least taste fresher!\nWill not go back to this place nor will we recommend this place.",

We arrived in twenty minutes as planned, and told the hostess we needed a table for eleven people.  The hostess dropped her jaw and shook her head and said it would be a twenty minute wait.  45 minutes later we still had no table....we asked to speak to the manager.  The managers name is carrie.  The manager was EXTREMELY rude!!!!!!!  The three hostess are very rude as well.  They couldn't even figure out to connect 3 tables together to accommodate a table of eleven.  The manager then proceeded to throw her hands in our faces, yell, say she couldn't help us and continue with dirty looks.  It's unacceptable behavior.

So bad I had to create a Yelp account to write a review. That's how piss I was leaving the restaurant. \n\nLong story short, we ordered the enormous nachos which they now down sized to a smaller portion than what it use to be. Not to mention guacamole use to be included but now it's an additional dollar. We also ordered 20 piece wings but when it came out, there was only 19 pieces. (Not that we intentionally counted but there was 5 of us And we agreed everyone was going to get 4 each, equaling 20) We brought it to our servers attention who disappeared for long periods of a time. It seemed like we always had to look around to try to find him and flag him down. It was very annoying, the server to the table next to us was more attentive to his table than ours was to ours. 15 mins gone by after we told him, still nothing. Finally he came back and by this time we just wanted our check. When we recieved our check we were still charged full price for the wings. Whatever, it's just 1 wing but the more we thought about it the more we got upset because it seemed as tho they didn't care about customer service much. We seemed like a joke to them complaining about a missing wing. My bf flagged down the manager and when we brought it to his attention, he basically blew us off and said \"I'll take off a dollar for you.\" Now that was insulting. Then out of nowhere our server came over with a plate with just 1 wing on it since he seen us looking for the manager. We don't give a daym about the wing. This is poor customer service. If we would have went anywhere else, they would have apologized for the mistake which we all would have understood, it happens. Then asked us if we needed anything and immediately replaced what was missing and on top of that added some more. Now that's customer service. For what they did, we will not becoming back ever again. It was a daym joke. \n\nSo you have been warned, do not go here and expect good service because they really don't give a daym about you. It was a rip off.",

When I was explaining that Im concerned things are too burned, the owner lady walked up and snatched the plate away from me without saying anything. I did not know if they ate bringing another one or not. Only after I grabbed my waiter later he said they are not making another one ans would take it off my check. \nAbsolutely rude, not communicating, disrespectful of their customers.. \nthe only reason I came was because the neighboring miss saigoin restaurant was flooded but I think it's worth a wait compared to this place if I want to spend any money for pho and walk out feeling happy :(",

    "text": "Whats up with all the good reviews!  Vacationing near weekie wachee and wanted some good thai food and saw all the good reviews so though lets try it. 1st off came here mon cuz yelp said they were opened and they were closed so came the next day.  The thai lady with glasses sat our party of 8, they was only 3 tables in the whole place and her lack of enthusiasm to service us just set the tone for the whole meal.  Seemed like she was rushing us  the whole time,  quick to seat us,  basically  threw our food at us,  quick to take our plates and quick to give us the check.  Now i don't know if these other yelpers being from a small town knew what real thai food should taste like but this ain't it.  I got the panang curry and my bowl of curry had tons of over cooked veg small amount meat and hardly any curry. My wife got pad  thai. Now being from atlanta we had our fair share of pad thai and this was horrible the pad thai was wet, watery, too sweet  and the sauce tasted like grocery store bought generic pad thai sauce. The appetizers were nothing special and not plated well. If your desperate  for thai then do it, but if you are expecting authentic great Thai food aviod.\nFood ... 3\nDecor .... 7\nService .... 2\nAtmosphere  ... 5\nWould i eat here again .... nope, even if i was desperate",

We asked for sweet and low with one of our unsweet teas and didn't receive it. Had to ask for it again to then receive the sweet and low. We ordered the bloomin onion and the chesse fries. The bloomin onion was not the onion the restaurant usually uses because it was on the spicy side. The chesse fires when on the ok side since they did not put much chesse or bacon on the appetizer. So in all reality we ordered a plate of fires with a little chesse and bacon. My grandmother ordered the 6oz steak and it was also on the spicy side. I however ordered the same thing but I ordered mine medium rare but when I got my steak it was rare instead of medium rare and also was really spicy.  We then had to ask for a bottle of steak sauce because if you ask for steak sauce for a party of three you will only get one tiny cup full of steak sauce for the whole table. Had to order a to go order for my father couldn't make it to lunch and our waiter said he would put it in after we had finished our meal. When we finished our food and the waiter gave us our check we still haven't received our to go order. Had to sit and extra five to ten minutes to get that said order. Lets just say we gave a bad tip. Be caution to this place not worth a hundred dollar bill for a spicy mouth and bad experience!",

I reserved our room on line, and only found out about these fees when looking at the reviews on yelp when trying to find if any of the restaurants in the resort were worth trying. I called and spoke to a manager on duty about these fees and she refused to refund the fees since I checked the terms and conditions box on the reservations page. I informed the MOD that I had neglected to read all of the terms and conditions, therefore she refused to help. After returning home I looked at the terms and conditions on the reservations page, where the check box appears and indeed it does tell of the $15 resort fee, but fails to mention the $18 parking fee. \n\nThis room was $250 per night before taxes. The room was nothing special. I've stayed in La Quinta Inns and other places that were just as nice, if not better, for far less. \n\nI also was left wondering what happened to the southern hospitality that us southerners are supposed to be so well known for.\n\nWhen I pay $250 a night for a room, I don't expect to be charged exorbitant fees for things I get for free at far less expensive hotels.",

We were wrong. We sat down to a dirty table, our waitress was barely paying attention to us, and when it came to paying the bill, we had to get up and go to her after multiple tries at calling her over. \n\nFood wise. I ordered the All-Star Special that came with two eggs, toast, hash brown, waffle, and your choice of sides(bacon, always). The waffle was thin but nice and the bacon was crisp. The rest were just tasteless. Toast was more like warm bread, eggs weren't cooked all the way, and the hash brown had a dirty taste to it that I couldn't eat more than a single bite. \n\nSeating right near the kitchen also, you'd think they would keep it clean to keep up appearances. The place was a mess with dirty dishes everywhere and old food sitting around. It made me really regret eating here.\n\nAll in all, I will never visit Waffle House again.

My daughter spilled her drink, which I realize is a pain in the ass for the restaurant and server (although we were outside so it wasn't that big a deal).

    "text": "I have been to Gullifty's before for the karaoke before I was 21 and with a bunch of friends we would stay and eat and sing. \n\nAs of last night I will not be returning due to he unprofessional staff and rude confrontations that I had to go through with them. \n\nWe arrived a little after 10pm, waited for someone to sit us, we were sat in the bar area for a 4 top table by who I assumed was the hostess. Our server came, took our drink order and when someone wanted to order a draft we all had to pull out our ID's, which is fine. Whatever. The server informed us, as someone was under 21 at our table, that we could not drink out our table with them being underaged, so we decided to order our meals and us 21+ would go drink at the bar and come back. We get our meals, start to eat, and me and another guest from our table go to the bar to drink. \n\nWe finished what we were drinking at the bar and paid our tab, went back over to our table to continue to eat and our server came to our table and confronted us, it was around 11:00pm, he continued to explain about the law about drinking at a table with someone underage, blatantly ignoring our friend, and how it was just the law [which we understood, and which is why we drank at THE BAR, away from him] and our server explained to us how \"It was starting to get busy and that because we had someone underaged we could finish our meal\" basically telling us that he wanted the table. \n\nI was very irritated by the server, this was rude, we hadn't been there for an hour, our meals were cold when we received them, and he wanted to get rid of us?! Seriously? NO ONE had walked into the door after this confrontation, and I KNOW because I watched the time on my phone because i hadn't seen many people come in at ALL it was a Wednesday NIGHT! \n\nAgain, 2 from our table went up to the bar to drink, I stayed with our underaged friend. We sorted out our money for the check. The server CONTINUOUSLY passed our table after our money was ready, avoiding us, un-attentive to anything. He comes back apologizing to me and AGAIN paying no attention showing sympathy to our friend. He is apologizing for the law, I don't care. I know the law. I am upset he wanted us to leave, we WERE SAT IN THE BAR AREA BY STAFF i told him, and that's not my fault. I became very upset. \n\nAfter this I decide let's give this server the table so he can get over it, me and the friend under 21 sit furthest away from the bar and look for songs to sing for karaoke. At this point I am now being bothered by the Manager. Explaining to me that the kitchen closes in 4 minutes and that since we've eaten he can no longer JUSTIFY our friend being there. I'm Sorry, didn't know this was Gullifty's BAR. Our friend waited outside, not being able to even participate in the karaoke because of the continuous disruptions from staff and the rudeness that came with them. \n\nTrain your staff and put some signs up about the 21+ after midnight for karaoke. I will NEVER be going back. I'd rather set fire to my money.",

    "text": "Not sure what the buzz is about this place.  I have neighbors who swore to me this was the best pizza I ever tasted.  I doubted it seriously as there is no good pizza south of North Jersey, but I tried it.  Awful is all I can say... and more awful than the regularly awful Philly style pizza.  The sauce was way too acidic.  I think they tried to compesate with sugar, but it just tasted like sweetened sauce made from rotten tomatos.  The topping look like reheated frozen nuggets of meat someone found in the back of a freezer that hadn't been cleaned out in over a year.  \n\nWe have done delivery and each time it seems to get worse.  Our last deliver not only was the food boarderline ineatible, but the pizza was delivered with all the cheese piled into the corner due to the driver taking some turns a little too sharply or tilting the box on its side... Either way, that was the last we will order from them for sure.\n\nOn the positive side... they did earn 1 star for being fast.",

    "text": "I'm still very confused by my dining experience last night. A friend and I decided to try a new sushi place for dinner and landed on Crazy Sushi. We got to the restaurant with a bottle of wine and both of us were very hungry. We were seated at a table, given menus and the hostess opened our bottle. We chatted a bit, had some wine, and looked over the menu. The first 5 minutes we were there the waiter came over 3 times to ask if we were ready to order the menu is huge so it took us some time. We finally ordered, food came out quickly, very quickly. The server paid no attention to the fact that some of our belongings were on the table (keys, cell phones, etc) before we could move anything he placed our plates directly on top of everything. We ate, food was good not great, we split 2 rolls and a bento box, with the intention of ordering more if this was not filling enough. Before we finished eating we were brought our check, which destroyed any possibility of ordering more. We ate all the sushi and were picking at the bento box and drinking our wine when our server came over to take our check, my friend stopped him because we had not put our money in it yet and explained that we were still eating and drinking and not ready to pay. Then the waiter said \"So you can't pay your bill and finish your food?\" so so so rudely. We both stared at him in shock as he continued to rush us to pay him and get out of the restaurant. I have never experienced anything like it, mind you we were not even there for an hour when this occurred. We were so uncomfortable we did not finish the food or wine and just left. We won't be back, mostly because it was the weirdest, most rushed, rudest service I have ever experienced.",

Decided to try the place because we see it all the time when we eat at Carrabas. We walk in and see one employee sitting at the bar --reading a paperback. He looks up and says, \"Oh, just sit anywhere. \". We sat ourselves and menus were brought to us. About 10 minutes later, he got up and asked if we wanted to order. By this time, we really didn't, but were already invested in the bad experience, that we went ahead and ordered. The food took forever  and was horrible. The sauce tasted like someone opened a can of Hunts tomato sauce and poured it on the enchiladas. There were no refills of drinks, and I had to go get him (still reading his novel) when it was time for us to pay. I thought, \"What a slug\". Horrible service, horrible food, and horrible experience. The place was so mismanaged -- rest room was filthy, from training of employees to quality of food. It has the air of a place on its way out, rather than on its way to the top. I recommend that you avoid this place.",

The fries were loaded down with salt...it felt like I was eating a pound of salt. Then I ordered the veggie sandwich. I'm thinking I'm getting a veggie burger nope it's just onions peppers mushroom on a bun. Super disgusting! It was almost $50 for us to eat at a fast food joint and the food was gross!  I could have went to Mcdonalds and had dessert lunch and breakfast for that price and had a better meal. My husband used to work at a 5 guys in SC and as I remember the fries came with the burger as a meal fresh in a bag and the burgers were huge! We had to take half of it home. \nI would not recommend this place at all especially if your on a budget.",

    "text": "I'll start this off by saying I've worked in the food industry as a server, bartender, expo, busser, dishwasher, etc for 10 plus years. I now work with disabled persons trying to help them find employment. We're not supposed to meet them in their home as per company policy. My client, who is disabled, and I have visited this pizzeria a few times per her request because it's close to her house and she feels comfortable meeting there. Today we went in at 1:45pm and I noticed it was busier than usual (typically we go at a time where it is not busy restaurant hours.) Before going to sit down like we normally do, and again this was only our third time here, We were greeted aggressively and immediately by who I assume is the owner. I started to ask \"do you mind if we sit here..\" and was cut off. He said, \"I have a real problem with you coming in here not buying anything and sitting taking up a table for 2-3 hours.\" (Mind you, we have never been there the previous 2 times over an hour and 15 minutes - as I have a limited amount of time I am able to work with each client.  There also has been about 15 other open tables in the restaurant each time we were there, including today.) This person responded very hostile and aggressive. Had the gentleman asked politely if I purchased a drink or a slice of pizza we could sit and go about our business, however he met me with an extremely volatile attitude and aggressive choice of words. Again, as someone who's worked in the food industry, I understand how it can be frustrating for someone to come in and sit without purchasing anything. With that said, how this employee decided to treat me in this moment made me and my disabled client extremely uncomfortable. The rudeness was completely unnecessary and being familiar with the industry I wouldn't have minded at all purchasing something from this place in order to sit there for an hour, had I been spoken to appropriately. The part I feel the worst about is how my client was treated. I had to explain to her why \"that man was so rude\". It's unacceptable how me and my client were made to feel today. She's already treated differently in the world and she felt terrible after this interaction. I'm mortified that this had to happen in this way, and this whole situation could have been completely avoided had we been treated like human beings. What the employee was trying to say was completely justified, however we were yelled at and made to feel like we were unwelcome for no reason whatsoever. I will not be entering this restaurant again for obvious reasons, and I encourage anyone who has any empathy for disabled persons to do the same. Again, the way we were treated was completely reprehensible and could have been avoided completely.",

    "text": "BRIDES PLEASEEEEEEEEEE DON'T BOOK WITH THIS VENUE!! I booked with this venue in the beginning of my engagement after meeting with Pat. He spent the entire meeting discussing all the lovely renovations that would be done prior to our wedding taking place.  Pat said that the renovations would be done over the summer (well before my wedding would take place in June the following year).  A few months later (after little communication from my initial meeting with Pat) we had our food tasting.  The food tasting was an absolute disaster. From the food being disgusting and bland and tasting like high school cafeteria food, to receiving a $60 check afterwards because our mothers came.  We were completely livid.  But the icing on the cake was the zero renovations that still hadn't been done, months after we paid the deposit. The very next day I left Pat a voicemail and sent him an email.  I'm a paralegal, so I'm extremely thorough and attentive to detail.  I emailed Pat all of my correspondences with Melissa showing that she never stated that I couldn't bring our 2 freaking parents and asked for the full refund.  I also mentioned the renovations that he promised that clearly weren't ever done.  Pat became a completely different person.  He said the food tasting was only for the bride and groom.  I explained that it was never stated in any paperwork that it was complimentary for just the two of us.  Our mothers paid for the wedding, and I don't eat meat so I would like more than one person's review of this food.  I also asked how can you charge for additional food, when you still presented us with one plate for everyone to share.  He said it's their policy and no refund would be issued.  Then I asked about the renovations and why the venue looked exactly the same.  First, he acted as if he never made any promises about renovations, then after I kept asking several questions, he back tracked and said that it's hard to get the licenses for renovations in the county.  So basically, no renovations would be done prior to my wedding.  At this point I was absolutely livid.  First if you are going to nickel and dime me now for freaking $60 then this is going to be a long process.  Second, I would have never ever booked with that venue based on how it looked.  Everything in the ballroom looked outdated, the carpet was dingy and old, and the venue as a whole looked old, and I literally had stopped looking at venues based off the lies Pat had told us. So, I told Pat that I was unhappy and would rather book somewhere else and that I wanted my deposit back.  Initially, he said no.  Then when I threatened legal action, he gave us our deposit back immediately.\nTHE MORAL OF THE STORY IS DONT BOOK WITH PAXON HOLLOW. From Pat being a con artist, to Melissa they are just horrible and honestly seem as if they don't fully comprehend customer service.  Two weeks after firing Paxon Hollow, I booked with Regal Ballroom and we just got married on June 10th.  They were literally the polar opposite of Paxon Hollow. Netty, and Chris were so amazing and attentive. The food at the food tasting was amazing, we were allowed to bring our moms, the entire venue was brand new and by the wedding day they had even made some tweaks to the bridal suite, we were able to keep the same date as before, had a million times better customer service, and paid a lot less then Paxon Hollow.  \n\nP.S. See Dan's May 2017 review on wedding wire where he also outlines the poor customer service, the horrible food, and the \"renovations\" that Pat is promising to everyone",

    "text": "Quite honestly, the worst dining experience I've ever had, not just in Nola. \n\nWe got there early for our reservation, and they sat us early. Good start. They brought out good bread. Ok, not so bad so far. First issue: we specifically asked for a game to be on their TVs when we made the reservation, and they assured us that the bar would be playing that game. They did not play that game. Oh well, not really a big deal.\n\nHey, that reminds me. Didn't we put in for drinks and oysters half an hour ago? Where are they? After another 15 minutes, a separate waiter comes and gets our drinks, finally. After another 15 minutes, no oysters, so we decide to put in our orders. Maybe the oysters have escaped.\n\nOur oysters finally come after an hour of waiting for them, and they're ok. My matza ball soup is pretty much tasteless. The broth has a slight chicken flavor but other than that, nothing. The gumbo my friends got was tiny. Our waiter has now not talked to us or checked on us in well over an hour. He is busy talking to the bachelorette party and some random guy at the bar. Our other waiter is busy with his own tables, but makes more of an effort to check in on us probably 3 times over the course of a 2.5 hour marathon restaurant experience.\n\nNow I get my entree, the fried oyster salad. The only redeeming quality of this salad is the bacon. Everything else was pretty much worthless. They oysters tasted slightly of salt, but that's it. \n\nThe bread pudding was only good for the topping and ice cream. Once you run out of sauce, it became literally a semi-thick, unsweet dough. \n\n0/5 terrible experience.",

If I could give them no stars I would. Could not run out of there fast enough. Their half peeled shrimp was literal mush. They had absolutely no flavor whatsoever. The shrimp peel was brown, they were probably cooked about a month ago, put in a freezer and served them to me as they thawed. Their jambalaya was further than the truth. It was pasta in tomato sauce with a minuscule piece of chicken. And the fact that I had to pay as I left was bewildering. Not even their mediocre waiters could save, what I would call, the worst dining experience of my life. The only thing that made it worthwhile was when the hostess removed the atrocity that was my dinner and asked \"they nasty?\"",

Unfortunately if you order delivery you have to wait more than two hours to get your food, with a chance of not getting it at all. \n\nPlaced a order via grub-hub last night at 10:59 PM with estimated delivery being between 12:15 AM and 12:25 AM. At 1:30 AM I called them to see if the food would be delivered soon. The man on the phone so they were really backed up with orders and it should be there in a couple minutes. At 2:30 AM I decided just cancel the order with GrubHub. \n\nI completely understand being busy but waiting three hours for food is unacceptable.\n\nIf I ever order from Oregon steaks again I will be sure to drive there and pick up my food.

This resulted in not only a long wait to order and be served your food at their lil bar stools, but also the food was cold. I had the jambalaya, which tasted like it was straight out of a Zatarran's box, which is fine if you weren't paying $10 for it. My mom had the grilled shrimp poboy. Much to her dismay the shrimp was not grilled and it was not large shrimp, but rather small baby shrimp. We never got a refill on our diet coke nor were we given water. Whatever you do, don't waste your money here at this tourist trap. There are plenty of other eateries to experience local fare",

There was a fair amount of people in the bar but it was by no means packed. We stood at the end of the bar for about 10 minutes waiting for the bartender to come take our order however she was in a conversation with whom we later discovered was her boyfriend at the end of the bar.  Finally a waitress came over and got us a few drinks. The guys attempted 3 games of pool but the table was not working correctly and wouldn't release the cue ball. My brother wanted another drink and waited again for quite a bit at the bar while the waitress ignored him. Upon closing his tab and paying for cash, the waitress did not return his card to him which prompted a trip back in the morning. As we were leaving, there was a fight breaking out in the parking lot between two men. If you're looking for working pool tables, a safe environment and good service then skip the Nite Owls Saloon and Grill.",

Very noisy and cold.\n\nAfter an initial delay to our food. Caused by what they said the chef was not happy with the crabcake being burnt.  My partner had the crab cake sandwich with fries.  She enjoyed it, but found the fries to be too salty.  I had the broiled scallops and shrimp entree, advertised with lump crabmeat and asparagus.   Well there was no lump crab meat and asparagus  was almost none existent.  3 scallops  and 3 shrimp.  Apparently  the chef is ok with sending no lump crab meat out with a dish but draws the line at over cooked crab cake.  Staff was apologetic  and gave us a $10 card good on a return visit.  Not happening.\n\nThey must be doing something right because the place was packed.  Maybe we were just unlucky.  But, our experience was not good, hence the 1 star.   Maybe I would go back just for appetizers,  but that's it.  Go elsewhere with your hard earned dollars.  $$$",

Not what you would expect for the $24 price tag! Our friends both ordered the Seafood Risotto and were also pretty disappointed. We were embarrassed that this was their first impression of dining in St. Pete.  It was a shame to spend $120 dollars for four ppl on just food and no alcohol and not be wow'd to say the least.

This was far more than minor PDA, it was almost vulgar in a soft-porn type of style. We parked and as we got ready to go in one of the girls was walking in the door. Although I can't be 100% certain, I do assume she works there....she was carrying a server apron and other items in with her. When we tried to call and inform the management, we were lead in a circle of automation that never allowed us to talk to an actual person.

This would be acceptable if the sandwich had any semblance of decency, yet it is completely revolting from first glance to last choked bite.The bread was completely soggy and drenched in oil that was hot enough to burn my hand. The pork was entirely flavorless, the provolone and broccoli rabe couldn't even save it. I regret wasting my appetite on this disgrace of a sandwich. Do yourself a favor and go down the street to Paesano's instead.",

They didn't even take the dish off the check, even though I wouldn't eat it or anything else after nearly having my gums impaled. I'll never go back & have advised others to stay away. Not even an apology. I should say there was a lot of blood & they couldn't wait to get me out of there (after paying the full bill). Rude does not even begin to describe that staff.",

My wife ordered the terriaky chicken, ended up getting steak with it, that she didn't order, but was billed for afterwards. I order sushi and Steak and Chicken, and the sushi never came out.    We have never had this kind of service before but something has been off the last two times we have gone in there.  The server, not the cook, was a bit rude and unprofessional getting on her phone and forgetting the order I placed both on Sushi and my drink.  I don't know if they have become complacent or just changes in personnel.  I doubt I will be eating here in the near future.  Which is sad because I used to love coming here.",

    "text": "Great product, but horrible customer service online!  I live in New Orleans and brought my mother some pralines once on a trip home back to Maine.  She LOVED them and I started sending her boxes of pralines for Christmas, her birthday, even Mother's Day.  The customer service in the actual Southern Candymakers stores on Decatur Street is awesome.  Over Christmas, the stores were busy so I ordered them off the website to be sent to her.  I sent her a 3 pound box and she was SO excited.  She told me last week, she needed more so I went on the website again and ordered her a 4 pound box.  I placed the order on 1/14 and paid $30 extra for 2 day shipping via Fex Ex.  The order wasn't even sent out until the 16th and when she finally got them today, they were peanut butter flavored, which she does not like.  When I ordered, it said, \"You must choose a flavor\".  Original was the first choice and that's what I checked off.  I called customer service, and the woman that I dealt with, Linda, should not be working with people.  She basically accused me of lying, saying there was no way that there could be a computer error when I ordered, even though the order info also said my mother lived in Gorham, Mississippi instead of Maine and my old phone number was on the order, which I had corrected..  I told her that I've been getting pralines from them for years and spending at least $100 every time.  She finally said if my mother sent them back (paying shipping out of her own pocket) they would send her the original.  I am so upset after being a loyal customer for 5 years that they I would be treated so poorly.  I guess I will have to find another company to spend $300-500/year on,which is too bad because up until today, I would have stayed a loyal customer and always highly recommended them.",

    "text": "Someone needs to find out who's in charge of greeting diners as they walk in to this place. I stood for almost 10 minutes as 2 employees failed to show me to a table. The first employee to see me hardly even glanced at me, let alone attempt to greet me. He was seating 2 ladies just as I walked in so I assumed he would be right back to seat me. Bad assumption. Luckily, there was a second employee serving a table nearby who asked if I had been taken care of yet. When I told her I had not, she disappeared for a minute, only to return to reassure me that it would only be a couple of minutes longer for me to wait to be seated, presumably not by her since she was roaming around in plain sight the whole time. 5 or more minutes of standing alone in the entrance way later, I walk up to the outdoor seating area and find the first employee opening a bottle of wine at a table. After seeing him glance at me out of the corner of his eye, and still not even making eye contact or asking me what he could do for me, I stand and stare for a minute while he works, only to find that second reassuring employee finally peek through and open the door. She proceeds to ask me IF I would like to be seated. Now from where I'm standing it should have been abundantly obvious that I was waiting to be seated, but rather than admit an error on their part, she would have me believe she wasn't sure. Now I don't believe either of them meant any malice towards me, but first of all the assumption should be that someone standing with their arms crossed in the entrance should be waiting to be seated, unless they've said otherwise, and in any case shouldn't they be asked? If there were a host stationed at that entrance this could have been avoided, but as it went, no one knew that I wasn't being served and no one did enough to try and find that out. ~feeling let down.",

We weren't going to get our bottomless mimosas waiting around for her bc she was sitting & rolling silverware chatting it up with her co-worker. So I took our glasses directly to the  bartender for our refills instead. Food was mediocre at best. I ordered the hot chicken tacos which wasn't spicy at all. My friends ordered the lox, it was fishy and it was more like smoked salmon flakes; no actual slices of smoked salmon. Pricey for what it was. The steak my friend ordered was very salty.

    "text": "My friends and I were visiting Nola for the first time and decided to yelp a restaurant close by to our hotel. This place had pretty good ratings so we decided to give it a try. We were on a laid back vacation, we were all dressed quite casual. This may or may not have been the reasoning behind our effortless service. We could tell we were being judged as a group of young kids pretending to be grown ups. Where was the southern hospitality? Not found here, at our table at least. \n\nI ordered the shrimp and grits, which was said to be a favorite, and I was extremely disappointed. It was SO salty, I was only able to take a few bites and had to stop eating. I really regret not sending it back but the service made me feel uncomfortable. So I basically paid $26 for a couple bites of sodium enhanced grits. Taste aside, the portion was also saddening. You get a little scoop of grits covered in too much sauce. While taking our orders, the waiter asked us if we wanted soup or salad. Where I'm from, this signifies that it comes with the order. But not here. So each of us ordered a side and got charged $5 for it without even meaning to. \n\nAlmost everyone else at my table had ordered a burger, which they seemed to enjoy very much. It came with fries which also seemed to have endured a heavy hand on the salt. Their large burgers with fries were much cheaper than my tiny plate of shrimp and grits. \n\nSo to round it all up, my personal experience consisted of bad service and unsatisfying food. The atmosphere was nice though. I'm sure the other costumers who dressed a little nicer and knew what to order had a better time than I did.",

    "text": "Hmmm let's just say avoid this cheesecake factory! Upon arrival they said it was going to 40 minutes for our table. That's perfectly fine it is a rainy night and I expected it to be a little wait. We walked around the mall and did a little shopping before they texted us to let me know our table was ready. When we came to check in the hostess informed us that our table was given away to a larger party but they were working on getting our table together now. Strike one! Don't text me to tell me my table's ready and then give my table away when I check in. I asked to speak to the manager and he also informed me that they made a decision to pull the table that were going to sit at to get the table ready for a party, but they would have a booth cleaned off soon.... That should have been my clue that it was going to be a sucky experience when the manager cosigns with a silly mistake.\n\nThey finally got our table pulled together for us and we had a very friendly server from what it seemed. We ordered and waited and waited and waited. (Ok we will say it was because it is a busy night) Our food finally comes out and my Chicken Farfalle was supposed to have extra Farfalle sauce on the side. No Farfalle sauce. My friend ordered the steak Diane and shrimp scampi. Her steak Diane was supposed to be MW however it came out medium closer to medium rare. We informed our server that the steak was not cooked properly and I was still waiting on my Farfalle sauce. The server informed me that she \"just had not picked up the sauce yet and she would get it\". Strike 2. She brought me back my Farfalle sauce and let's just say it wasn't Farfalle more like Alfredo sauce. When I told the server it was Alfredo she took it sniffed the bowl and said ohhh let me fix that. She came back literally with the same bowl she sniffed and said \"this is the correct sauce the manager said it's the correct sauce\". I told her it was incorrect and I have eaten this many times. She proceeded to try and explain how it was the correct sauce. Strike 3! I am done. I know what this sauce taste like and that was not right. \n\nI will not be back here and please whatever you do just go to the one in Green Hills! The Green Hills Cheesecake Factory service is always good and the food is always great. I've tried this one about 4 times and it always ends up the same. I'm angry at the service and the food is never good. I'm sitting here at the restaurant writing this review so that in itself should let you know the level of frustration I have tonight!!!",

    "text": "We ate here a few weeks ago and enjoyed the food.  So we decided to go back and have a nice dinner.  The place was crowded and we had to wait 30 minutes for a table.  Once seated our server took our order which was a main entr\u00e9e and a side salad.  In about 5 to 10 minutes we received our salads.  Everything was going just fine; we finished our salads and were enjoying the bread and wine.  \n\nAfter some time we realized we had drank two glasses of wine and finished the bread, but had not received our entr\u00e9e.  Our waiter never came by to check on us or explain why it was taking so long to get our entr\u00e9e.  So we asked the manager if she could check our order.  Come to find out the waiter never placed our order! \n\nWe sat there for an hour eating salad, bread and wine and our order was never entered.  We were giving the place the benefit of the doubt that they were busy and had gotten backed-up in the kitchen. We even over heard the table next to us ask our same waiter why it was taking so long to get their order.  We just did not realize how much time had passed until we ran out of conversation.  Wow!  The level of incompetence at this place is extraordinary. \n\nThe manager was very apologetic.  She was embarrassed at the level of service we received and made no excuses.  She of course comp our meal and offered to expedite the order so we could eat.  However, there is no excuse for this type of mistake.  Hiring staff that are incompetence is unacceptable.   Unfortunately, we will not be supporting a business that can't hire a professional waitstaff.",

Packing was so bad that the dosa layer has stuck to the white sheet of wrap. It did not smell good either. I called them and explained the story. I was expecting an apology and someone to provide us with the replacement if not refund but nothing of the sort. They did not even apologize, forget about refund or replacement. i shall be disposing the dosa as is.\nUttapam was not very good either. It tasted sour and cilantro seemed old. I could not take it more than few loaves. Remaining will go in the dustbin as well. \nSuch a disgusting experience with them",

There are three tables inside with ample room for a few more---not very family friendly.  Me, hubs and three children under 3 waited patiently for a table.  The icing on the cake was other customers---a lady practically climbed over my daughter to grab my hubs' seat when he got up to use the bathroom.  Seriously.  Not the establishment's fault, but all around poor attitude and rudeness abounded.  We won't be returning.  If you have children, pass on this place and enjoy ice cream at home.",

First of all, there is a $3 charge for any order over $40 which isnt that bad but you would figure the there wouldn't be a charge for large orders since we're spending a lot. \n\nNever the less we took our dinner home excited for our new found BBQ place. We got a half slab, a chicken crisper and rib platter, a brisket platter, and a Tennessee triple platter. Starting with the slab, unbelievably dry and the sauce was ketchup with Worcestershire sauce. They have this coating that I've never seen and I'm assuming it's because they were smoked, however it made eating them almost impossible. The chicken was dry and had gristle which was surprising since it was pulled. The sauce again, ketchup and Worcestershire. The brisket...the worst I've ever had. \n\nBesides the horrible food, I've never been to a BBQ place that didn't serve Mac and cheese. One star and I will never give my business to this place again.",

Our waiter approached asking if we wanted drinks and ordered water. After waiting nearly 20 minutes our waiter returned requesting our order, as she sat down menus.. We politely informed her that we did not receive menus and would need time to order. She indicated she would return in a moment to place our order. After another 10 minutes she returns and took our order. My salad was right however we were not provided utensils, which I had to go fetch myself. My husband also inquired if a specific game could be showed on the tv. Our waitress stated she would check and returns to tell my husband he would need to ask all 8 folks sitting at the bar if it would be okay to change one of the tvs that's showing the same things as 2 other tvs. The final thing that has disappointed me and caused me to waste my time to make this complaint is that 2 men who arrived nearly 5 minutes after us placing our order were provided their food (nachos) before us who also had ordered one nacho. \n\nContacted management with no response!

The spring roll was doughy with limp(not crisp) veggies and bland.  The duck abalone soup was the only part of the meal that had some slight flavor. My companions had the duck with vegetables over rice which looked very dry, and the vegetables had a burned oily flavor.  Another had the pork over  rice which was salty but otherwise underseasoned as well.   We waited about 15-20 minutes before our order was taken,  and the wait for the check was long as well.

As someone in the event planning industry, I will see to it that I never recomend this location to any of my clients and will make sure all my partners and colleges know of the dissapointment that is Gaylord Opryland.\n\nI was hesitant to even book this location due to the horrible reviews, but this is where she really wanted to go. Lesson learned the hard way. Never in my life have I been more disgusted with customer service, this establishment doesnt even deserve one star. As a professional event planner, I am very organized and always check my reservations. I have been planning my best friends bachelorette party since April, and booked online in advance. I called several times prior to our trip to assure it was okay that a seperate credit card holder reserved the room, and we paid with a deperate one.\n\nI had guests arriving from all over, some drove 10+ hours and when they arrived, were not able to check in. They were refused to it being under a different name, even though I confirmed this was okay prior to arriving. They needed the confirmation number, but the one THEY SENT ME (email proof) was not working. I called the front desk while still en route to Nashville to let them know guests were waiting, and BOTH women were extremely rude and condescending. My guests had to wait an hour before getting a room.\n\nWe arrived at 4pm and had a tight schedule as we had activites starting at 5:30. We were supposed to go in, decorate for the celebration, get ready and leave. This was not the case. Upon checking in, I am told that they preauthorize the card AT CHECKIN, even though I confirmed several times over the phone that the card was just to reserve the room and we could pay at check out with our choice of payment. We had girls from all over the country coming that were bringing money towards the room, and it was to be deposited before checkout. We did not have time to go to the bank before our paid for, scheduled activities and the only offer they gave us was to preauthorize half of the amount one night until we get the rest tomorrow. At this point we are already late and not ready for our outing due to their poor communication, and it ruined our other experiences as well.\n\nThe fun doesnt stop there....we paid for a junior sweet with a sofa and a chair, two beds, and paid extra for a pull out bed. Upon FINALLY getting into our room, there is no extra bed, and not a sofa, but two chairs. This was crucial to our sleeping arrangments, and was all requeated and confirmed prior to arrival. We also requested it when they gave us a room key, and now its 12 oclock at night and we have one pull out sofa and they are still giving us a hard time about the sofa. If we could, wed pack and leave immediately but this is a once in a life time thing for my best friend, so were stuck here. Awful, awful, awful!\n\nWhat a great scheme, draw in customers with a beautiful resort and then dont give a shit about them once they're here. Class act.",

If your idea of a \"Special Night\" out involves sitting in the dirt on tree stumps watching LA poseurs vaping after all-day wine binging sounds fun, this is your kinda place. Their walk-in hut offers beer only, no place inside to sit and relax. The outdoor BBQ sandwiches feed the crowd as they stare at the road to see who arrives next. The band was good, but were crammed into a corner of the dirt, near the beer hut with no dance floor.The only place of solace is the Tavern itself, and a charming respite from the outside. My ribs were tasty, but my husband's fish entre was a big disappointment. The servers were tense feeding the crowd on a holiday weekend. In short, I will never be back. The whole vibe just sucked.",

The rest of my experience was ruined by our server Jessica. She hardly checked on us, and it felt like such a burden just to go get a refill from her.  Based off her body language, and tone she definitely didn't want too. To cap it off though when we finish eating. We waited not five but ten minutes to get our checks. After she finally decided to bring the checks. Jessica brought a check not three checks. We had to retell her the order before we were finally able to cash out and leave. Definitely not coming back here and I would not recommend this place at all!!!",

    "text": "This was my second visit here, and it was much worse than the first. This restaurant is extremely small, and if there aren't any seats, you are welcome to stand in the back by the bar without seating, in the way of all the commotion. We stood by the bar for about ten minutes before we were asked if we needed something. We wanted to eat, but not standing up. We saw multiple tables open up, and had to ask if we could sit there, even though we were the only people waiting. We finally sat, and a young,brunette waitress came and took our order. We wanted two orders of the Short Rib fries appetizer, since we would be having it as our dinner opposed to sharing it, and she looked at us like we asked her to bring the whole cow to our table. She asked us if we were sure that we wanted two, and we confirmed that we did. The first order came out in about 5 minutes which was amazing. 10 minutes went by, then 15, and our server didn't even come over to see how our first dish was, just stood in the corner chatting. We got another servers attention after 20 minutes of waiting and let him know we were still waiting on our order. We also advised him that if it wasn't ready, to forget about it and we would share the first one. He came back and told us that it would be out any second. Another ten minutes went by, still no dish, still nothing from our original server. We let the young man know that we were no longer interested in the dish that was 25 minutes late, and then our original server finally decided to come over! Could you believe the first thing she said was \"so im hearing that you never got the second batch of fries?\". As if it was some kind of rumor. Then had the nerve to ask if we still wanted it. She took it off the bill but I was extremely disappointed with the service, and will certainly not return the next time I am in town. Especially since I got sick in the middle of the night from it. Village Whiskey, please train your staff how to serve properly, and give them some lessons on customer service.",

Saw that a regular frozen margarita was $6.75 and a flavored one was $8.50. Confirmed here on their website: http://neworleans.superiorgrill.com/drink-menu.html\n\nWhen I asked the bartender what flavors of frozen margaritas they had, he rattled off a list: watermelon, peach, blackberry, and some others. I said I would like a blackberry frozen margarita.\n\nThe bartender served me a regular frozen margarita with a small glass of blackberry syrup on the side. \"That'll be $11.75,\" he said. I said \"I thought flavored margaritas were $8.50?\" He said \"That's only for strawberry.\" \n\nI said, \"Why are you giving it to me like this? It's not mixed.\" He replied \"So you can see what you are paying for.\"\n\nI proceeded to pour the blackberry syrup into my tall margarita cup. It pooled on top of the drink and would not thoroughly blend with the rest of the drink. I asked the bartender if I could have a cup so I could mix the drink by pouring it back and forth between cups. Instead of offering to mix the drink himself, or providing me a spoon instead of a flimsy straw to mix my drink, he handed me a styrofoam cup.\n\nThere were two male customers on either side of me, they were audibly sympathizing with me and making comments about having to mix my own drink.\n\nIn retrospect, I should have asked to see the menu so I could point out that it said Flavored Margaritas were $8.50, and didn't say \"Strawberry only.\" But at a crowded bar with people waiting behind me to be served, I didn't want to cause a scene.\n\nInstead, I will vote with my feet and my wallet, and avoid Superior Grill and their lazy, apathetic, misinformed bartenders.",

    "text": "I used to come here for drinks after work and the Bruschetta which is delicious and super cheap (3$!!!).  I went for the first time in a long time last night with a few friends and the experience was ice cold.  We go there about 50 minutes before close and were greeted by the manager with no smile and a warning that they closed in 45 minutes.  That being said, all we wanted was a couple drinks and apps.  We did not do any entrees much less any dishes that required any significant time or labor, wings, my bruschetta, and one dessert on top of 3 cocktails.  Server was nice enough and very polite about replacing my first drink which came out in a glass that was nearly cracked in half.  We paid our bill right as they locked doors and let our server clean off our entire table.  We were out on the patio, assuming that it was probably the best place to be if you were going to there a little past close.  Needless to say, the manager on duty came out moments later and proclaimed \"I'm lockin' up.\"  with no smile, empathy, remorse, or hospitality.  I understand you are locking the place down for the night AND that I am there past close... but if you want to send the right message... don't be a jerk 15 minutes after you close and literally kick out all of your guests.  There are much more professional and friendly ways to handle that.  Wouldn't mind being asked to leave or step off the patio so they could locked down the store, I am not that difficult. Nor was it even that late.\n\nBoggles my mind, I've worked in this industry for a long enough time to appreciate good service and a nice place.  I am not that guest, I say thank you, pose questions politely, and only draw flaws to the attention of my server or manager when they are dire enough to be noted.  This guy was a joke, rude and unwelcoming from the get go.  I will not spend my money at a place were it feels like it's an inconvenience to have me sit at one of your tables....

    "text": "Glad my company paid for my stay for a conference. I would not waste your money!\nFrom customer service to expectations all around (particularly in the dining category), disappointing and worse- overpriced!\n\nIf you like mega hotels where you literally walk miles from one end and back- this is the place for you.\n\nI give praise to the horticulture team because the gardens are amazing!!!\n\nChecked in a prepaid party of 5/7 of our rooms.  It was early am when we landed so of course they weren't ready for us but would call us when they were, no later than 3.  There was some confusion at check-in but we thought it had been taken care of.  Only to find out later, it was still messed up.  We received notice that our room was ready at 4:30 and collected our keys and attempted to get into our room, our keys were not programmed.  Luckily there was a house staff member who also tried our keys as well but eventually used his key to gain entry.  Once inside, the check-in issue that we thought was resolved was not: 2 female colleagues, 1 king bed.  Originally, we had booked & pre-paid for 2 separate rooms, they had asked of we would share- it was unexpected, but we were flexible.  That is until we found out 'sharing' meant the same bed!\n\nWe immediately contacted customer service only to wait in the phone system for 20 minutes and another 5 before they thought bringing us a roll away would be acceptable.  NOT EVEN!  So after going back and forth our mysterious reservation appeared and we both ended up with king rooms; however we missed happy hour with our team.\n\nThat leads us to dinner....the steakhouse was too pricy and Solario, the Conservatory bar and Ravello's were closed, JD's had a 45m wait so we continued to Delta Island where our disappointment grew into aggravation.  Now completely starving, frustrated and tired from travel and learning- we ended up at a fast food version of pizza, including: a cafeteria line, plastic trays, plastic ware and plastic to-go boxes.  A far cry from a nice sit down and get served kind of meal we were looking for.\n\nMy feet are sore from walking all over this place, I'm still hungry for real food and I'm exhausted and, well, very unhappy.",

He further told me \"I got your money so there's nothing you can do about it\" after I told him I would NEVER go back to his business again.

That was my mistake. I was in a party of two. There was no line at the door so we walked in and sat on the bar side, after being greeted by a rather confused hostess. It took a long time for our waitress to take our drink orders. We ordered our appetizer which came with barely any sauce. There were two other parties that sat down after us but got their food first. When our food came out my fajitas were colder than normal. Usually they would be smoking which I was able to compare to the person's order to the table beside us. Our waitress was all over the place with her tables and was not tentative even though it wasn't that busy. I will not return to this chili's.",

I purchased the same coffee three days in a row and each day the price was different. Some days the price was 2.16 some days 6.56! That's a big difference and don't expect them to explain why. The quality of the coffee is just meh. Taste like it's been watered down. The chai tea latte has no spice some days. The one thing I can never understand is the total lack respect for customers at this location. I mean after being charged 6.56 for a cup of Americano I don't want to listen to you complain about customers dropping king cake on the floor and arguing about who should clean it up. Do your job. I mean if they put as much effort into their actual job instead of complaining this place could be bearable strictly because of location.   Wish I could give negative stars.",

When we finally found one, we told them we were going to eat in the back. There were no tables available so we came back up front. The manager came out and asked if we'd been helped. We said no because we were going in the back, but no tables. We asked for a table up front & she said she couldn't seat us because they were serving dinner only up there & forced a group of 5 of us to sit at a small 4 corner table. FYI, they were empty up front. Maybe 3 tables were full. She didn't ask if we were going to eat. She just told us no. Our waitress was no better. She told us the 5th chair better not get in her way. She gave us 2 menus to share & was annoyed we didn't have our order ready because we weren't regulars. We put in drink orders & appetizers around 7:15. The drinks came immediately. Around 7:55 we still had no food. We asked our server & she said she forgot. Our 5th person arrived at 8:15 & the food still wasn't there. We went & told the manager we've been waiting for over 40 minutes for appetizers & we will be sitting in the main area to hear each other. We ordered two rounds of apps & 2 members ordered food. They comped one round of apps but never once apologized or offered anything else. Needless to say we won't be back.",

The wine selection is really small and I would not say good. The wine we picked it terrible. It seems like everyone in here is waiting for something. The food was good, however no one ever came to check on us. Like at all. We are still currently waiting for the waitress to come out. It is very awkward in here, considering my table and 1 other table of 2 are left. Watching everyone clean.",

    "text": "The worst Italian food I have ever tasted!!! I'm far from Italian, but I can make a MEAN lasagna & spaghetti myself compared to this place. 1st of all, we waited 45mins patiently w/ a hungry Hubby, 2yr old, 7yr old, & myself. When we finally got seated, the waitress was very polite, but forgetful at times. Didnt drink any alcohol or sodas but the lemonade was very tart & the garlic bread was not-so-fresh...had to request for some fresh bread after my family devoured the 1st basket from starving & waiting for so long. I ordered the stuffed shells & chicken parmagiana. The salad was very tasty; however, they only have Italian dressing...no ranch or anything else. I am not a picky eater & rarely complain, but the stuffed shells & parmagiana chicken tasted HORRIBLE!! The chicken was very bland & the stuffed shells were hard & overbaked. The meranera sauce tasted like it was old or aged too long (if there's ever such a thing, lol). I could not bring myself to eat my entree. I had to send it back. I heard the lady at the table next to ours say the salmon was good, so I figured the salmon might be safe. It was actually very good! I was still very disappointed after this restaurant was referred to me by many. I felt like they got an easy $50 bucks out of me. I would have rathered gone to the olive garden or macaroni grill. If u r looking for an awesome authentic Italian cusine restaurant in Tucson, I highly recommend Contessa off of Ina Rd. The only reason we didn't go there is b/c it was out of the way from where we were going.  It's pretty far from where we live but always worth the drive. Everything is freshly made & u can definite tell the difference! I'm sorry Caruso, but I don't think my family will be coming here ever again!",

Two giant scoops of rice and just \"dollops\" of \"sides\" to accompany the \"dollop\" of curried goat. Oh, and also one plantain on top. Maybe for garnish :/ \nThe yellow rice was dry but good flavor, the other white/pink one just dry and no flavor to it at all, the cabbage undercooked and the curried goat (which was the main dish) was great.

    "text": "I purchased a groupon for \"high tea for two\" but really it should have been \"low tea\". I wanted to take my mother as part of her BD celebration. It took me three phone calls and two messages which were never returned to even get a reservation. I did inform them that I had a groupon in all messages and conversations. We arrived a few minutes prior to our reservation time and I gave them the groupon as instructed per groupon policy. We were promptly seated but no on came to greet us, take our orders for tea or even just a nod and \"I'll be with you soon\" for over ten minutes. Eventually someone did take our orders and bring out our rasberry sage tea which was \"okay\" but nothing spectacular. My mother's salad and my soup arrived....only my soup had been sloshed all over the small bowl and was running down the side into the paper doily and all over the serving plate. At a tea house, you expect the best service, atmosphere, presentation, etc. and this place and/or staff didn't deliver. Furthermore, my she-crab soup was very watery and really lacked any flavor. The rest of our \"tea\" was \"okay\" but again, nothing special or fabulous in taste or presentation. I do a better job when I entertain in my home with taste and attention to detail. I was trying not to make negative comments as it was my mother's birthday but the real insult came when the bill was presented and I noticed they added an automatic %18 gratuity.......for two people????? I would have tipped well anyway, even though it was not earned, as my son works in the service industry and I typically tip 20%. I wanted to say something but again, I was trying to keep the mood happy for my mom and it wasn't about the money but rather their attitude and greediness. Not sure if they had an issue with groupons or are they just this mediocre and entitled in general with their customers??? Overall, not a great experience and don't think I will ever return.",

    "text": "I've been 3 times, so I think I can share a fair judgement.  This business is a lot of show, without the go.   Service has been the overall department that has been completely lacking along with some breakfast items are products of horrible cooking.  First time: asked for black coffee and a matcha latte, dad didn't get his coffee until our food already arrived (which also seemed to take forever) and I actually never received my matcha latte after asking and reminding waiters more than eight times, 8!!! It got to be comical, which is why we counted.  By the end of our breakfast they finally offered it to me in it as a to go drink and still had the audacity to charge me for it, so I said no.  Second visit, was dinner with friends, this was a much more pleasant experience, there was four of us, we shared a bottle of wine and I remember I liked my food. No complaints here. Third time, was another breakfast round... I'm not sure what it is about breakfast but I don't think they do a good job for breakfast. To start with, we were given menus for both breakfast and lunch, which was appreciated, but no drink menus and we were specifically interested in mimosas or Bloody Mary's etc. because we didn't know what to order, or what was our options were... my dad ordered a Bloody Mary, and I ordered a Mimosa. I only mention this because it was frustrating to see other people have different variations of mimosas and also bloody mary's, other breakfast cocktails which we didn't even know existed.  My dad ordered a ham and cheese omelette with his side of home fries. I ordered the power bowl muesli.  We got through two drinks before the food came, which actually was a long time. By the time our food came, the order was wrong - my dad had fruit, but no home fries as he requested.  We immediately let our server know, and she said she would go grab them.  Additionally, our plates were extremely bland.  Just an omelette, no garnish or sides at all (other than the fruit in the side bowl.  The plates just looked sad.  Also, I could tell by looking at the omelette it wasn't good, that's how bad it was, and my dad concurred.  The wait staff failed to bring his home fries in any kind of fast or quick manner, so we reminded our bartender, who then reminded to server, once my dad got a refill on his coffee we also then reminded that server as well.  We ate through the entire meal, never got the home fries, and in the end right as our check was being delivered we mentioned the homefries again, and that's when the bartender sent a server running for them, and as we were signing our check is when they came out and were offered as a \"to go\" option.  While a simple side, it was really disappointing to go the entire breakfast with an awkward feeling of  \"I guess they just don't care\" and instead of comping anything, the manager offered me a $15 off coupon the next time we came in.  It's just hard to ever want to come in again... and didn't feel like an adequate apology on a $45 breakfast.  And lastly my dads omelette tasted like McDonalds.  Only upside was that my muesli power bowl was delicious, just hard to believe it took as long as it did to come out or that anything cost as much as it did with as horrible of service and lack of \"care\" put behind anything that was done there.",

My customer experience showed me that this place is a pluperfect symbol of foodie pretense, but it will soon have lines of chanting Milkophants around the block . Build enough odd food combinations, treat your customers very poorly, make sure dirt is part of the ambiance, and you too can be a Milksuccess. My customer experience was such that Milksop won't experience me as a customer again. I trust I have included enough detail about my my customer experience that this review won't again end upon the cutting room floor.",

Overpriced mimosas ($7 each for a small champagne flute is ridiculous) and the food was just average.  My husband and I left because we felt very uncomfortable after the table next to us ordered salad, which they were out of lettuce, then french toast, which they were out of syrup, and a couple of other items I can't recall.  Oh, and no table visit by a manager!! I can't believe this place is still in business.  Our bill was $50 for 4 small mimosas, an egg & cheese bagel, and an omlet!  What a ripoff!!!",

    "text": "I read the reviews and really wanted to try this place. We both tried the higher end restaurants inside the French quarter and wanted something more of where the locals go to for day to day meals. We patiently waited in line to get a table. The waitress/hostess ignored us and took everyone else's name down. Even the larger party that arrived later than us and requested to get some beers and wait outside was seated before us. I went up to the hostess and asked if she can put our name down on the list and she said wait a minute. We patiently waited again and after she seated more guests, I went up to her again and asked if I can put my name down. She then asked if we can wait at the bar. We walked over to the bar and waited another 20 minutes and watched her seat more guests that once again arrived much later than us. At this point I asked if we can have our table now and she said she will seat us once a table is available. I asked why she couldn't give us the table next to the bar and she said that table is taken. I looked around the entire restaurant and saw that we were the only Asians. I asked again when we can get a table and she smirked and said we can wait a minute. At this point we decided that we did not want to give our money to a racist establishment. I get that she MAY have forgotten to put our name down, which is what she told her manager, a very nice gentleman by the way, but that does not forgive the fact that she smirked when we asked about the table on multiple occasions. It doesn't forgive that she deliberately sat everyone who came in before and AFTER us and kept telling us to wait. If I was the owner, I would have fired her on the spot. No matter how good the food may be, which we didn't even get a chance to try, because this racist hostess/waitress ruined our dinner plans, it's not worth our money to be treated like a second class citizen. I would have expected more from a place that has such a long history of oppression and inequality but boy was I wrong. This hostess truly ruined our visit to NOLA and I would NEVER recommend any of my friends or family visiting NOLA to come try this place. It's not worth the headache or experience. Terrible customer service by a racist hostess/waitress that claims she is right. Please stay away from this place and beware! Please note the date we visited this place was 8/14/16 at 4:30pm.",

I know this place has been here for a very long time and the owner works hard to keep the place running but what i had from the dinner buffet was not very good. There was sweet and sour sauce on the buffet but no chicken balls were offered in the buffet on this day. I guess it was there to maybe put on the bland white rice they called fried rice. I have had chicken and beef fried rice many times in my life and there was no way that was fried rice. More like warmed up/steamed plain old white rice that was clumpy and hardly had anything in it. There was no vegetable in the rice. I honestly don't know what that was. I tried the ginger beef and it was way overly spicey and soggy. The egg roll was soggy as well and seriously had nothing inside it besides bean sprouts that tasted really bad. Not what i would call an egg roll. I tried the fried chicked that was on the buffet and that was pretty good. Overall i was disappointed though and will not go back.",

The avocado sticks had a great panko breading and was well cooked, but it was bland. The garlic aioli tasted like canned mayo with store-bought minced garlic. Instead, we put a lot of salt on them.\n\nI had ordered the shrimp sliders...that was the WORST!!! There was NO indication that this slider had shrimp in it. When I bit into it, it tasted like I had a mouth full of grease and gristle. \n\nThe server was very nice and accommodating. She asked if I wanted anything else. I ordered the salmon sliders...can't go wrong with salmon, right? Wrong. The salmon was good, (but here we go again!), it was bland. The sauce on it looked good, but that was bland too. After putting a bunch of salt and pepper on it, I took a bite and the bun was overcooked; it was toasted all the way though. At this point, I just asked for the check.\n\nI'm glad they didn't charge me for those meals. However, it would've been nice if management showed some kind of respect AND a professional courtesy by coming to our table to address our concerns. As far as I'm concerned, \"misconduct\" is a perfect name for this place.",

First, the guy didn't know how to make my sandwich (a black forest ham) and skipped to the next guy in line until he could get the girl in the back to come make it, leaving me just standing there getting passed over in line. He then put the condiments on and put on an insane amount of mustard. I didn't ask for extra, I just said mustard, thinking he'd run it back and forth 2 or 3 times and that's it. Nope, he squeezed the crap out of the bottle and completely drenched it. Then he can't work the cash register, only the girl can. Just one thing after another.  \n\nI then go out front to eat and hear a car at the drive thru placing an order on the touch screen kiosk (which is actually a really good idea), but the girl inside is telling them over the mic they have to come inside to order, that they can't place there order in the drive thru.

I've always enjoyed their food, however the service tonight was bad enough that I would not come back and I will no longer recommend it to people. \n\nAfter asking the waiter if he could switch the corn tortillas to a flour tortilla because I am highly allergic to corn, he responded they don't have any flour tortillas. After spotting flour tortilla on the menu under a different item I asked him to place the tacos on that, they could even consolidate into 1 taco if the tortilla was larger. The answer was no. After explaining to the manager what happened, he spent 5 mins talking about how it wasn't kitchen policy. I explained that I would no longer be a customer, he then proceeded to give us the bill for the appetizer and drink we had already ordered, without any offer to try and make the service better or to keep us as customers.\n\n This is extremely disappointing that a place I really enjoyed frequenting is no longer a place I would recommend, to the extent that I have never written a review before and am taking the time now to write this.",

The potatoes are undercooked and very greasy. Overall I can say the food is bland and lacks any real flavor. I have not had any other meal than breakfast .

I have noticed recently that the produce is not as fresh, but more expensive,  and the prices of the organic foods are more expensive than Whole Foods. This morning I debated on going to Wegmans or going to this store. I only had to get a few items so I decided on this Giant since it was closer. Big mistake. I have seen on average at least 3 or 4 people shopping around 5 a.m. In the past but today just me. They had all of the store roped off where it was impossible to get to certain aisles and very difficult to get to the register. In my frustration I went under a rope to get soup.  I was then berated by a number of people who were supposed to be cleaning the floors but some were just standing around doing nothing. I couldn't even walk out of the closest door because that was blocked off. If they needed to clean the floor they should have closed the store for a few hours. It would have taken less time at Wegmans which is where I will shop for now on.",

After ordering, my friend and I were told that \"nothing was prepped\" and it would be 25 more minutes. We said we did not mind waiting. We waited an hour but nothing was ever \"prepped\", except Mac and cheese or charcuterie. We had the charcuterie and left. There was no attempt to make things right or explain. Very strange experience and poor/ no customer service. The waiter was nice though, and I felt sorry for him.",

    "text": "There were two people in front of me. A young woman was working alone that night. I watched her take the other two people's orders and make their crepes from a pile of already made crepes on the counter and not prepare them fresh as they are supposed to. She took my order and I asked for a fresh crepe made to order. She ignored me and made my crepe from her pile of previously made Crepes and I could see that she still had at least three more premade crepes yet to use. My crepe was soggy and a little gross. I watched her from the moment I stood in line till I left and she did not make one crepe for the three of us.\n\nThe next day I was at the mall to deposit a cheque so I went to the crepe works to let them know what happened the night before and get another one to take home. When I started to tell the guy what happened he cut me off and said I was wrong. He told me it was impossible and I did not see that. So I tell him that I know what I saw and it happened for three crepes not just mine. Again he tells me no I'm wrong they are not allowed to do that and so it was impossible. I told him that he was calling me a liar which is a bad thing to do to a customer and that I was there and he was not so I would know what happened. I tried logic as well explaining that the word impossible implies that there is no possible way for her to have done however anyone could make a bunch of crepes and pile them on top of each other. It's not even hard and in fact obviously she did it to cut corners and save time for herself.\n\n For the next twenty mins he tells me that I have no idea what I am talking about, that its impossible to happen and that I'm wrong. He also has the audacity to say I'm just in a bad mood so I'm saying these things because of that. First of all this guy knows nothing about me and I was in a great mood before when I started to tell him about it I just wanted them to make sure it doesn't happen again. Now every time I come to get a crepe he asks me if I'm in a bad mood or not which makes me feel very uncomfortable. Plus when I told him that his customer service was horrible and NO ONE talks to a customer that way that wants to run a successful business he tells me the owner would treat me exactly the same way. He gave me a card supposedly with his bosses number on it but after I left a message explaining the whole thing I never heard back. That was over two weeks ago now.\n\nI do mostly enjoy the crepes although they are NEVER made the way the example looks. It bothers me that every time I go buy one he asks me if I'm in a bad mood and makes fun of me.",

I've never had a fruity Chili Rellenos, but this one was filled with raisins and pine nuts with very little spice or sauces such as Chili Verde or Rojo.  \n\nMy opinion, being raised in New Mexico, and extensively traveling Mexico and Spain was that this was an artsy attempt to upsell Mexican cuisine.   \n\nI heard reactions to the enchilada meal as being very coconut heavy in flavor, and even a Taco Bell Reference.  \n\nIf you wanted more authentic Mexican food I'd direct you to the closest Applebee's, Chipotle, Taco Bell...and that's not Mexican food as well.",

We were both excited about coming here as we had been to the previous restaurant at this location and were very pleased.  We thought we would be WOWed after reading the menu.  What we found was a pleasant but inattentive server and bus boys that seemed to be clueless.  The food was mediocre at best.  I had the poached pear salad.  The flavor was very good on the pears but for $8.50 I wanted more than 4 thin slices.  it was supposed to have smoked Gouda.  I think there was 6 pieces that appeared to be box shredded.  I could not find the craisins or walnuts and the greens were starting to turn brown.  My husband had the wedge salad.  Again, over priced for the quality and amount.  I had, as an entree, the Jumbo Lump Crab Cakes.  They had no flavor.  The mashed potatoes had a lump of cheddar in the center and were overpowered by Old Bay seasoning.  My husband had the Seafood Pescatore which he said was OK.  I will say the desserts where beyond excellent.  We were told they were homemade so KUDOS to the baker.  We shared a Chocolate Mint Torte.  My mouth waters thinking about it.  The server, while she was pleasant, came over to take our order and then we did not see her again until she gave us our bill.  We asked for flatware as our food was served with no implements to eat it with.  Had we had the set ups at arrival we may have had a luke warm rather than cold meals.  When we asked for red wine glasses it too over 20 minutes for a bus boy to provide and when we asked for water you would have thought we had three heads each.  We will not be returning however, if the person who made the desserts opened a dessert eatery, we would frequent that establishment.",

The queso is melted velveeta.  We ordered a chicken quesadilla which looked like a mixture of chicken and cheese threwn up on a tortilla.Also we got two orders of bistek a la mexicana.  To say it was \"a la\" was an overstatement.  The steak was chewy and luke warm.    Everything was bland.  The best taste was the refried beans- out of a can I'm sure.  The staff were not friendly. When I told them it was my daughter's birthday, it was ignored - no smile,  no acknowledgments,  nothing.  I wasn't expecting anything free or singing but a smile and \"happy birthday\" would have been nice. The staff never introduced themselves,  left dirty dishes on the table. ... Overall it was the worst restaurant experience in my life.  I've been in more than a few countries and even when I had no idea what I was ordering,  I got better tasting food and service!   Both of my children and I have food poisoning as well.  Avoid this place.  Oh and the bill. ... $75.

The woman at the counter presented us with two options for individual slices: pepperoni and spinach. We asked why we couldn't see any green on top of the spinach pizza and she told us \"The spinach is under the crust\" (spoiler alert: there was no spinach!). The service was prompt, despite them being busy, and we paid and left. Within ten steps of leaving the front door, the cheese on the \"spinach\" slice slid off the bread and fell to the ground. Granted, I think this is probably in part due to the pizza-holder, but cheese should never slide off a pizza that easily. What a waste of $4. I won't be back.",

The only kudos I can give is that the hot food I ordered from the kitchen came out in a timely fashion and steaming hot. Kudos to the people working behind the wall. Unfortunately, my family and I will never return here simply because the manager could care less that every, single non-hibachi table was miserable and waiting far too long for their food.

The male bartender was super apathetic and seemingly annoyed by our existence...ex: when taking our brunch order he just walked up and said \"Food?\" In general he couldn't be bothered to interact with us, let alone do it with any hospitality. \n\nLousy drinks --  the mimosas are a ripoff. We ordered a carafe, but it was 90% juice, only the neck was topped off w/ sparkling wine. We're not ordering juice here, people, we're ordering drinks! A mimosa should be mostly sparkling and topped w/ juice. I asked if he could add more but his adjustment made no difference. But here's the kicker -- when a friend of the apathetic bartender sat next to us, she was welcomed with smiles and jovial hospitality, and when she ordered a mimosa guess what she got? 90% sparkling wine, topped with juice! You know, the way they're supposed to be made.\n\nClearly there's no front-of-house manager to oversee and ensure good service.\n\nFood-wise, it's meh. The forgettable $13 & $15 entrees didn't come with sides, so you gotta pay extra to have potatoes or grits or bacon w/ those eggs.\n\nSorry guys, but New Orleans is a food and hospitality town....You aren't even trying. I don't imagine Morrow's will be around unless you step up your game in a major way. (and writing yourself fake reviews wasn't the solution -- glad Yelp removed them!)",

I was a delivery driver for another Domino's for 5 years during college, so I know that things can get hectic, but this was ridiculous. Ordered online at 11:00pm, tracker said it would be delivered in 25-35 minutes. At 12:00am, the pizza had still not arrived so I called the store. They said mine was the next one out the door and should be there in a few minutes, because I live about 1 mile away from the store. At 1:00am, still no pizza. I call again and they said the driver left with my order and another order 30 minutes ago, and instead of driving to my house first, which was 1 MILE AWAY, he went to the other house first which was further away, and gave them their pizza AND MY PIZZA. They offered to make a new one and send it out, but I didn't want to wait up until 3 in the morning, so I said no thanks. They offered a free pizza on my next order, but that doesn't do anything to help me right now because it too late to order from anywhere else. This is why Uber Eats and other forms of food delivery will end up crushing stores like this. So to whoever runs this store, seriously, congratulations.

We didn't get any water, or even a hello for at least 15 minutes.\nWe saw a table of 2 and 4 leave because they were waiting so long. We were literally about to leave when we got service.\nWe got our drinks rather fast considering the lack of wait staff.\nI got the pork chop and my wife got the half of a chicken. My pork chop was the size of a filet mignon and had some mashed potatoes on the side with some beets on top. Kind of expensive at $20, but rather good.\nMy wife's chicken came out hot, but she cut into the drumstick and it bled all over her plate. The waiter came back and apologized and took her plate promptly. He brought back another chicken about 10 minutes later and there wasn't as much blood, but it was still rather bloody. \nWe got our check and left.\nAs we were leaving we overheard the waiter telling another party that they're drinks didn't apply to the happy hour because they weren't sitting at the bar. They said they were not told that was the case. He said I asked you if you were here for the happy hour or for dinner.\n\nThis place has serious potential, the food I had was good, unfortunately, this experience ruined it for both of us. The beer is decently priced and there is diverse selection.\n\nIf you happen to go here, do not get the half a chicken!!",

The place was really busy so we sort of understood, but it got to the point where we almost got up and left.\n\nFinally, a very angry server stomped up and asked what we wanted to drink. No hello, no sorry, no eye contact. It was super uncomfortable. She pretty much forced us to make a decision on the spot about what we wanted to eat and after we ordered, she avoided us like the plague.\n\nShe had one large table half filled with kids and one of them asked for another milkshake. She was holding a bunch of dirty dishes and as he asked for the refill, she stormed over to the drink area right behind our table and THREW the dishes into the sink. It was so loud and it startled me. I can't imagine how the kids felt. How embarrassing.\n\nAfter a mediocre meal and continued empty glasses we asked for the cheque- and the manager. All of a sudden, she was nice and said she would be happy to grab the manager for us.\n\nAnother server came up to the table and said that the manager was just on a phone call and she was a senior server and could talk to us. I was not buying it. I had seen the two servers chatting at some point during our horrible meal and assumed they were friends and she was now covering her friends butt.\n\nNevertheless, I told the problem to her in detail and she apologized. That was about it. No discount, no \"please come back\", no accountability.\n\nThe worst part about it was when we were walking to our car, we saw the manager standing outside with a group of servers smoking. \"On a phone call\"?\n\nRight.\n\nThis place definitely lost our business.",

I was told it was the owner who did this, but who knows.  Whoever it was should be fired.  If it was the owner, he should be put out of business.  As I was waiting for the bus \"The Owner\" came out of the restaurant and started verbally abusing and harassing a man waiting for the bus.  He kept insulting the man by telling him that he would be taking the bus for the rest of his life, and would never amount to anything.  I take offense to this, as should any of us who need to take Valley Ride to get to our destinations.  Mr. Moon's Kitchen, you will never serve me.  I hope all of Boise sees this, and you never serve any of them again either.  You are completely unprofessional and undeserving of the business from the good people of Boise.",

I have yet to sample all of their fare, and perhaps it's a bad idea to fit them into the mold that Mugshots (which was gone before I arrived in Manayunk) occupied. But in the end, they call themselves a cafe, which translates into a coffee shop, moved into the location of a former coffee shop and they include baked goods and coffee on the menu, so I feel comfortable in holding them to some standard.\n\nThey were out of their banana bread. All of it. For all the flavors they described, they didn't have a single one left when I arrived. This is a significant portion of their menu, and they were out of all of it, which tells me that they have problems with keeping things in stock They had plenty of Baklava, but I'm allergic to two of the nuts they use in them, so even experimenting is a horrible idea.\n\nThere was a small child running around screaming, and I could hear arguing breaking out as I stepped through the door with my coffee. I'm not saying that without empathy, but that is never something you want your customers getting to be a part of. Even if the food had been perfect, it would have detracted from the experience\n\nAnd...the coffee...I have to  go back to that. I really do. If I has handed a mug of Starbucks and was told that someone had urinated in it, and my only other option was what I had here...I would seriously have to debate that decision. This is a horrible thing to say. It's cruel, and cruel honestly isn't that much more helpful than well meaning lies. It's even more horrible to look at in the cold light of day, and determine that it's still a correct assessment. But this is someone who, during his broke college days, would drink coffee through day old grounds. Someone who used an abandoned French press that was held together with duct tape, and I couldn't finish it. Seriously, it was that bad. I don't know how they did it, and that cup was an accomplishment in of itself.\n\nMaybe the owners are nice folk. Maybe, their Mediterranean food is really good, as other reviews seem to indicate. But they sure as shit ain't a cafe. If they want to be cheery, and have great falafel, they should do that. But dear God in heaven, who I have forsaken in so many ways, they put something on the menu so bad I am still  shocked. Combined with a lack of stock and that atmosphere, I can't possibly give this place a good rating.",

    "text": "I used to love Red Lobster but last night will probably be the last time I go; especially to the Fairview Heights location.  \n\nThe wait was horrendous.  We were told it would be about 45 minutes.  We checked back with the hostess after it was getting close to an hour and we were told it would be about 10 more minutes. Okay, it is a Saturday, still not bad, right?  Finally after waiting one hour and 45 minutes we were finally seated . . . . and after numerous people that came in after us were seated.  Everywhere on the internet it says Red Lobster restaurants don't take reservations/call ahead seating so my bad for not actually calling to make sure as apparently they now do.  Most restaurants won't book large parties on a Friday or Saturday evening or at least keep them to a limited number, especially between the 5 pm - 7 pm rush time because . . . it's a Friday or Saturday evening and they are already extra busy.  Not here - there were probably 3 or 4 large parties which I guess was the reason one family of five had to wait almost 2 hours!!  If they would have just told us upfront that it would be well over an hour wait, we would have never stayed.  Apparently that is what they tell everyone that walks in because they continually told people that came in after us it would be 45 minutes to an hour wait (they did add fifteen more minutes on!). Maybe the hostesses just need more training in figuring out semi-accurate wait times but I recognized them from previous visits and they've all worked there for years. This would lead you to believe they are just not honest with people in hopes of not turning customers away.  I totally get that it was a Saturday and expected to wait but not for almost two hours and not one full hour longer than what you said when we walked in.  That is by far unreasonable.  There were actually smaller parties that came in right after us (not call aheads either) that were seated, ate, and left before we were seated.  I guess a party between 4-8 throws them into a conundrum but they can handle smaller groups and those with over 10 with no problems.  I guess we were really the fools because once we were seated, there was hardly anyone left still waiting (many had already given up and left).  Honestly, we sat there patiently and only asked once nicely where we were in the wait.  Funny how a few people that we are pretty sure came in well after we did, but loudly pitched a fit about the wait were seated right after they complained!    \n\nNow to the food - menu selections seem smaller and prices are way too high for the size and quality of the food.  They've really just gone downhill over the years - the second biggest reason I won't go back.  The food was just average, if even that - let's face it, the Midwest typically overcooks seafood so it ends up tough and rubbery with little flavor.  The same can be said here.  The only thing that tasted excellent were the cheddar bay biscuits - still exceptional!     \n\nThe only saving grace to the evening was the great waiter.  I don't recall his name but he told us he was originally from Miami.  He was a very attentive waiter and was very friendly.  If I were only giving stars for his service, it would have been 4 or 5 stars for sure!",

Last time we go.... just isn't worth $47 for three adult tickets, then my wife and I have to run the theater too.  I will start with arrival, an irritated bartender, upset customers asking for help, getting eye rolls from employee, then once the movie started, had to tell same irritated bartender to have someone turn off the bright lights in the movie theater, the movie has been running for 5 minutes already, had to change out soda twice, both were flat, with very little syrup.  screen was dark, no surround sound on. All in all, was a great place at one time, now, just drive by, you will be glad you did.  It was obvious no management or any sense of concern for the customer. What a joke!",

The one place you never cut corners is in the food, and that's exactly what they did. 2 of the 3 salsas were so watery that you didn't get any tomatillo or tomato on your chip, at all. The third salsa, the pics de gallo, was the worst chop job I've ever seen in a restaurant. Huge pieces of Serrano pepper with varying sizes of everything else, and in stark contrast to the other 2, completely dried out. \n\nWithout even looking at the menu, I know what I want... #15. That decision hasn't changed for over 10 years. Today I should have made a different choice. I'm not sure if they recently went thru a purveyor change but the quality of everything on the plate was horrible. \n\nI used to love the rice, it changed. I used to love the chicken quesadilla, now it's flavorless and covered in 2 lbs of cheese for 1/2 a breast.\n\nPlease go back to your old ways and cut costs elsewhere, other than the food.",

I know a great water bagel when I taste one. However, I bought a half dozen cinnamon raisin bagels that tasted like onion. The first one tasted like onion. I thought that it, perhaps, came in contact with an onion bagel; no problem. The 2nd one tasted like onion & I thought then that they didn't properly clean their oven. After tasting the 3rd bagel, I called them to ask for 6 more. Well, the owner was angry & inappropriate. He sniffed each of the 3 bagels that I returned & said, \"they don't smell like onion!\" (Accusing me of lying?! Really?!?!) I would have simply apologized & replaced the 6 bagels...that simple. He said, \"you take bite, you taste onion, you bring back!\" I tried to explain that I thought it might have just been the one bagel. He got angrier & forcefully threw the remaining bagels in the trash before handing me a new bag of 6. Well, he lost a loyal customer for nothing!!!!!!! BEWARE; do not cross the boss!!!!!",

He kept the soda refills coming, and did a good job overall. However, this is where the praise ends.\n\nI went to this restaurant because I was in the area and wanted some Italian food. I saw the four star average reviews and figured it would be tasty. Be warned. It is WAY overpriced, and the food wasn't even good. The mozzarella sticks looked and tasted like the frozen ones you buy at the grocery store. They were $7.99 for five small sticks. Not worth it. Then came the entrees. Everything on the menu had cute names and sounded delicious. My husband ordered Chicken Parm, and I had the Baked Ziti. It was awful. I mean... not good at all. His chicken was \"ok,\" but not crispy on the outside like parm should be. Mine didn't have the brown, bubbly, cheesy top you'd normally see on baked ziti. The mozzarella cheese was barely even melted. The sauce tasted like it came from a jar. It was weak and not very flavorful. I had about five bites and didn't even take my leftovers home for the kids. \n\nSave your money and go to Olive Garden instead. I like to support local businesses, but this was an unpleasant dining experience. Let me say again, it was ridiculously expensive and the food was just BAD. I seriously left there wishing I'd gone to McDonald's instead.",

    "text": "My family and I come to this restaurant quite a few times. Sometimes more than once a month. But this time probably has to be the worst experience we've had. The waitress brought out salads for everyone when we clearly reminded her twice that we wanted two soups. And the soup tasted a little watered down and bland. Our waitress took forever to refill our drinks. When she finally did, she refilled the other two people's drinks and completely skipped past us. The food wasn't uniformly cut so there were big chunks of meat and vegetables. And when it came time to pay, we had a coupon for buy three hibachi dinners get one dinner of equal or lesser value for free. And they wouldn't take the coupon. So they had to end up making us another hibachi dinner on top of all the food we ordered. It was just a big hassle instead of taking the coupon and having the manager explain to us instead of our waitress who clearly had an attitude by the time she brought our check back. Needless to say, we won't be back...",

    "text": "first off the service is absolutely terrible. the waiter only came over to take our order and bring us our drinks and food. after that when we needed something we practically had to look around to hunt him down during our entire meal. he never bothered to come over to check on us to see if we needed drink refills or how our food was. even when we wanted our check he was no where to be found. \nas for the food; my sister had ordered the clam chowder and she had to send it back and asked them to reheat it because it wasn't even warm, it was room tempature. than between the 5 of us we had ordered other dishes and 20 wings (4/person) well there was definitely 20 piece of chicken on the plate; if you count the one tiny piece that looks like the very tip of the chicken wing that usually gets thrown out. \nwhen we brought it up to the waiters attention; after having to look for him for 15 mins, his response was the chefs usually cooks a big batch at a time so they probably miscounted so he'll bring us another wing. we waited another 15 minutes before finally getting his attention to ask for our check and a couple boxes. so by now we have leftovers all packed up and money in the check sleeve ready for the waiter to take. i wanted to leave a feedback with the manager on duty there about our meal so I asked a waitress to get the manager for me since our waiter wasn't around. now we are pretty much ready to leave and the one piece of wing never came out; that is until our waiter overheard us asking for the manager. because as soon as the manager got to our table so did the one piece of chicken wing soaked in oil. \nwhen we told the manager about the wings he pretty much brushed it off and laughed in our face and said \"I guarantee the chefs didn't count this as a wing\" and that \"they probably just shorted you guys a wing and so someone else here got that extra wing\". it was 20 wings for $20 so his solution was telling us he'll take a dollar off our bill if we wanted. \ni felt like that was a slap to my face and I felt a little discriminated, like if I wasn't asian things would've been different. I wasn't looking for any type of discount or freebie, all i wanted to do was give a feedback to the manager so he knows they should be more careful since this wasn't the first time they \"miscounted\" (in the past I've been shorted on wings and shrimps)\ntonight is the last time I'm ever eating/drinking here and i will no longer be recommending people to come here.",

    "text": "If I could rate them less than one star I would. I had the worst experience here. I felt discriminated against, disrespected, and attacked. The place was over crowded because they over sold tickets. We were asked to move from where we were standing because it would block the dancers from walking by. However, they brought out chairs from the back for other people to sit in that same exact spot. The second time we were asked to move because a couple wanted to sit behind us and couldn't see. A woman then turned a chair around and told one of my friends that the seat wasn't for her in a very rude tone. Next, two girls came in and stood directly in front of me which was also directly in front of the doorway where the dancers were supposed to enter, a server came to us and asked us to move again but said nothing to the two girls. We stated that we could not move where he wanted because then we would be blocking the view of the customers already standing there so he then asked us to move to the back of the bar where we would not be able to see anything. After that the rude woman (who told my friend the seat wasn't for her) had her husband tap my friend and ask could she switch places with me because she was too tall and blocking everyone's view. There was no room for us to switch spots so I said no and continued to try to watch the \"show.\" \nHe then tapped her again and asked did she want to sit down, she said no she was fine. He proceeded by pushing the chair into the back of her legs and forcing her to sit down. There was no staff around to assist us with these issues and there was hardly any room to try to find someone so we left before things got anymore out of hand. As we stood outside getting ready to leave a couple that lived next door overheard us talking about how disrespected we felt they chimed in and said that many of the people there are impolite and rude. I will never again in my life recommend nor visit this establishment.",

Once our drinks arrived (FINALLY), so did our dinner (minus the appetizer ). The waitress said that our apps were given to another table and they had already started eating it.

After 15 min, my husband flagged someone down.  Host came over, apologized and got our drinks.  \nFood- Definitely not worth the ridiculous prices.  My shrimp cocktail was so tough I couldn't chew it.  Scallops were ok but definitely not the best I ever had and not at all worth the price $32.  It was served with some watery cauliflower that they called \"pur\u00e9ed.\"  My husbands $42 filet mignon was a piece of tasteless, stringy meat.  Host asked how our food was and he agreed that the meat looked stringy and explained that he appreciated the feedback because they are trying a new meat provider\"!!  Offered to get something else but we declined. Just wanted to get out. We were offered free dessert. \nAmbience- sounded like we were eating in the casino game area.  Noisy. Very bright lighting.  One of the ceiling recessed lights was shining directly on me like a spotlight. I actually brought it to our waiters attention and asked if they could be turned down.  He simply said no and walked away. Furnishings look so dated including the fake fish tank on the big \"gold\" wall!\n\nWill not return.

There's often a long line of cars at the drive through window.  Even when there are no customers at the pharmacy counter inside, they seem to take a break between cars, making everyone wait for no reason whatsoever.\n\nRecently, I went to pick up a prescription I have been taking for years.  After I paid, but before she handed me my medicine, the woman told me I had to wait and talk to the pharmacist.  I explained that I had the flu and that I had been taking that medication at that dosage for years and I really didn't want to wait for the pharmacist.  I just wanted to get home before I threw up again.  She told me it would be illegal for her to give me the medicine without talking to the pharmacist.  That is a bold faced lie.  It may violate Walgreens's policy, but it is not illegal.  Ask an attorney or any non-Walgreens pharmacy.\n\nFinally, I was prescribed two medicines that cannot be taken together.  This Walgreens filled both prescriptions, repeatedly.  When I found out about the potentially deadly interaction between the two medicines, I pointed it out to the pharmacist very politely.  First, he had no idea those medicines were contraindicated.  Second, he acted like it was no big deal at all.  He never said sorry or we'll look into it or anything.  He just said something like, \"So you want me to take X medication off automatic refill?\"  I was shocked.  I left a message for Walgreens to complain about that issue, but I never got a return call.\n\nTime to find another pharmacy.",

Shame on me for not cooking it on the day I bought it, apparently.  Because when I DID go to cook it the next day (yes, that's right) it had turned brown and smelled awful.  Note that the other items in my fridge were fine (including other raw meat), so I suspect this was on its last legs when I purchased it.  Did I worry about being able to return it?  No...I go in there all the time (laziness and convenience) and in fact had been there 4 times that weekend because I was baking something and kept forgetting key ingredients.  \nSo I went in, without my receipt, to ask if I could exchange it for a fresher piece of meat (I really had my heart set on steak).  Tito, the manager, gave me a super hard time about not having the receipt...I explained that I'm not used to having to keep the receipt in case the food I bought was SPOILED, but he didn't care.  He then proceeded to tell me that maybe it was my fridge, that I really needed to receipt, and to generally balk at my attempt to politely receive a refund or new steak.  Finally, he gave in and I got 2 new steaks, but that wasn't the end.  He stopped me to inspect them on my way out and started saying again how he thought I had either left them in my fridge, or my fridge was broken.  I commented that if I had the same issue at DiBruno Brothers, I wouldn't be put through this grief, to which he responded, \"Well, we aren't DiBruno Brothers\".  No shit.  I emailed them and commented and of course heard no response.  I really wish that the little grocery at 20th and Spruce was better stocked, because I this place blows and I don't enjoy going there.

Chicken schwarma was just shredded boiled chicken breast which was also dry. Falafel was also dry and dense and not fried fresh.  Hummus may be  house made but too acidic and not smooth. Everything was coated with tahini in an attempt to cure the dryness but it didn't help.  I also ordered a side of baba ganousch which was meh with too much acid and no smokey flavor and you get a tiny container for 5 bucks. Really the Only edible thing in the platter was the salad. \n\nI am usually not picky and will generally eat and like anything. But I could barely eat the food I ordered. I would say that the generic schwarma carts all around the city are better and they are by no means good. Maybe they were having an off day because I can't believe that everyone who gave this place great reviews ate the same food I ate today. The staff did seem a bit confused back there. Did something recently change?  For now I would say save your money and eat pretty much anywhere else.",

Example:\n\"Ham and cheese omelet with your choice of toast, bagel or grits, 2.99\"\nWow \"Ill take it you reply.\" You get your bill 10.00. Scratching your head you ask \"how that could be?\" The answer, the cheese cost a 1.00 the bread 3.00 and so on. Shoot I'm surprised they didn't charge for the egg too. To top it off the food tasted like s#$% ran over twice. I could cook a better breakfast if I was drunk on bourbon st. Honestly, service was crap, it took two hours for a Dennys breakfast and it was off a street I couldnt even find. LAME",

As I was walking out this guy started laughing and saying can you believe that lady? She thought we were open and laughed. So I tried to get back in and the door was locked so I told the guy from the open window that I heard what he said and i thought it was rude! His reply was I couldn't believe you thought we were open, the chairs were on the table and the door was locked. I replied by saying that I walked right in and I had never been here before, there were customers eating also. Anyway he follows me out and says what is your problem. He never apologized or anything. I will never try to eat here again and let everyone know how rude they are!! There are many nice places to eat on the pier! So whatever you do don't eat there!!!",

The wings looked like they had already cooked them had the sauce on them and placed back in the fryer they had this weird taste and looked like something from an alien movie.\nSo now I drive to the Sorranos to take it back I asked for the manager he made every excuse in the book. He said we usually don't give money back it's too much. How did he think I felt paying that much for gross food. I really don't like leaving negative reviews but the manager really got under my skin.

Pancakes are still garbage. $3 plastic sausages are garbage. Service is still garbage. \n\nAbout the service. I ordered grits with cheese with my pancakes, sausage and home fries.. Do not order the grits with cheese. The \"cheese\" is a piece of Kraft American cheese cut up with a knife and put in a lump below your grits. The grits aren't even hot enough to melt the cheese fully and it is disgusting. The grits themselves are OK, but the cheese absolutely sucks and it costs extra.\n\nAnyhow, I got my grits and my waitress said, \"Check to see if there's cheese in there\". So I put my fork in there and mixed around the grits. I did not see cheese. She said, \"oh, sorry, I mixed this one up.\" So she picks up my grits, walks over three tables and SERVES THEM THE GRITS THAT I HAD JUST PLAYED WITH. She then picked up a bowl of grits FROM THEIR TABLE and gave it to me. Not exactly like sneezing into something and serving it to me, but damn close. \n\nJust go to IHOP.

    "text": "If I could give this establishment zero stars, I would. The manager/owner (I'm not sure what position he holds) is extremely rude to every customer that walks in the door. He's an older man with glasses and a constant look on his face as if he hates his life and job. If you see him, be prepared for a world of rude and abrasive responses. On one occasion, we went in and were told it would be a 45 minute wait even though there were multiple tables (both hibachi and regular) open. While I have worked in food service as a manager much of my adult life, I understand there are circumstances that are often out of the managers' control in terms of who is working and how many tables a server may have. However, there is an appropriate and POLITE way to address the situation. Today I called the restaurant repeatedly to see what time they served lunch till. The phone rang and went to an answering machine each time. When we arrived at the restaurant, the man, who seemed more preoccupied with his laptop and sitting on his butt, was extremely rude to the guests in front of me as well as to myself and my family. He snapped as us and said they are closed at 2:30 - it was 2:15 when we walked in. If the restaurant closes prior to the posted time, they should probably lock the door or put a sign outside to avoid any customer interacting with this so-called manager. I will never recommend this restaurant to anyone and will never be back to be treated so poorly for over-priced, sub standard food. It is pity because we live so close and would probably be frequent guests at such an establishment. Between our group and the group in front of us, the restaurant lost out on hundreds of dollars of business. This has been a consistent experience and it is absolutely ridiculous. Do not come here, go anywhere else that deserves your hard earned money. The experience and cost are not worth the time and frustration. This place should be shut down or hire new managers to run it. Ridiculous.",

    "text": "My girlfriend, cousin and I came here for restaurant week because the menu sounded promising. I mean who doesn't love downtown southern food right? \n\nWe arrived right around 8pm and the restaurant was completely empty inside. It was a typical bar look inside with wooden booths and dim lights. We chose to sit outside since our was a nice night. We sat for about 20 minutes before somebody came to take our drink order. This should have been the indication of how slow service would be smh\n\nFor appetizers I ordered the shrimp and anchovy toast which the toast was burnt but the shrimp had a decent flavor. My friend ordered the country pate which was bland and not enough bread for the pate. My cousin ordered the biscuits and gravy which was the only good tasting thing. \n\nFor our entrees, I ordered the shrimp gumbo which was decent in flavor but needed more spices. My friend ordered the country fried chicken which was crispy but flavorless. My cousin ordered the braised beef short ribs which were very salty. We were far from impressed. \n\nFor dessert I took the recommendation of the server and ordered the whiskey brownie a la mode. The brownie was stale and so hard. I could have gotten a better brownie premade from the grocery store. \n\nSo the slow service with the mediocre food will cause us not to come back to this place. It's sad considering the food description had so much potential.",

We told the unsmiling hostess that we were a party of three.  She told us it would be a 20 minute wait.  We reluctantly gave her our name & sat down in the front lobby. \nTony Roma's hadn't been our first choice, we had been told @ Moxies that it was at least a 45 minute wait. Tony's is not a \"reliable\" restaurant choice we've found, they have many problems and this particular evening was no exception! \nThe restaurant was Not packed, by any means. The problem was that there was no one busing tables!!! So there was sat, in the lobby, as we watched the ridiculous disorganization taking place. \nAfter about 15 minutes of pacing and watching all these tables sit empty while we waited, I was getting more and more frustrated with the situation. \nFinally I said to the stoic hostess, \"either find us a table or I'm going to go clean one myself! She looked @ me with disinterest & said she found us a table. \nThe 3 of us sat down at a booth in the restaurant side. \nMy man & I ordered the \"kickin' shrimp\" as an appie (this is our fav and the ONLY reason we continue to eat here!) and decided we'd split the 14 oz ribeye @ 38$ a plate. Our guest ordered a double breast chicken dish with spinach. \nThe shrimp was good and up to our usual expectations. \nOur main courses arrived shortly there after. \nOur guest began eating and said, \"you know, my chicken is burnt I think!\"\nWe looked @ it and she turned over one of the breasts to reveal a burnt bottom! Who sends out burnt meat??? \nWe called the waitress over. She began to say that she'd asked them to add this extra piece of chicken cuz it had looked kinda small. My guest quickly shut her down and said, \" this is burnt and dry as dry can be!!!\" \"Take this back and while ur at it, send your manager over here!\" \nNow we had finished our shared ribeye (which was nothing special @ 38$ .. Including the mashed potatoes which tasted like instant!). My guest was livid. \nThe manager arrived and was somewhat apologetic. My guest begins a tirade of complaints and explains to the manager that she  won't come here, as a general rule, becuz the place is always a gong show. The manager is starting to have trouble maintaining his composure, wringing his hands as he tries to calm down my friend. He tells her that he'll be removing the plate from her bill and hopes she'll give them another try @ some point. \nI take my turn and tell the already irritated manager, about his unsmiling hostess and how bad that is for business when u walk into a place and feel unwelcome. He says he'll look into that as well and promptly turns around and makes a bee line for the kitchen... He returns momentarily with several \"to go\" boxes that my friend had requested. She's done, packs up the majority of an unfinished meal and we wait for the bill. \nThe bill arrives and the ONLY thing removed from our bill is my friend's chicken, not her shrimp she'd ordered on top of her chicken or her beverage. \nJust a suggestion Tony Roma's.. When u have an irate customer.. Remove all the guests meal, not just a portion of it!!! \nAfter all was said and done, Tony's was a poor excuse for a restaurant last nite and I would tell anyone that this place is one to be avoided in the future.",

    "text": "Customer service here is actually awful. Had a girl named Danea (not sure if spelling as she did not wear a name tag). She asked me what I wanted to order and was gossiping to a coworker about god-only-knows while I was speaking. When she brought the wrong item and I told her what I had actually ordered, she snapped back \"you didn't say that!\" Um, yes I did. You clearly weren't listening. She re-made the order while sighing loudly. When she brought the new item back, she walked away to  gossip AGAIN near the store's walk-in. When she came back, I asked how much my order would be. It was starting to melt and I was becoming annoyed. She said \"I can't just add it up in my head. Hold on.\" Okay, more waiting. When we finally paid, I said \"can I have spoons for my order?\" She gave me a smile and started counting out individual spoons, one at a time, like she was happy to make me wait. This ordeal took over 15 minutes while people were waiting in line behind me. I've been coming to this location since I was a child but with all of the other locations in the area, I'll be making a trip elsewhere as long as they employ rude people like this.",

    "text": "First off let me start by saying this review doesn't reflect the taste by any means, because the burgers, tots and shakes are delicious. However, the service and the care for the customer are much less to be desired. This afternoon my wife took my two boys (3 and 17 months) out with a friend's family that's visiting from out of town. Naturally Burger Republic was the spot of choice since they wanted some great burgers. The trip quickly went downhill. My oldest has a pretty bad gluten allergy so they specifically requested the gluten free bun for his burger and let the waitress know. When the food came halfway through the bun they noticed that it was eerily similar to the rest of their regular buns. When they asked the waitress about it she then asked the kitchen staff and then informed my wife that the bun was in fact not gluten free and she was sorry about that. That to me is unacceptable. Although she apologized, nothing else was done after that to make the situation right. Now I have a son who's crying because his stomach isn't feeling well in between taking trips to the bathroom. If nothing else a manager should've been notified and/or the meal should've been comped. Luckily my son's allergy isn't as bad as some have it and he didn't have an immediate allergic reaction needing medical attention. Needless to say that supposedly great trip for out of town friends has now turned a days worth of fun activities into a day of back and forth bathroom visits and crying children. NOT COOL! Needless to say I can't in good conscience recommend Burger Republic any longer. Regardless of the great food, if they can't pay attention to the customer for something as easy as a gluten free bun request who's to say that the next time this happens there won't be serious consequences.",

Although they had almost an identical drink on the menu, they could not make the drink I ordered. Drinks took forever to arrive, which didn't go unnoticed by the table next door, who were more vocal than we were. Apparently the bartender called out. The servers practically ran through the dining room, which was already too loud and hectic to have a nice meal. I don't know where they were running to, since we didn't see our server almost the entire meal. The bread they bring for the table is rubbery (you could buy better at Acme!!) and served with the worst quality olive oil; they should be embarrassed, as an Italian restaurant. The pasta on the specials menu was tough, and the menu is WAAAY over-priced for the portions and quality they're serving. God help you if you order that $20 (!!) glass of Chardonnay... We ordered a glass of wine when our food was brought out, but we were done the meal when it finally arrived. On top of everything, they charged our credit card twice!",

It arrived, it was hot and delicious and filling, I paid and left. \n\nA couple hours later, I ended up feeling quite sick, and I wondered if it could have been something to do with my food, so I googled the nutritional information and found out that my pasta had egg in the pasta noodles, and dairy in the sauce. My waitress lied to me. \n\nI know it's not that big of a deal, I'm not allergic or anything, but come on. If you're not sure about the menu, ask. \n\nIf I could give 0 stars I would.

    "text": "Super excited to try this place while in town for 24 hours. We sat at the small 12 person bar and it took awhile for someone to take our drink order as there was only one bartender on a Saturday night. About 5-6 servers did say hi to us though. Drinks were fine. Apps came out which was the shrimp cocktail and meatballs. Meatballs were under cooked shrimp cocktail was fine. I ordered the chefs cut 20oz bone in ribeye with a chili rub and the wife ordered the filet with one of their toppings of cheese and peppers. The ribeye came out on a cold plate so I sent it back and the manager came over and apologized profusely. The best thing about the wife's filet was the cheese on top. She ordered it med rare and it came out slightly above rare. My steak came back out. I always order mine rare at steak houses and this was like a soggy sponge. Literally couldn't swallow more then 3 bites. The actual cut of steak was one of the worst cuts I've ever seen. The steak was bland. I had to ask multiple times what the rub was because I couldn't taste anything not even salt or pepper.  The beans that came out with the steaks were under cooked and hard. Needless to say I actually didn't eat dinner. The server came and picked up my full plate of steak and threw it away. The chefs cut was 50 bucks. And the total bill was 150 I literally spend that much at least once a week on food so that's not a big deal.  But I would rather spend 150 bucks on double quarter pounders with cheese and have to eat them all in one sitting then eat anything at this place again.  From start to finish it was horrible.",

First it began with the rude waitress, then the manager came over and made in an appropriate \"joke\" regarding my ethnicity. The cherry on top to this awful evening was when i was served lifeless skinned rubber meat on a platter with lettuce and PEANUT SAUCE, what mexican restaurant puts peanut sauce on a salad. I would recommend not going here EVER unless you want slithery chicken weenus sliding down your throat.",

    "text": "This could be an entirely pointless review, but I really have no idea what their coffee tastes like. I went in midday for an iced coffee. I wanted to sit outside, but there is no outdoor seating, just a spattering of chairs and tall tables with stools inside. I decided to stand at the table while I waited for my iced coffee, which was supposed to be made using their roasted Rwandan blend.\n\nNobody gave me an indication of how long it would take, only that my name would be called. They were nice enough when they communicated that to me, but I still went in with the expectation that it could take up to 15 min. After 15 min, I started internally debating if I should make an inquiry about my $5 iced coffee. Then, I decided I'll wait a little longer because I don't think I could appreciate the taste of a beverage hastily made for someone who was starting to get agitated.\n\nThe waiting continued, and then I started to think that my name was whispered and someone stole my cup (or they just took my money and ignored my order completely). I stood there, coffeeless and waiting, for nearly 40 min. Then, I just came to the conclusion that one comes to when they realize they weren't really that invested in the first place, which is \"fuck it\". I didn't bother to even ask what happened or try to get a refund. Keep my money. I am too poor to be spending money on overpriced coffee anyway. That transaction will stand such that I just purchased a fresh batch of casual contempt.",

    "text": "This was possibly the worst experience I've ever had at any restaurant. \n\nGeneral disappointments: They were out of orange juice, diet coke, and to go boxes. Someone waited twenty minutes to order food to go and then overheard the staff tell someone else they were out of to go boxes and couldn't accommodate any take out orders. (I think all customers would have appreciated knowing upfront that these items and services were unavailable.)\n\nService disappointments: While our initial interaction with our waitress was seemingly standard and friendly, I can't provide any additional positive feedback about her because we barely saw her again.The waiter who brought us our beverages informed us of their lack of diet coke and forgot 2/3 waters. We spent over 35 minutes trying to make eye contact with our waitress to get her attention - and although we made eye contact, she never came over.\n\nWe spent 45 minutes waiting for refills on water and coffee (and of course our food), while other customers who had been seated after us and were simply sitting closer to the kitchen enjoyed their food. At this point I stood up and walked over towards the kitchen to request refills, and a different waitress said she would be right with us. Ten minutes later our waitress came over with refills and said our food shouldn't be much longer. \n\nThis is now 55 minutes into our breakfast. (Just to be clear we all ordered eggs and the restaurant was not full.) While she was at our table we requested a set of utensils (since only 2/3 of our party was given a set of utensils when we were seated). In addition we requested salt and ketchup - because at this point we had high hopes our food would be arriving soon and our table was not prepared with these items unlike the other tables near us.\n\nFinally over an hour after being seated our food arrived with unmelted cheese on the eggs and 2 packets of ketchup for our table of 3. When the waitress walked away we took the bottle of ketchup from an empty table nearby and ate our breakfast. \n\nThis was a disappointing visit to say the least. I recommend you do not visit this establishment under any circumstances.",

    "text": "**want to clarify it wasn't the food that made him sick, he had the flu**\n\nI've been here many times and always had a pleasant experience. However,  I went here over the weekend with my boyfriend. while we were there he started feeling very bad (he ended up having the flu). He tried using the bathroom but it was locked. He had to basically run from the back to the front of the restaurant to make it out the front door. He got sick right outside. He was extremely embarrassed but did not have any other options. A woman who worked there proceeded to walk out and yell at him as if he did it on purpose. He was so mortified that he just left. After a text from him, I asked for the check and headed to checkout. This is where I headed to the register to find the entire staff laughing at his expense. when I let them know that I was with him the woman ringing me up said- \"well why didn't he try to go into the bathroom?\" I let her know that it wasnt' available. Another girl even implied that he did it on purpose. I was then asked by my server \"well I hope last night was fun, was it worth it?\" - I let the entire staff know that he was not in fact, hungover, but actually quite sick. Although it was embarrassing for the both of us, and inconvenient for the restaurant, they are in the hospitality industry and probably shouldn't have yelled at one of their customers for being sick. They also shouldn't have assumed that he was drunk/hungover. And speaking about him infront of everyone, not knowing that I was with him was extremely rude.\n\nI have always raved about this place. But i am so put off by their behavior over the weekend that I wont be returning and don't intend on ever telling anyone else to go here. while I do apologize to them for the unfortunate incident that happened at the restaurant, I do believe that their behavior was absolutely unacceptable.",

    "text": "I've never thought Fulin's was that bad...until today.   \nThe menu's are DISGUSTINGLY sticky and in need of wiping down.   The window by table looks like two year olds rubbed their dirty hands all over it.   Our waitress attire looks like she never washes it...by the way she's served us before with dirty clothing so it's her mojo.  The first two sushi's were okay but something seemed to be lacking in taste and the presentation was... nothing...usually sushi is presented quite beautifully.  \nBut we ate it and wondered if we were ruined since we had sushi at a new place in Murfreesboro that was over the TOP delicious and fresh.   So we went on and ordered a third sushi.   The waitress served us the third sushi with the oddest hesitation...the sushi looked awful.  The menu never said the seaweed paper was on the outside.  It said it was served with avocado and one tiny piece of avocado was on ONE slice.  It was suppose to have Roe and it was nowhere to be found.  So we got the menu and proceeded to complain to the waitress as we felt it wasn't clearly explained what we were getting.  I honestly now wonder if the other two sushi's were even prepared correctly.   I had tasted one bite of the scallops sprinkled over the top and it was sooooooo dried out and disgusting.   My husband tried a slice of the roll.  He doesn't like seaweed on the outside to begin with but he said he's had better at the grocery stores (which is usually very bad).  So that's how low this place has gone.   Fulin's need a serious makeover and management that wants to serve good food.   You've lost two customers.",

I might be the TT Duke on Yelp with more check-ins here than anyone, but that will likely change.  I rated this place a four star a couple weeks after opening, but it has gone down hill, a lot.\n\nWith the last ten visits, service and quality has gone down so much, I might never return.\n\nLet's start with product quality.  In the last five visits I have had a stale cone three times...the once perfect cone shape is now nothing but a swirled ice cream mess pressed into the cone and leaning to the side....and several times the sugar cone leaked from the bottom.\n\nThen there is service, or lack thereof.  My only complaint at opening was slow service.  I thought service could not get slower, but it has.  \n\nI fully support giving young adults the opportunity to work, but the culture at this restaurant lacks any customer care.  They seem more interested in socializing with friends at the window or their very exotic fingernails, than they are about customers.  And, the managers lack any empathy or ability to resolve these problems.\n\nSo...Back to TCBY for now...",

How can you ask customer if they want a doggy bag if they are still eating.   I understand people are waiting, but we just started to eat around 5:50 when food came out. How are they expect us to finish our food in 30 minutes and leave? Don't we have time to enjoy our dinner?  They should not have  booked  so many customers if they cannot handle.\nNo more Ooka for us!!",

    "text": "I went to Prep and Pastry about a week ago with my girlfriend. We were expecting a long line as other reviews said there would be on the weekend. When we arrived we were told that there would be a 30 minute wait. So we stood outside in the sun. After about 5 minutes, I asked one of the hostesses if there was a shorter wait time if we sat outside under the shaded patio. She promptly told me that the patio was closed due to a large party renting it out. Not 5 minutes later they seated a table of 3 at one of the 5 empty tables out there. Needless to say I was pretty upset about being blatantly lied to. After another 20 minutes of standing around we were finally seated. The building is visually appealing inside however it was so loud we couldn't even hear each other. My girlfriend ordered the A.M. Chile Relleno, and I ordered the tri tip sliders. We also ordered a french toast to split. The french toast was delicious, the tri tip sliders had no salt what so ever. And my girlfriends dish was absolutely cold. She ended up sending it back. They prepared a new one for her which also contained all but one morsel of salt. They did however take half off her dish for their incompetence. All in all Prep and Pastry is visited by people who want to be more hip than enjoy good food.",

They were also offering a spa package, which was a plus. I booked 2 nights in order to get the spa package. When I arrived I was told my room wasn't ready, so I went to the casino and played some slots (which were so tight as to be almost comedic). I finally got up to the 7th floor where my room was, and when I opened the door thought I was walking into a giant ashtray. The hallways reeked, but I thought maybe the rooms would be better. They are not. You cannot open a window either, not even a crack, to emit fresh air. The AC itself was merrily blowing a nonstop stream of what appeared to be straight cigarette smoke. I shut it off completely. When I called down to the front desk I was treated rudely, and I informed them there was NO way I could stay 2 nights in the giant ashtray room. I'm now waiting to see if they charge me for the spa that I am also not going to be able to go to.  The room was also nasty and dirty. For your pleasure I snapped a couple of pictures. The beds smelled as though the previous occupants bathed in Drakkor Noir. The cherry on top was at 03:30 an impassioned Mexican couple in the room next to mine had sex for 2 hours. I learned Spanish words I had never even heard before. How this glorified Holiday Inn ever got \"4 stars\" is beyond me. It's reeks, is filthy and the staff is rude.",

Not too big a deal, but then my daughter's chicken enchilada...had no chicken. We'd already begun eating, and our waiter hadn't come around to see if everything was OK. I asked her if she wanted to send it back but she said no, so, fine. The food itself was OK. We were hungry, we ate it. Her kid's meal was around $6.50, my crispy tacos $7.50, and my soda was $2. I noticed the prices on the menu, but wasn't adding up my bill ahead of time or anything because that's, you know, the restaurant's job. So I didn't blink when a check totaling $22.51 came, and I didn't pay any mind about tipping %20 (despite the faults, I've been a server before, so I can understand). In the end I paid $28. It was after we were long gone that I realized the total Should have been closer to $16, not $22.51. Did I get the wrong check and not notice? Did they add gratuity to a teeny little party of two without even telling me? Either way, that's a big no-no, right?  I wasn't being on my toes I guess, but I still feel a little ripped off. Ultimately they received more money than I personally thought the whole experience was worth, hence my poor star rating. Oh, and my butt was on fire all the next day, so there.",

We were offered free drinks as consolation which was nice but the waiting didn't end there. The waitress took forever taking our order and the food took about 30 minutes to arrive after ordering. Food finally came and there was nothing exciting about it. Blonde Benedict: eggs were so undercooked they were clear and fruit was underripe at best.

    "text": "This is the first restaurant review I have ever written but, this place was such a disappointment that I would like to save someone else from wasting their money and time on Ho Ho's like we did. First, I will start off with the positive. The Crab Rangoon was good and they were large. Sadly, that is the only nice thing I have to say. We ordered our food and the person I was with ordered extra pork with his fried rice and asked how much the extra pork cost and how much pork would he get. The young lady's response was, \"not very much\". He made a circle with his hand and asked if that was how much or more and she looked horrified and continued to say, \"not very much\". He went ahead and ordered it with an extra cost of $2.00 which is (2) extra portions of pork. There were 3 dirty bikes and 2 filthy high chairs in the VERY dated dining room. We pulled our chairs out and they were so dirty our hands were sticking to the chairs. We noticed the packets of sugar were from Ameristar and the sugar free packets were from another restaurant. Our drinks came in cracked plastic cups that still had the price tag sticker on the bottoms of them and the ice was out of a regular freezer and you could taste that it was old ice. It took forever to get our food. He ordered a Pork St. Paul Sandwich which came on the tiniest slices of bread with very old, dry pork. Until then, I thought all bread slices were the same size. I ordered Chicken Lo Mein and the chicken was horrible! It didn't even taste like chicken.The lo mein was spaghetti and there was so much soy sauce that it was soup. I asked for red sweet and sour sauce and the girl brought it out in and old honey container and the container was very sticky. Not from the sweet and sour spilling on it but, it was as if it had been sitting on a shelf by a fryer. There were big chunks of something in it. Finally, the person I was with got their fried rice to go that was supposed to have 2 extra servings of pork yet, it still fit into the usual small container and there was no extra pork. At that point, we just wanted out of there. I have been disappointed in restaurants but, this place made me angry. It was a COMPLETE waste of money and they obviously take no pride in the making of their food. The quality of the food or experience very clearly means nothing to the owners of this restaurant. If you see it-KEEP DRIVING!!!!!!",

    "text": "I had a Friday night business dinner scheduled elsewhere, but we couldn't get a table until after 9:30pm so we decided to try Timpano. Had no problem getting in & now I know why.\nWe had one of the worst meals & I spent almost $180.00.\nWe sat outside, which was charming, except  we felt  lucky when the waiter showed up at our table. He was rushed & apologized for the lack of wine choices.\nThe bread was wonderful...\nThe Osso buco was hard, dry & so salty it was inedible.\nSent that back, the waiter was nice about it, brought back the Scallop dish which was still oversalted &  really bad. \nThe side of grilled, Burnt, slimy asparagus was also salty & over cooked. And I truly wanted to send it back because it was horrible....did I mention cold?\nBut we were starting to get in a hurry to leave so we could wash out the bad taste in our mouth.\n\nMy chicken dish was better than a microwave one from Big Lots, but the chicken was chewy, rubbery, 4 sure Not Organic, Farm Raised... Must be steroid chicken , no taste, and I cannot remember the name of the dish, I believe it had a few morsels of pasta with it.  Ughh...\n\nThe 1 star is for our waiter , he was OK, but I am SO OVER egoist, affected, waiters telling me about their view on wine, when they obviously have NO clue.\nI mention a Gaja Barberesco & he suggests the Amarone. And he continued with a Soliloquy on all the names of Top Italian Wines he knew & 10 minutes go by &  Guess what, they did not offer 1 of the them on their wine list!  So he wastes time trying to show me He Knows wine's names, but Timpanodoes not carry them.\n The Beat thing I orderes was the cocktail I had in the beginning with Elderflower liquor, a splash of soda muddled mint &  cucumber. That was so refreshing.\n My associate polished most of the Wine choice off her self. Which was good and was priced ok, I think the bottle was around $40.00. \nTheir wine list is minimal.\n We expected an Italian Restaurant but it was more a New York Steak House.The food was ordinary, over salty, waaay over priced. And don't get me started on the Duo they booked 4 entertainment...\nBottom line, That area of Hyde Parkis in construction & renovation so STAY AWAY. Wait 4 Goody Goody 2 open! That is something that I hear will be worth the parking hassle!",

We got there and sat for over an hour. We would have left but it was late and we were out for a friend's birthday. The food was ok but everything was way too salty. To top off our fabulous night the owner, Ken, kept coming into our room and pretty much was trying to flirt and hug everyone. He was very drunk and incoherent. Please go with  men if you do want to eat here. Oh and the place needs to be cleaned up because it was very dirty especially the bathroom.",

I peeled apart the two layers to see how much chicken was not there, and there was a piece of red plastic in the midst of the cheese. The red plastic seemed to be the plastics that tie off bread packages. I was offered no compensation for my meal and there was an obvious lack of sincereity in the waitresses's apology. I have been a big Chateau costumer and have been for years. I was very disappointed in the services here.",

    "text": "We have been going there almost weekly, my wife loves the shrimp and crab legs.  Personally I like the crab legs.  We took the family out this past weekend, and were severely disappointed.  At first it seemed like it was going to be a great experience with the family.  The salads came out, I had to ask about my bisque.  It finally arrived after the reset of the table had finished their salads.  While I was eating my bisque the food came out.  My wife and I ordered crab legs with two premium sides each, instead of the regular sides that came with it.  Big mistake, she kept asking if we wanted the corn and potatoes or the rice and broccoli.  We wanted neither, my wife wanted lobster mashed and I wanted the aspagaras and burbon sweet potatoes.  We received the crab legs and the rice.  We told the person who brought the food out that is not what we ordered.  After we finished the crab legs , the sides finally arrived.  The manager did comp my wifes meal, but not mine.  Did not care about the meal being comp'd, but service has really gone down hill.  Of course we did not have our usual server either.",

Stains cover the once colorful floors. Dirt and grime on every wall, entry way and door! \n\nWe ordered 2 large pizzas, buffalo chicken breadsticks and 5 sodas... $78 WITH COUPONS! Holy crud! We could've got a feast at Peter Piper Pizza! Oh and the pizza.....it's awful! Frozen pizza blows this place out of the water! I'm waiting for my dad to regurgitate his salad from the salad bar. It's definitely been sitting out all day, all the toppings are mixed together and everything is shriveled up and dried out. \n\nThis location is building a new location directly across the street. I really hope that it will come with a new manager and new cleaning crew! What a terrible experience for my daughter on her birthday! \n\nThe only good thing about this place is the staff!  They take pride in their work. VERY friendly and upbeat!",

The Garlic Knots were alright, and their pizza may be good, as I haven't had any I can't comment. What I can say is that there pasta sucks, the meatballs taste like they just bought them at a store and stuck them on top, and they used almost no pasta sauce, like 3 cups per 10 lbs of pasta. Wouldn't eat it even though it was free, certainly wouldn't spend any money there.",

I had to get the manager to get served. \nThe hibachi chef was one of the least skilled that I have ever seen.  One in our party ordered filet mignon.  He cooked all the dinners at our table, then after he served everyone realized that he hadn't cooked the filet, cooked it and gave it to the wrong person.  My friend didn't realize the mistake.

Found my self trying to avoid it. Tasted a little like it may have been cured/dried on the manifold of one of their delivery cars. Not sure how or when it was cooked, but it was neither fresh nor good. \n\nBecause I was too cheap to leave. I kept eating.

They sell them by the box. -Do yourself a favor, buy a box of chips, take them home and melt some shredded cheese on them. Then take a couple handfuls of the chips and crunch them into pieces on your bedsheets. -you'll have a overall better experience. \n\nWent to my car and used hand sanitizer as mouth wash. \n\nOh, and dude in the skullcap couldn't make eye contact.

This last time was the worst experience I have had thus far.  I ordered food to go and they said it would be 15-20 min.  The food took 45 minutes. They left out my guacamole and a chicken taco.  I also ordered the steak and bean quesadilla which had no beans on it, no lettuce, sour cream, pico or guacamole, and also had a hair in it.  When I called to complain the manager was unapologetic and only offered a refund if I was willing to \"take the food back\" when I was already across town.  I did not expect a full refund but the least they could do is apologize and offer to refund the quesadilla and the guacamole and chicken taco that were left out of the order. I was mostly upset by the fact that I wanted to love this place.  I really tried but I will not be back.",

    "text": "My wife and I dined at TJ's tonight for date night and were extremely disappointed,  disappointed on many levels.  One level being the service (server 7021 on the receipt), she should never serve again.  She spoke like we were an inconvenience to her, never told us her name, and had a demeanor as if she did not care about anything.  She was short with every response and uneducated on the menu, she did not even ask how our food was that we barely touched.  Second the food was terrible.  We had ordered the calamari as an appetizer, way under seasoned, red sauce was bland and tasted like canned marinara.  I had dumped one cap full of table salt(probably 1/8 tsp) from the salt shaker into our 2 oz portion of red sauce and it barely helped.  Calamari tasted just like fryer oil with no seasoning in the flour.  I had the sausage Parmesan sub and my wife had the meatball Parmesan sub.  Terrible choices.  Meatballs tasted like a frozen product, with canned marinara sauce.  My wife ate 1/4 of her meal and set it aside.  The sausage Parmesan was even worse.  Sliced Italian sausage with, maybe peppers covered with slopped sauce and cheese, on the best part of the entire meal, the bread. When we picked up our subs they immediately fell through the bread onto the plate.  Annoying to all sandwich lovers.  Oh, the beer battered onion rings, awful.  Nothing else to say about those other than we ate 2.  Server 7021 never asked us is everything was okay, or if we enjoyed the meal and clearly from the almost full portions of food that we denied to go boxes for didn't send a message, I do not know what else would.  My wife and I will never return to TJ's nor recommend this to anyone.  This was the worst $56 I have ever spent on food.",

Plus the check came to $180 with 18% tip included and i explained i needed to charge a certain amount in cards and the rest in cash, i even wrote the amounts and card numbers on the ticket but after waiting a long time for her to bring the change she didnt bring any change and overcharged the cards. A total of $210 dlls instead of $180 she was charging more than $50dlls in tip. Thats an abuse. Im very very dissapointed and her only excuse was that she was too busy.",

    "text": "Boy, how things have changed in a year since my first very positive review from last July.  The movie theater next door was condemned and Bailey's has followed suit.  The food is of poor quality and overpriced.  I ordered a specialty salad and it took 45 minutes and was missing the avocado, egg, and cheese when it finally arrived; items which they don't carry anymore but haven't updated the menu or told the waitresses about.  The chocolate cake with ice cream arrived after 45 minutes with the ice cream fully melted.  All still charged full premium price for.  The restaurant also sponsors Superbowl parties for which we reserved a $100 table, drink, and appetizer package which was not worth the price; a St. Patrick's Day party, and Cinco De Mayo celebration as well as many others at which you are encoured to drink, drink, and drink the specials.  However when you try to be responsible and need to get a taxi/cab home the Management and workers have said on more than one occassion that \"it's not their problem and taxis won't come out to their location\".  That's totally irresponsible.  Used to be a good place but now I'm ASHAMED to invite any friends there or take my wife out for dinner and drinks.  I'll spend my $100 a week elsewere.  The nearby Logan's Roadhouse O'Charleys, and Outback Steakhouse are much better choices and values and you won't have Coal Miner's lung after one night of the poor ventilation.",

    "text": "Deplorable. This is how I would describe the customer service at the Gaylord Opryland Hotel and Convention Center. \n\nI will start upon arriving at the facility: The valet staff should probably wear smiles and act as if we as guests are not an inconvenience. After all, this is there job. Easily dismissed though as everyone can have a less than great day. It was also 1:00AM local time. \n\nUpon entering the hotel (I refuse to refer to it as a resort which I'll explain later) I was awestruck by the beauty of the lobby and the gardens at the opposite end. This is of course where the pleasurable experience stopped, abruptly. Upon check in we were rudely greeted by a gentleman telling me my room rate was incorrect and it would be $100 higher than my reservation. Despite it being late, I calmly asked why the discrepancy? He couldn't advise me of a straight answer and of course no management staff was available. I had asked for other facilities in the area to which I was informed they were all booked. I'm curious as to know how he knew such a thing! Reluctantly, I checked in and was immediately billed $100 more per night for 3 nights, 3 days worth of parking at $23/day and an $18/day resort fee. Surprise!! I didn't have a choice in the matter because they hit my card with all of it right then and there. I advised him I would be speaking with a manager the following morning. Surprise again! No manager was available all 3 days! \n\nI left the front desk to find our room. And it was the worst hunt I had ever been on in my life. It took 30 minutes to find the room and the little river that runs through the atrium smelled something horrible. After wandering through the jungle we emerged in the Delta Region. I think that is somewhere in South Africa, but I'm unsure. Onto the next adventure! We were told 1 room number but our keys said another. Since I was advised verbally, we chose that one. Keys didn't work. Tried the one on the card and voil\u00e0, the doors opened: to a horribly small room with 2 double beds which had a peculiar odor to it. Now for the luggage. We used the \"Consider it Done\" button on the phone (which by the way I believe it said Consider it Done OUR Way, but I could be mistaken). The bellhop brought the luggage 25 minutes later. I think he got lost too. It's now 2:00AM and time to hit the hay and see Nashville! \n\nAt 8:30AM someone is brutally banging on our door. By the nature of the banging I would have thought it to be the Feds! Apparently Housekeeping doesn't pay attention to the little guitar shaped \"Do Not Disturb\" card. I'm awake now...and I want coffee! The coffee maker doesn't work. The iron didn't work. Ok. There's a cafe somewhere amongst the foliage! I saw it marked on the map. They should probably include a legend on said map. $8 for an overpriced knockoff Starbucks, but ok, it's Nashville and a local tourist trap. \n\nI'm going to fast-forward a little as to not make this much longer. Despite the pools not being open when they say they are, the restaurants being more expensive than those in airports and with mediocre food at best, being kicked out of the pizza place they had inside 10 minutes before closing and our room had an amazing view of dumpsters with the glorious rolling landscape of a parking lot, it was a nice place! The only saving grace were the gardens themselves. But you can view them without having to pay for a room! \n\nNow for the really fun part: Contacting Marriott Customer Care about the horrible visit. (The hotel won't call you back otherwise.) Customer Care advised me they would forward my grievance to the hotel and I should expect a response in 3-5 business days. I forwarded everything I could think of including my original reservation, costs, incorrect information and of course the issues we had while staying there. \n\nI was eventually contacted by a Heather Gates who is the Assistant Front End Manager. She informed me she was sorry for the way we were treated but they would not do anything to rectify the bill. That's the way it was. I contacted Marriott Customer Care again and copied Heather on this email. I was then phoned by John Bennefield, the Front End Manager who informed me the exact same thing as Heather \"Sorry, but you're stuck with that bill.\" Furthermore he refused to give me the hotel manager's name, phone or email. Instead I was informed of his 15 years with the company and this was his 8th hotel! From working in a large company, when someone was transferred so frequently, we called it \"Passing the Trash\". It definitely wasn't due to pride of service. John was exceptionally rude and went on to belittle me for making such a huge deal and contacting customer care over a mere $300. To me, that's reasonably substantial. I was also informed directly that \"The Marriott considers this matter closed. It ends here and there's nothing more anyone will do.\" I had asked for the hotel managers number, name or email to which he told me \"you can find it online\".",

Again, I am obviously in the minority with my opinion, so maybe my taste buds are just broken, but I was not impressed.",

Maybe it's because we had such great meals everywhere else while we were in Nola, but every single part of our meal was a disappointment.  The service was ok... a bit slow, and not terribly friendly.  I had a PoBoy which was just... lousy, and my wife doesn't even remember what she has (not because we had been drinking; he hadn't.  Just because it was terribly forgettable.)  \n\nThere are many other FAR-BETTER places to eat while you're in Nola, so please take your money there instead.  If you are considering Cafe Pontabla, INSTEAD, go down the street to 1109 Decatur and eat at Coop's Place, which is a much better restaurant with great food and great atmosphere!",

They don't employ enough people to handle a full house on a Friday night. As far as I can tell, there is no service at your table. As a result, you have to go to the bar to get your beers. This usually results in waiting anywhere from 5 to 10 minutes for someone to finally take you order. God forbid you can't belly right up to the bar because if you are even one level away, they won't see you. They obviously haven't been trained to look beyond the bar for patrons wanting a drink. \nTo make matters worse, the head brewer is usually there helping himself to the tap and serving his friends. Who the hell runs this place?\nThe beer was good enough. I especially liked the Mac Daddy Scottish Ale. It was clean and malty, just as a Scottish Ale should be. The Danny Boy Black was also good. They have a ton of guest taps and the selection was good.\nThe beer might be decent, but there are plenty of places to get good beer. I'll be going elsewhere.",

They have toppings for it, however without being mentioned on the menu, you'd never know it. I used to love their hawaiian burger and mushroom burger. GREAT... I mean GREAT burgers.

She asked again, and it didn't arrive. She asked a third time, and out of spite the server Andrew shoved 2 entire containers full of sweeteners. Like she needed 2 of them.

Needless to say, I ignored the signs and ate here.  This was literally the worst Thai food I have had in my entire life.  \n\nFirst, I ordered the tom yum soup.  They asked me how spicy I wanted it and I responded that I wanted it spicy.  I did not expect that the entire bowl of soup would be covered in red pepper flakes.  Disgusting. I spent ten minutes picking red pepper flakes out of the soup and my mouth.  \n\n  I also tried the chicken satay.  The chicken was ice cold and as dry as beef jerky. The dipping sauce was a mix between curry and Planter's honey roasted peanuts.  It was a bizarre combination like nothing I've ever had before.  Once again...Disgusting. \n\n  Finally, I ordered curry.  I had high hopes that they could not screw up everything in my order.  Boy was I wrong.  The curry was bland and just plain gross. \n\nOverall, all 8 of the people in my group left the restaurant dissatisfied. My recommendation is that you walk two blocks down the road and eat at the Blue Elephant Thai Restaurant.",

Just chopped chicken that was grilled or fried. The meat itself was dry and tasteless. You cannot get a worse specimen of the dish.\n\nService :\nTerrible - the restaurant was Empty and yet everything took way too long. It took about 10 minutes just to get our drinks - iced tea...\n\nThe staff appeared to be on drugs - dazed and clueless.\n\nThe check:\nArrived with 18% gratuity tacked on. Turns out that on one of the back pages of the menu - the desert menu there is a notice that parties 6 and above will be charged automatically. This statement must appear on every page of the menu... \n\nThe owner:\nThe real problem is that we were a party of 5... That did not prevent the despicable owner of the restaurant to instruct the server to apply the automatic tip.\n\nWhen confronted, instead of apologizing and offering to refund the tip, he showed us the door poetically telling us that customers are like birds, they come and go, makes no difference to him.\n\nSo, you decide if such a loathsome human being deserves your business. There are plenty of other Mediterranean restaurants in the area that serve better food, have much better service, and don't steal from their customers.",

Then I asked to use the restroom. \n\nI poked my head in the kitchen and asked the brothers where it was. The chef brother told me I was interrupting him and his brother and that the only place I was allowed to talk to my server was on the floor. I thought he was kidding and the server brother sent me to the restroom. \n\nI came back from the restroom and the chef brother stopped me as I passed the kitchen to tell me that I was never allowed to come near his kitchen and that I needed to get the hell out of his restaurant. I told him I would be happy to leave since he was obviously insane. \n\nThe server brother came back to ask to the kitchen to investigate why the chef brother was yelling at a customer. As we left I heard the brothers going at it again. \n\nThe service was terrible. Because the brothers were having a bad day it was literally impossible for our table to complete placing an order without our server walking away while someone was speaking. We waited at least 15 minutes to place an order while watching the brothers argue in the door to the kitchen. \n\nThe food we got, bread and either whipped butter in a dish of oil, was revolting. Primarily because none of us could figure out if it was whipped butter or some sort of soft cheese. \n\nIt's obvious this is not the first time there two have had these kinds of arguments in their restaurant with customers present based on how easily they engaged in their unprofessional behavior. It's also obvious by how the chef brother treated me that I am not the first customer he has blown up at for no reason. \n\nThe relationship between these brothers and their inability to maintain professionalism is going to bring this restaurant down. You simply can't treat customers, or co-workers, the way they treat them.",

I am writing this review even before I head to the restaurant for dinner tonight and believe me when I say this, that I would never end up eating here if the majority of the birthday girl's party did not insist on eating at Han Dynasty just because she likes the food.\u00a0\n\n\nIt takes 2 phone calls and talking to 3 people to get a reservation at this restaurant, that itself is a turn off. The first lady I speak to is flat out rude when I call asking to make a dinner reservation for tonight \"We're all booked for tonight and not giving out any reservations\" she says before hanging up on me. I call back and a second lady answers and I say I need a reservation for 15 people at 9:30 and she asks for how long? WTF??? \"For however long it takes 15 adults to get done with dinner that's how long\" She responds saying they close at 10PM and the lady has no clue what day it is and they are open later on Friday's and finally agrees to give me a reservation.\u00a0\n\n\nIt is absolutely appalling when people working in the hospitality industry are rude. If you can't be courteous to your guests consider a different profession. I understand you are in the university city area and have to, more often that you like, deal with students but that by no means is an excuse for ill-treating your guests.\u00a0\n\n\nIf you expect a 20% tip from anyone they expect to be given a good experience right from the time they call you to make a reservation.",

Their employees are always too high to function, they have a hard time remembering orders and constantly leave things either at the store or in their car. I ordered from Hungry Howie's on Pantano last night, it literally took an hour for the food to get here and then he forgot the drinks and the garlic sauce. He had to go back to the store to get it which literally took about 15 to 20 minutes so by the time our drinks got here we were already done eating. And another thing, do not use their split technique online, I split my payment between my debit card and cash and it put it all on my debit card. The delivery driver didn't even have me sign the receipt so I didn't realize that it was paid in full until I looked at my receipt. I literally complained about the service and this delivery driver thought that I gave him a $13 tip, didn't even say anything. I go in today to get my $10 back, because I only meant for him to have a $3 tip because his service sucked, and they're only excuse was, I'm sorry he's new. So you don't train your new guys to have the customers sign the receipt when they use a card? Because if he had, this whole ordeal would have been avoided.

I ordered a dish and my friend was with me, the older woman who helped us BARELY spoke english and even though my friend did not want anything, she put him down for an order of something else on the menu! Then she was unable to understand that I WOULD NOT PAY for that, so she charged me ANYWAY without telling me. So i paid for 2 meals. One of which I DID NOT EVEN CONSUME! STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE! There are so many better latin cuisine options, i don't know why this place is STILL in existence!!!",

    "text": "I came for a conference. The total charge for my three night stay was over $1100 after taxes and resort fees. Even after paying this astronomical amount was I was still charged $8 for a microwaved breakfast sandwich and $16 for a small tube of neosporin. Lets not even talk about the restaurant prices. Lunch at the cafe for two- just ordering 3 small tapas plates (1 California roll was $12!!!!) and 2 alcoholic beverage each was a whopping $70 (not including tip). The resort was INCREDIBLY difficult to navigate and it took me and my coworkers over 20 min to find our rooms. There were limited breakfast options and the grab and go options had massive lines due to being understaffed. Even the shuttle to the airport was not complimentary. Taxis to downtown Nashville were $30 each way. Rooms were clean but needed to be checked better. I had no room service menu, the iron was cheap and leaked water right out of the holes (they brought me a brand new one and it did the same thing)- ruined a dress of mine. Lamp with appliance plugs was broken. I could hear screaming kids up to 11pm at night. I didn't even know how to get to the atrium outside my room. I felt trapped in a biosphere and would never return willingly to this place again. Overall, it completely overpriced and not a relaxing stay at all. For a \"world class resort\" here in the United States it pretty shameful. I've had a completely better stay at resorts in other countries that are 1/2 the price, go there instead!!!!!",

My stuffed french toast was not cooked all the way through, and my fiance's breakfast sandwich was a mess.  I was also frustrated that my meal was served with imitation maple syrup in a plastic cup, considering our meal was $30 dollars before tip (you can add real maple syrup for $2, lol).  The hash browns were just terrible, they were slimy and tasted a month old.  The food was almost as good as a quality diner, but not quite.  The space is charming, but it seems like they have far more tables than the kitchen can keep up with.  We sat near the kitchen door and during our lengthy stay you could see the kitchen staff was barely keeping things together.  It's a shame to see a small kitchen working so hard with no hope of getting out of the weeds. The army of servers was very friendly and took our order promptly.  We had high hopes for Blue Plate, but have to say we won't return and wouldn't recommend it to others.",

The parking lot was full but we did not see a line or anything to look like there was a wait. When we walked inside the music downstairs was so loud it sounded like a Salsa club. There was no host to greet us. Finally a man came up to us and told us they were booked for the night and that there was \"going to be a long wait\". Uh okay... He did mention we were welcomed to sit at the end of the bar if we wanted to. Who wants to eat a nice dinner at the end of a bar? \n\nWe will not be back to try to eat here.",

    "text": "The only reason for one star is it is the only way the review would post. We had long ago decided not to return to the Avon location after three disappointing visits. We frequented the Lafayette location often and were very disappointed in the service and quality of the Avon location where we now reside.  Tonight we followed our daughter and her family to the Avon location (unaware of where they had decided to go for dinner). This evening topped  the list of terrible restaurant experiences-over an hour wait for food, my daughters steak was cooked well done when ordered medium rare, the steak was remade which had to be boxed and was left at the table because was still cooked incorrectly.  She was charged 9.99 for the remake and that is what was taken off her bill not the price of the original steak&rib dinner.  I ordered the apple pie desert with ice cream which came out before we even received our drinks and without a spoon.  My husband drove back to the location where the manager refused to do anything different about the original charge for the incorrectly cooked steak; needless to say my husband left with the owners phone number.  Mistakes happen - but own them; every bad experience is related to over 20 people, who then in turn, repeat to someone else - so tell me manager of Avon, IN Texas Roadhouse - was it worth it?",

    "text": "So I was really excited to try this place, and before I start this review let me acknowledge that yes, I do realize that we chose to try this place out for the 1st tim on  Cinco de Mayo, and I probably could expect slower than usual service at a Mexican restaurant, but I also might counter that with it being Cinco de Mayo, that a popular Mexican restaurant should know enough to have proper staffing. And let me also point out, that of all of the many Mexican restaurants in the Fountain Square area, they were by far the least crowded that night. \n\nOkay so with that out-of-the-way, my wife and I walked in, walked through the front area, through the middle bar, to the back outdoor tiki bar area. And while it was crowded, as I would've expected it would be, there was no standing room only, or people waiting for tables, in fact we found an empty table almost immediately.  We were encouraged, but we probably should have listened to the couple next to us who told us they sure hope we weren't planning on eating there, because they had been there for an hour and were still waiting on their food.  We were approached almost immedietly by a server who took our drink orders.  That had to be a good sign, right!  Well, our drinks took about 20 mins..ok so it's Cinco de Mayo, no big deal.  We figured we had better get our food order in.  Pretty simple order, chips and questo, and two tacos each.  Nothing special.  After about 45 mins and no sign of even our chips, I walked up to bar in front area and ordered chips and queso and 2 more drinks.  He got that all for me in about 5 mins.  I asked him if I could order a couple of tacos and he told me the kitchen was closed.  I told him we placed our order about 45 mins ago and he assured me we would get our food and it was only  closed for new orders.  Took our drinks and chips and queso back outside to tiki bar and relaxed for a while.  \n\nAnother 45 mins later and still no food.  We grabbed our waitress and she said she would check.  She came back about 30 mins later and informed us that our order was the last one the kitchen had accepted but they dropped our ticket on the floor and never made our tacos and were now out of everything.  Two hours and no food.  We asked to speak to manager but he/she was not available.  To cap it all off she still charged us for the two drinks we had ordered almost 2 hours ago.  I see that this place is highly reviewed by most for the food, but I doubt we will go back, and if they dont fix their service and management issues, I doubt this place will be around for very long!",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I were looking for some good Mexican food for his birthday, and since I missed the boat on getting a reservation at El Vez I figured we would give this a try. The reviews seemed okay and everyone said that the drinks were really good. \n\nNot at all true....\n\nTo start with, we ordered the guacamole. I have had a lot of different kinds and make it myself at home, and this was incredibly bland with not a lot of flavor.  I ordered the Carnitas Tacos and my boyfriend got the Brisket Tacos (special of the day). They were all right, but the waiter told us right off the bat he would recommend a side since they were small portions.  We didn't end up eating any of our side since they were so big, we each only finished two tacos! \n\nThe most disappointing part of this whole experience was the drinks.  I got the Classic Mojito (which I have also had and made many times before) and he got the Mexican style Mojito, that apparently is with cilantro and tequilla instead of rum and mint.  The first batch were really delicious, so we ordered another round. Not at ALL the same drink.  They looked very different, but mainly they didn't taste at all similar.  Very very sweet and acidic, way too bitter.  We politely called the waiter over and asked if the bartender wouldn't mind remaking them since the first drinks we had were very different, and he obliged. A few seconds later the bartender came back and told us she remade the drinks but tasted them and they tasted exactly how they should be.  She was very condescending and rude (My boyfriend and I have both worked in customer service before...when customers are being polite in their complaints, there is no need to be rude back) and said she would make the drink for us 10 times if we wanted but it wouldn't be any different. She said that they first AMAZING drink we had must have been made wrong.  She kept asking us how they were different and we had trouble explaining to her exactly what to change, so we decided to let it go and asked for the check. Yes, we still got charged for the shitty drinks that we left on our table. \n\nFor a tequilla bar who is apparently known for their drinks, the inconsistency is frightening.  I was very disappointed in the entire experience, not what I was planning for the first birthday that my boyfriend and I spent together.",

Also, the computer/register was down so no drinks available from the bar. We offered to pay cash, but this was beyond their capacity and the request was met with silence. The courtyard was lovely though and the staff courteous. But it was such a disappointment on our first stop of our first day to New Orleans.",

    "text": "I was a huge fan of the old O'Briens with the dive bar atmosphere and friendly service. The new one however is absolutely terrible. Very few of the original staff remained on the payroll and the replacements are rude and just about worthless. To top it off they currently employ bouncers ( for whatever reason is unclear to me considering it is a calm, older crowd overall) and one of which has a Napoleon complex and makes your stay uncomfortable with his patrolling around and instigating problems so he can flex his tiny muscles. The food is decent if you're lucky enough to get the right order and assuming it's still hot when it gets to you. Also, the live bands they have are never good and the place is not rated for sound so all you hear is loud yelling and feedback and your only escape is to the sauna they call the outside bar where you can sweat and battle Mosquitos and watch the owner pound back drinks and make sexual comments to female patrons. Lastly there is no entertainment value. The TV's are not synced to speakers so you can't hear the game and the engineering genius put the dartboard where the waitresses have to walk back and forth to the bar so you're constantly being asked to move. I've given this place multiple chances and really wish I could say something positive but it really is a lot of hype, pricey, and a terrible spot to spend your time and money.",

Then this morning when an additional piece was detected as also needing to be replaced said I would have to pay $300  for labor on that part. Or $400 and they would upgrade original one they said would be free. Or I could use a different company but then I would be waiving warranty on other parts!

    "text": "Heed the warnings. Long lines, poor service, HORRIBLE food. I'm sorry, but everything we were served was just nasty. We had a 3 hour layover and I neglected to look at the reviews prior to us getting a table.\n\nWe passed by several tables on our way to our seats and everyone's food looked straight nasty. But we stuck it out and went on and ordered anyway. We started with some cheese sticks. These were so gross. When they arrived on our table, they were soaked with some kind of weird brown juice. I assume it was the oil they were fried in that looked like it was last changed prior to the Exxon-Valdez oil spill back in '89. Horrible, burnt, greasy, and very \"off\" flavor. Our table mate next to us ordered the ravioli bites, they were also covered in the brown oil grease and they didn't even eat 1/2 of them.\n\nOur pasta dishes were equally as disappointing and gross. I opted for the lasagna, and it was NASTY. The pasta itself was overcooked, which I can live with if bolstered by a decent sauce, quality/fresh meat, and good cheese. This lasagna offered NONE of these things. The sauce was the worst offender. Packed with sugar, it was a VERY SWEET, very thin red/marinara sauce. There were no spices or typical Italian seasonings, no garlic, no onion flavor, none of the deep, rich flavors that typically adorn good Italian-style food. The cheese was cheap and rubbery, and there was NO MEAT in the lasagna to speak of. Literally, I had NONE in my dish. It was absent, and sorely needed.\n\nDO NOT EAT HERE. You WILL regret it.",

    "text": "On Dec. 26, my wife and I had 6PM reservations at this restaurant... supposedly a more casual version of the mother restaurant, Galatoire's, right next door. We had intended to have take part in their Reveillon special... a fixed menu that many New Orleans restaurants run from Dec. 1st - 31st... we were pretty much dressed business casual... but I did have on black jeans... there is no dress code there, but we looked pretty good. My guess is the awful waitress thought we were tourists (we live less than 4 blocks away from the restaurant) and for some reason, she didn't want her table taken up by us... even though the place was pretty empty at the time... this witch of a waitress flat out lied to us, saying that Reveillon had ended on Christmas at their and all of the other restaurants... we were quite mystified but accepted it and left... ended up eating sushi at at little place on Decatur. \n\nAnyway, while planning our New Year's Eve, I had been looking through Nola.com and discovered that Reveillon was indeed still going at not only Galatoire's 33, but all the other restaurants. This despicable waitress (I wish I could remember her name) at this over-priced restaurant deserves to have its business go in the take... the laughable kicker in the whole situation... my wife is a best selling travel author (numerous travel guides to her name, including a best selling New Orleans guide for Moon Handbooks). Don't give you business to this snobby, greedy restaurant or its mother restaurant... don't support anyone that would lie to customers simply to keep their tables open for someone who would pay their high prices vs going with the fixed meal price of Reveillon... pathetic!",

Instead the manager charged me the full price and it came out to be $21.50. Big difference. I complained to the manager at the booth and she did nothing. I called the store later and spoke to Tim the manager on duty and explained it to him and he told me to call back on Monday. I call the store on Monday and spoked to the General Manager who happened to be the same person that was at the booth at the show and she said she would refund my money.

    "text": "Finally getting around to finishing this review...  This summarizes our visit on the night of Gasparilla.  \n\nThis was, without a doubt, the absolute the worst service ever. After waiting in line for 30 minutes to be seated, we sat for 30 MORE minutes w no waitress visit. Once we actually did get served and placed our order, the food never came.  When I walked up to the counter to check on the food.... the order was never put in. We were told to wait for 10 minutes   15 minutes later was told it was 5 more minutes. Once the food arrived, it was VERY good... but we had to take it home and eat it because it was past the children's bed times at that point.  Mind you, people who arrived after we were seated got their food, ate, and left before we even saw a slice of our order.  Nice.\n\nRecently I read a story that Cappy's has pretty much barred kids from the joint, citing misbehavior.  Well, given that on my one and only visit to the place the incredibly horrid service required my children to wait in excess of an hour and fifteen minutes to GET a pizza, this won't be an issue for me (although for once in their lives they were actually behaving despite the excessive wait).  \n\nWhile I am all for the supporting of local businesses (especially in the Seminole Heights area) and definitely see the appeal of a place like Cappy's (it is pretty cool inside, and had a nice vibe), my experience coupled with the anti-kids stuff I read pretty much sealed the deal for me.  I won't be going back, with or without kids.  Stephannos is right up the road, and they make a great pie without the drama.",

    "text": "My husband and I stopped here for lunch on a Saturday afternoon around 2-ish.  The restaurant was completely empty.  We inquired if they were even open and a nice lady said they were and proceeded to seat us.  \nTheir menu did not offer as many options of meat types or dishes as most Mexican restaurants do here in Indianapolis.  My husband ordered a margarita and the special of the day, Chilaquilles con salsa verde y pollo at $6.99 and I ordered a carne asada burrito at $7.99 and water to drink.\nChips and salsa were brought to the table.  Chips were  fried there, and while I like that style of chip (thin, often bubbles into thin layers) but were cold and very greasy.  Salsa was sweet but had some heat in the finish.  It was easy to eat a lot of those!\nWhen our meals came to the table, frankly, they were underwhelming.  My burrito tortilla looked/felt like it was not heated at all and cutting into my burrito was disappointing.  There was lots of lettuce and tomato, a scoop of a white rice (not spanish rice) and there was supposed to be mozzarella cheese in it but couldn't taste or see it.  The carne asada was thinner than a strip of bacon.  Unfortunately, I would be generous in saying there was maybe 2 ounces of beef.  In all honesty, there was no more meat in it than two strips of bacon, diced.  My husband mentioned it to the person (owner) with a quick \"sorry\" muttered and no offer to do anything.   While the combination of ingredients was not improperly prepared, there are 100 other Mexican restaurants in town I can spend $8.00 on a burrito and it would be generously filled with meat.\nAs for my husband's chilaquilles, I order this all the time from Biscuits in Broad Ripple and this was another disappointment.  This was chips, salsa verde, one fried egg and a very thin boneless piece of grilled chicken.  My husband felt as I did.  Not poorly prepared but completely lacking any substance.  During the time we spent in this restaurant, there was not one other customer coming or going.  With the lack of substance to the food, I suspect most people will feel as I did and would not waste their time coming back here.  There is no way this restaurant can survive when prices are the same as other Mexican restaurants but quality is far less.  Sadly, I was even mad that we spent $25.00 at this place and left just to drive to a fast food restaurant so we could get some quick, cheap protein.  \nI will chalk this up to a learning experience.  Folks, save your money and go to Rosita's or Margaritas U.S. 31, Leonardo's or even El Meson.",

The first two were pretty good - but the remainder were hard and I gave up.  \n\nThe ugly:   WORST.  BURGER.  EVER.  So, the bun and toppings seemed like they would be ok - even good - if not for being paired with the most tasteless piece of meat ever. It's a shame a place calling itself \"Burger Lane\" falls short on the burger.  Frankly it ruined the whole thing.  \n\nI don't see this place having much business if they don't improve quality.",

    "text": "They used to make an Amiga bowl that had an abundance of shredded grilled chicken on the bottom of a flour tortilla bowl, a layer of rice topped with grilled onions and peppers with a queso sauce drizzeled over the top.\nTonight there was no rice nor any shredded chicken, it had been replaced with chicken crisps. They are the outer parts of a grilled chicken breast with no moisture and very few of them.\nHaving met the owner in the past and having his wife wait on me I knew something wasn't right.\nI explained to the waitress that this dish had changed and wasn't good! She politely offered something else. What to order...if they had modified a basic dish what was next?\nTo my surprise a male manager came out and \"informed\" me that this is exactly what they had been serving for 10 years and I must have either special ordered something or was mistaken.\nI said this is not what they had served me for the past 5 years and I never had requested a special order before. \nI also asked what they had done to the phenominal soft tacos? They were usually served in a soft warm flour tortilla and had moisture and flavor. Tonight they were stale and crisp and the filing was bland.  Again he informed me I was mistaken while he held my order that had been sent back to the kitchen in front of me.\nI apologized and said I didn't wish for anything else, thank you.\nAnother manager came out a few moments later apologizing and stated that they are unfamiliar with what I had ordered and would \"special order\" anything I wanted. I declined.\nApparently their cook walked out tonight and they were winging it.\nToo bad it was a good place to get a good mexican meal.\nTwo thumbs down on Poblano's.",

    "text": "Stay away. My husband and I stopped here this afternoon to use a gift card given to us a long time ago. We do not normally buy cold stone ice cream, and we're pretty easy to please. All we were looking for was a nice cold treat on a hot day- what we got was a small ice cream that was way too sweet (yes, even for ice cream!), and a chocolate shake that was not good, for about $11. My husband took one sip of his shake and pushed it away. I took a taste and agreed that something was not right. It had a distinctly sour, bitter aftertaste. While I finished my ice cream, he debated about whether he wanted something else instead. Since the ingredients seemed to be the problem, he decided did not want something else, even though my ice cream seemed fine. When I took the shake back to the register and explained the problem, we were told we could not receive a refund, only a replacement. Both of us had an upset stomach for about two hours afterwards, and neither of us had more than a sip or two. Poor customer service, bad ingredients. Food poisoning is not worth $11, so we simply left.\n\nPoor customer service is my biggest pet peeve- as someone who has worked in customer service and international sales for four years, I promise you- it's really not THAT difficult of a task to make sure your customer is happy, even if there is a language/geographical barrier (today, there was neither). While I realize that the employee I spoke to is probably a minimum wage high school student, store policies that young woman has to follow are set by real adults. Whoever set the policies for this store clearly is not doing their job!\n\nShame on you, coldstone, for trying to give my (active-duty & a veteran) husband food poisoning on Memorial Day, and refusing to make any real attempt to make amends. Don't worry, you sure as hell won't see us again, ever. Fool me once....",

And then I just needed one more thing - some plastic cups for a little party I'm having this weekend. \n\nI go ahead and drop my stash on the counter, begin to extract several singles from my wallet, when the cashier looks at me and says, \"24.99.\"\n\nI respond, \"That's not right.\"\n\nHe points at a price tag on the plastic cups which reads 19.99. I begin laughing. I tell him the price is clearly wrong. He tells me he's got to talk to his manager. Meanwhile, I tell the folks behind me waiting in line that I'm just going to go run and get different plastic cups to hurry the process along. Before he got back from doing his price check, I already had another cashier ringing up my two sleeves of cups for 1.99 each. That's more like it.\n\nAt around that same moment, the first cashier comes back from his consultation with his manager. He tells me that the price was, in fact, incorrect. And that the price is actually 14.99.\n\nTHAT'S the unscrupulous part.\n\nCLEARLY, THAT price is also far too high. His manager did no actual price check at all. He simply told the cashier to pretend that the real price was actually 5 dollars less, thinking that I'd be stupid enough to accept this. Why, because I'm white, and you're a racially superior Indian? You think white people are stupid don't you? We'll just believe what you tell us, and fork over our money.",

    "text": "I applaud Gaylord Entertainment for trying to tie a restaurant in with the Opry, its a shame the food doesn't measure up with the Opry. I just had my one and only meal at the Backstage Grill.  I tried their Southern Buttermilk Fried Chicken and instead of corn and potatoes I had Coleslaw and Mac N Cheese. They claim their chicken is Iron Skillet fired, maybe it is, but it sure is cooked in advance, From the time my server took my order until it was delivered to my table wasn't more than 10 minutes, no way their cooking Laminate, their attempting to hold it and serve as the orders come in. The Coleslaw had a bitter note with a heavy hand on the celery seed. The Mac N Cheese was luke warm less than 100 degrees and wasn't a very complimentary blend of cheese's, it tasted strange. The chicken was luke warm, at best it was 100 degrees which spells their going to make someone sick holding food in the danger zone.  I mentioned the food issues to my server who took the plate away with an apology. He returned once again with a freshly plated meal and told me to be careful the plate was hot. \n\nOnce again the Mac N Cheese was not any warmer than the 1st plate and the chicken was just maybe a tad warmer, not piping hot as it should be. What little chicken I did eat had a off putting flavor and texture. The coating was both grainy on the palette and lacked any seasoning what so ever. I visit Nashville every year so I do  frequent good eating establishments, sad to say this is not one I will return to since I'm not interested in playing Culinary Russian Roulette.",

Yes McDonalds. I got a Woodstock and fries. The bun was about the size of a double cheeseburger bun at McDonalds, The meat really didn't have a taste to it, the bacon tasted like it was deep fried in two week old grease, and the fries seemed like were warmed up in the microwave. The \"homemade\" ketchup, not good either. Now, on to the service, I know these waitress's make low hourly wage and depend on tips, however, to get a tip you have to take care of your customers. I had to ask for coke, even though she walked by twice and looked at my empty glass ( I had already drank the melted ice) the third time she walked by I had to ask her even though she looked at the empty glass to bring me a coke. Then I asked for mayo Joe she said ok and then waited on another table. Maybe its just me but...The only smile I got was when I was leaving and then I bet she didn't smile when she picked up the receipt. I will not come back. And take heave, don't be like me. I am sorry for the long review, and I hope you have a great day.",

We love Yokohama but figured we would try a less expensive alternative. \n\nThe menu prices ranged from 16.95 for\nChicken to around 18.95 for other selections like steak.   Plus they offered a $15 coupon on their website.     Needless to say when we get there he's is a laminated piece of paper with all prices at\nLeast $6 more entree.  \n\nI brought it quietly to the managers attention and inquired.  I was told I had an old website and the manager showed me the new website on my phone and I said I understood.  I quickly looked at the new website and the prices were still much lower on the menu.   I showed the manager and she abruptly told me that those prices are for takeout.   Who orders takeout hibachi with soup, salad and rice anyway?  I quickly looked at the website again and there was actually a second tab for the regular hibachi menu vs. a tab for takeout and surprise......  prices were still more then 20% less than the plastic laminated bait and switch menu.  \n\nNow  she said it's all about the presentation at the restaurant ( that is what tips are for) and was still very rude.  I sat back down and when my family realized that the restaurant was fraudulent they chose to leave and go elsewhere.   I offered to pay for my son's coke and we left.  The \"customer is always right\" is surely not followed at Megu.   \n\nI think I would have just told a party that they would honor the menu prices rather than lose customers.  \n\nWe went to Yokohama and if I could give them 6 stars I would.

HOWEVER, we went last night to celebrate my brothers graduation and ALL of our seafood dishes had rotten shrimp in them. My brother is not very food conscious but even he pointed out that the shrimp had a bad taste. My mom and I tasted the shrimp from all the seafood dishes and had to spit it out. She told the waiter and sent back a few pieces for the chef to try, only for the waiter to come out and say that the chef didn't taste anything wrong with it and the best he could do was take 20% off our bill. We weren't looking to get any discounts, we were simply trying to make the staff aware of the rotten shrimp. My mom was mostly concerned about the chef's judgement. She has been in the restaurant industry for decades and was appalled when the chef said he didn't taste what was wrong. Those of us with seafood lost our appetite and left with our plates still full of food. Money and time wasted. Not sure if we will be returning, such a shame considering this was a staple restaurant for us :(",

I've had bad experiences recently going through the drive through here (rude staff, making me feel like I've inconvenienced them) but my most recent trip there trumped all of that. I took my little brother through the drive thru and as soon as I pulled up to the first window, the cashier was BLARING explicit-lyric rap music. I have never experienced something like this at any drive thru, let alone one in a nice community like Fishers. Anyway, she kept telling me that I ordered something that I did not, and I had to tell her several times that I just ordered the chicken nugget meal before she finally got it. I paid her and she gave me back the change. Once I pulled up to the window to get my food, a guy came up to the window and in a threatening way said \"you owe her a dollar\" like it was my fault that the cashier gave me incorrect change. I gave him the dollar and he took it and laughed and said \"he tryna play you.\" I will not return to this location until something changes. Not only is the service horrid, but I would not feel safe bringing my family inside the restaurant in fear that I would be threatened if the cashier gave me the wrong change.",

    "text": "Ok. I am not the type to complain, but I have been here twice and both times I have had terrible service at the bar. The first bartender served me but acted as if I was bothering him.  This second time, with a completely different bartender mind you, it was worse. I am not dressed like a street person or anything, and I am not pan-handling. But you would think that I was the way he acted. First, I sit at the bar and I am waiting for service. So, the bartender walks by me, pours a glass a water, turns in front of me, puts the water down, gives me some stupid half-grin then walks off. Not one audible word of greeting or a grunt passed between his lips. Then, he gets a menu, drops that down and walks off again! Not a sound. Is it me, but when a customer enters an eating establishment, shouldn't they be greeted in some manner?  Not looked at like \"why are you here. I have better things to do\"?  I am not looking for a royal salute or anything. Just \"Hey man, what can I get ya?\"  or something to that affect.   Anyway, I start to look at the drink and food menus. Then, a group of anywhere from 10-15 people come in behind me and say, to what looked like a manager, \"We don't want to eat, is it ok if we just have a few drinks at the bar?\". The manager says \"Sure.\" The guy then says, \"Can we get few beers down here\"? (paraphrasing). The bartender says \"Sure!\" and proceed to service this group, one-by-one, as they order drinks. Ok, fine technically, I was looking at the menu when this started. But still, he walked back and forth, right in front of me, for about 10-12 minutes. Not once did he say, \"Hey, just shout and I will get you something\", or \"Hey man, just give me a few minutes and I will be right with you\". Nothing!  It was obvious it was a big group, but I mean, he gave no acknowledgement to the fact that I was sitting there waiting! \n\nLong story short - after this 10-12 minutes of waiting, I just walked out and went somewhere else. Now this place has about 4\\5 stars with around 500 reviews. So, I guess people like it. But their bartenders are as unfriendly as I have ever encountered.  Maybe if you get a table it's different.",

    "text": "I gave this restaurant 5 stars 3 years ago. Since then I have had several dinners and parties there and recommend them to multiple friends. But after the second horrible experience there I have to speak out. (Last year I was racially profiled. The waitress would not let us in and asked me if I was able to pay the restaurant minimum. Her attitude changed immediately after my Chinese husband showed up.) I let the first incident slide but this one sent me through the roof. I just helped my friend's family plan a 40th birthday party for her and the night manager was one of the rudest people I've ever met. Let me preface that my husband and his family know him from many years of working in Chinatown and we've always helped support his business. To make a long story short: I booked a birthday party for 7:00. The family came early to set up, as he said it was allowed. At 6:30 he came in yelling that we have to leave at 9:00 because he has someone coming in and we can't stay there all night. I reminded him that we have a 7:00 reservation and that we spoke several times to confirm and he said \"So what I don't care, it doesn't matter be out by 9.\" He was yelling at me across the restaurant. He was so unprofessional and hurtful, especially since we've always supported this business. At 8:55 he came in and said we could stay longer, but I couldn't even look at him and everyone was ready to leave anyway. His verbal abuse practically ruined my night. I love the food and the karaoke room, but tonight was my last visit there. I STRONGLY recommend another restaurant. There are so many other restaurants that will give you the Chinatown experience and not treat you and your guests like crap. So, so, disappointed!",

We were very upset when we sat outside and the windows were closed during our dining experience, we asked for the windows to be re opened and he refused. He also refused us other seating to where the Windows were open for our dining experience. After walking ourselves through the patio to the dinning room we found multiple tables that would of accommodated our party.

Found the comfortable seats with no problem and ordered right away before the movie began.  I ordered pretzel sticks - food was hot, prompt & delicious.  I was excited for the movie to begin.  Once the advertisements were done and the movie started, that's when I noticed something wasn't right.  The entire screen was so dark that I was not able to make out the faces of the actors on the screen.  I kept lifting up the 3D glasses to see if it made a difference - nope.  The two people seated next to me were noticing the same and complaining.  I thought that maybe this is how the movie was filmed?  Then it got worse.  Even with the 3D glasses on, the shadows in the background on the screen were double and there was no discerning most actors' faces at all.  I got up and went to the lobby and asked for the manager.  The gentleman wore a blue shirt, middle age with a beard, said that this was the 3D experience, it was a \"closed-system\" and there was nothing he could do.  I simply asked him to come with me into the theater to see with his own eyes how dark it was.  He would not and did not.  I suspect this wasn't the first time he's heard this from a customer.  I've seen normal movies at this location before, but this was my first, and last experience with their 3D in room #1.",

    "text": "I am an ex-server for olive garden. It is one of my favorite restaurants and I drove over half an hour to eat there with two of my friends on Thursday may 31st. Our servers were Tracey and mikayla, whose was training, and I was extremely disappointed in the service that we recieved.\nI'd like to highlight first the some service that met the outstanding expectations that I know olive garden expects.\nWhen we arrived we were seated right away and our server in training introduced herself fairly quickly. We were given adequate time to look at the menu and make our selections. Our first round of salad and bread sticks, along with our appetizer very quickly. After this though the whole atmosphere and attitude seemed to change.\nOur tray of breadsticks and salad stood empty for almost 20 minutes after that initial  round. One of the reasons I love olive garden is because of the refills on salad, soup, and breadsticks. While we waited on someone to recognize that we needed refills, a tray of dirty dishes sat out in the dining room for approximately 30 minutes across from our table. Our main courses came out before our second round of salad and breadsticks and when I recieved my entree the sauce in the ravioli de portabellas that I had ordered congealed and the entree was cold. I flagged down a server as no one had asked us how are meal was. Although my meal was replaced with no question, it came out after both of my friends were finished eating and had recieved to-go boxes, so I was eating my meal alone. After we were all done eating, everything was boxed up, and dishes were cleared we then waited over another 15 minutes for my dessert to-go and our check. Finally when we did receive our check it was the wrong one. Thankfully I was planning on paying with a credit card so I didn't just leave money on the table and walk out. \nAgain I am very disappointed in the service I recieved tonight. The problem with our service is that there was no direction from the server that was training the new employee. Tracey seemed to be more worried about a large party that was sitting behind us but made a point to mention in passing that mikayla better do good tonight because she was making her money. Now I understand the basis behind why trainees give their tips to their trainer, as I went through the training myself, but tracy was not guiding her, checking on the table or shadowing her anyway. I feel like mikayla was sent out to the wolves with no food.",

We had to sit on the patio because it was so busy, there was a festival going on, but it was cool, the fans were on and it's covered so we didn't mind.  Our waiter was very good and food was good.  Service a little slow.  However, toward the end of the meal, a lady right outside the patio decided to stop, stand there, and smoke a cigarette for a good 10 minutes, blowing her smoke all over my entire family, including my 10 year old son (it was his birthday), my older son, who has an autoimmune condition, myself, who has severe allergies and asthma, and other patrons including another young child.  When I asked the waiter if she could be made to leave (Florida Clean Air Act), his reply was, \"No, the ashtray is there.\"  So either Hellas provides a SMOKING AREA right next to their DINING AREA (disgusting and unhealthy) or the City of Tarpon Springs does and they do nothing to have it moved.

I have eaten multiple times at the Daily Bread and have yet to have an enjoyable experience.  The food is so-so at best.  Their sandwiches are basic and lack any real flavor.  I also tried the BBQ Chicken pizza and it was okay.  \n\nI certainly wouldn't steer anyone away from this place based on the food.  The food is basic and simple, not bad but also nothing great.\n\nMy biggest qualm with the Daily Bread is the service.  The majority of the workers seem utterly uninterested in helping out.  There was a line of about 6 people and one person at the register.  There was no sense of urgency to help any of the customers in line.  We waited for a good 5-6 minutes to put an order in.  After receiving our cups to get our drinks we looked for a clean place to sit and eventually settled on a table top that was the least dirty of the tables available.  There were plenty of open spots but it just appeared as though there was lots of trash left behind.  Does anyone bus these tables?\n\nI anticipate that people are responsible for cleaning up after themselves, but it appeared as though the tables hadn't been effectively cleaned in a while.  There was also some trash on the floor that hadn't been addressed as well.\n\nThe order number was called and the order was only halfway completed.  When we asked which sandwich was ours, we were basically ignored as the girl put up two more orders.   After another few minutes the rest of the order came up and we began to eat.  I tried both items and as I stated before, both were okay.  The problem is that the food was just unable to make up for the lack of organization, the slow speed at which we were served, or the cleanliness of the restaurant.\n\nAfter 3 attempts, I'm writing the Daily Bread off and won't return.  I'd rather go to St. Louis Bread Co, get the same level of food, but in a clean environment and a timely setting.",

The sandwich came with cheese which I had asked to exclude but had to take it as I was rushing for a flight. The bacon was nearly raw like it just came out of the package. It ruined the entire sandwich and in the trash it went.",

I literally saw the guy mixing a potato salad with his bare hands and then wipe his nose to return to mixing. \n\nYears later, at their new location, I decided to give them another chance. I will concede they said they have a new cook this morning, but my oh my, the food was so bland and undercooked and just overall gross. It's bad enough that the environment is reminiscent of a garage sale turned restaurant - where the items were kept in their original condition by failing to clean them. But on top of that, it's just overall dirty. \n\nNow, the icing on this dirty cake, is that the servers (if you can call them that) are not kind. They are unaware of the menu, they act like it's a burden to help. They need training. One guy was way more concerned with air drumming than attending to my drink order. \n\nIt's a bunch of young people, poorly trained, making gross food, in a dirty environment, where they're too cheap to provide real silverware or even a salt shaker. And WAY OVERPRICED. I got to pay $50 for my crap experience. \n\nSeriously, let this place be overtaken by the mold that's likely growing in the corner of the room. \n\nThank you. \n\nI will never return to this place again.",

I was eating in the home office and bit into quite a few cold chicken pieces. I ate around the chicken as I have an unnatural fear of food poisoning. We live very close to the restaurant, so either the container the chopped chicken in was cold, or the meat was not cooked all the way. I went to go check on my husband in the living room and he stopped eating all together. Half way through his burrito, he found a 4 or so inch long brown hair. Yay for finding hair in your food! I asked him if he wanted me to call the restaurant and he said no. He just tossed his food, as did I. \n\nFour hours later and my stomach is still not agreeing with me.

Penca is a small restaurant and I knew we would not be able to walk in and get a table, hence the reservation.\nWe showed up and we were told it would be a while, a group was seated at our table.  We waited, and waited.  I had some disagreeable word with the hostess.  We waited some more.  We got two stories - one was none at all just \"sorry\", the other was the group came in claimed the table and told the staff they were friends of the owner and they'd cause trouble if removed from the table.  Doesn't matter to me because if the latter is true the owner needs new friends since the current ones will put them out of business, and if the former is just ineptness on the part of staff they'll be out of business.  \nAnd so we waited some more.  Given the timing leaving for anything but Subway was not an option. We got seated about 35 minutes late.\nThey comp'd us two drinks for eight people for the wait.\nI will give a shout out to our server who did a great job of trying to put this train wreck back on the tracks.

As another reviewer mentioned, they don't even out the dough so there was substantial more at the top of the pizza while the bottom was falling apart with the ingredients. The pizza was not hot, even after warming it for 20 seconds, very soggy, and the toppings were horrible (looks like they don't use real sausage). Pizza was very inconsistent, such as not being uniformly warm, sloppy, thin sauce, and cheese that easily slide off the pizza. Some of the guys look like they are in drugs, which is not surprising due to the poor quality of their pizza. This was one of the worst pizzas I have ever eaten! Folks that think this pizza is good need to have their head examined! I doubt those folks travel much outside the country let alone the local area. Delco standards are so low....:(",

We were turned away at the door with a \"no dogs\" rule because of my fully registered, trained and vested service dog. I asked the hostess if she realized it was illegal to deny a service animal. She said they had recently had an issue and installed the rule of \"absolutely no dogs.\" Can't enjoy a place that won't allow me to responsibly take care of myself.",

    "text": "I used to come here quite often, my father did the interior construction before they opened and Michael always cooked us a great meal. That was years ago. Since I've moved back to Tampa, thought I would stop in for lunch with friends. Michaels Grill has changed and it is HORRIBLE! The lunch menu is just sandwiches and salads, blah! The Service was awful! There were 3 empty tables outside and it was beautiful outside, but we couldn't sit there, they were reserved. So we had to wait for a table, even though there was a table open that seated 6, we were a group of four. They wouldn't let us sit there. While we were waiting for the table to be cleaned, a group of 3 came in and the hostess sat them at the table for 6!!! WTF!!! We finally sat down and ordered right away. We waited a very long time to get our food, the group of 3 at the 6 table got their food quickly, and so did a couple of tables who ordered after us! When the food finally came, they gave me the wrong quiche. I ordered the special, florentine. The waitress didn't notice that it was not what I ordered and went to fix it, but then she said they were out of the special. I looked over at a few of the tables that got their food before us, and ordered after us, they had 3 slices of Florentine quiche. Again WTF!!!! So then I asked why they were able to get what they ordered, when we ordered before them... She just said that our table had a sandwich that took longer than theirs! Really! So I just kept the shecrab soup. Which use to be amazing, but now it has a gravy consistency! Yuck! We were all very disappointed with the service! And the food is not up to par like it used to be. My friends thought the sandwich and salad were not high quality and definitely not worth the $$$. Sorry Michael, but you should just close lunch service or fix it!",

He seemed unfazed. The food came out and we had all lost our appetites. When the check came they had taken 10% off the bill. The manager stated that they need to get a new exterminator. Ya think?

Unfortunately, I forgot that this is the Penn Relay weekend (huge mistake). After driving 1.5 hour and taking 30 minutes to find a $15 parking space, I finally arrived. The place was not too packed but half the patrons were gathered around the ordering counter. It took me a few minutes to realize that this increadibly roudy, vulgar bunch had aready placed their orders but were just hanging out at the counter, thus preventing newly arrived customers from placing their orders. I tried my best to get noticed and to get to the counter but had no luck. Ultimately, I and a few other customers (or should I say \"potential customers\" eventually gave up and left. The cincher for me was that the staff were clearly aware of what was occurring but made no attempt to control the crowd. I may have waited if the staff showed some business savvy and kept the counter area clear but unfortunately, they appeared overwhelmed and confused. i've eaten at the Jerk Hut several times (food is OK-good) but this visit left a bad taste in my mouth so I may have to reconsider future trips across the bridge for authentic JA CUISINE!!\nPS: Memo from prior visits, their wait staff can be a bit rude.",

    "text": "I believe this place offered authentic Mexican food.  With that said, there were a few red flags.  First of all, we had trouble ordering.  I do not speak a bit of Spanish, and our waitress, and all staff in proximity did not speak English.  This was awkward.  There was also an issue with a smartphone-based coupon, which was kind of the entire point of going there in the first place.  After a young girl who worked in the adjoining grocery store came over, she advised me that it was her manager's policy that all discount codes had to be physically printed out.  She laughed at me when I told her that it wasn't my problem that they have weird rules for discounts.  She quickly believed that she had stalemated me with 'It's not my problem, either.', and I was laughed at.  When I informed her that it wasn't funny, I was told that the discount would be applied.  \n\nHere comes the food.  It was good; it tasted good, it was priced-well, and the order was accurate.  I noticed 2 things - about 5 feet away from me, a waitress was very clearly picking her nose.  Also, she had a finger in her mouth for no less than 45 seconds.\n\nThe ambiance seemed like a practical joke.  Authentic music was supplied via tinny PA speakers that had a source supplied from a laptop playing Youtube videos.  The televisions were strangely lined with a thick layer of Saran wrap.\n\nAll-in-all, I'd avoid this place in the future.",

My fiancee and I had the Flying Pie on State Street once before, so we were really excited to try the one closer to our home. \n\nWe decided to try and call Flying Pie in Meridian. The number just rang and rang. We tried 4 times, to no avail. Finally we just decided to go in. It was hard to get there with the one way street when traveling southbound on Meridian Ave. BTW. We walk in to the restaurant, and we see two families sitting down eating. While waiting in a one person line I decided to call the phone number to see what would happen....NOBODY EVEN FLINCHED to answer the phone. We got to the front of line and told the gentleman working the counter that we had to tried to call several times with no answer. He shook this off like it's a normal thing to not answer the phone and that it seems ok to do so. We were going to order anyhow, but then we found out it was going to be 45 minutes to an hour for TAKEOUT. This infuriated me after not being able to reach them on the phone,  then drove over, to find that out. Plus, the counter seemed totally annoyed and didnt care one bit that we were hungry and upset...almost as if he wanted us to leave. We left and I'm writing this in the parking lot because I'm so mad I feel this is more important than actually getting food that I'm so hungry for. \n\nThis company has great tasting pizza, but the service here at the Meridian location is absolutely horrible. They may be laughing this off today, but when more and more people turn to social media to find out where to go, they'll have dug themselves a hole too deep to crawl out of. No second chance with this location for me. Maybe I'll go to the State Street location if I'm out that way sometime.",

So when I am home, I love coming to Collingswood for some delicious eats.  I had a positive experience the last time I was at Sabrina and was hoping to create more since I was asking my friends to be in my bridal party.\n\nThere are no reservations for brunch on Sabrina's on the weekend but they will accept at least a 30-45 min call aheads for a party.  My friend did a call ahead for ten am. My friends tend to struggle with being on time and there is a policy that everyone has to be there to be seated.  The policy makes sense and I was open to the hostess that we were at fault for not all being there.   My friends didn't all show up until 10:40.\n\nThere was no table available which was fine since we were late.  But I was not okay with the hostess rudeness towards us.  She told us that we never did the call ahead despite the verified text from the restaurant saying we called ahead on my friend's phone.  We let that comment go since we were taking ownership that we were not all there on time.  She told us that the wait would be about 30-45 minutes and they will text us when the table is open.  She told us to go walk around since there was a farmers market happening close by the restaurant.  She also reminded us that the whole party had to be here.  I don't mind the reminder but again her tone was rude towards us.  We let it go again because we were at fault for our struggle with timeliness. \n\nWe take a walk and about ten minutes later we get a text that the table is ready.  We get back quickly and wait in line since there was people checking in/getting seated in front of us.  When it is our turn, the hostess tells us we missed our five minute mark and the wait was going to be a 15-30 minute wait.  Again her tone was rude and this time we were not at fault.  Her time said we arrived there six minutes after the text.  Okay this means... we were on time but we waited patiently in line for people in front of us to check in/be seated.  Which means the hostess did not wait and sat people at our table. \n\nI initially was going to let it go but her rudeness was leaving not a good feeling.  My friend argues with her because it was not fair we were being blamed for something that was her fault this time.  Also she told us to go for a walk since the wait was going to be 30-45 minutes?!\n\nThe arguing was not worth it and I told my friends we were leaving.  We went to the tortilla press across the street.  It was a great decision, since the food was super delicious and the customer service was much more friendlier towards us.",

I tied ordering a taco salad and when I asked the girl for an add on of chicken, she said no. Not it will be an extra 2 or 3 dollars (which I would have happily paid) but just a no we won't do it.  I changed my order to the Udon Noodle Salad.  I was then told it would be 45 min-1 hour.  It was an hour and a half+ before I got my order. \n\nI was looking forward to a large arugula salad with chicken and the other items, instead I got a small bowl of cold noodles with a little arugula and cold chicken. It was awful and a waste of money.  I ordered sweet potato fries on the side and they would have been decent had they not been freezing cold.\n\nDon't waste your money!",

Ordered a pitcher of beer and 10 minutes later told I cannot have one alone.  That's ok   I remember living in Ohio the Hooters up there never gave someone drinking solo a pitcher   was just policy    even seen same policy in some Tampa stores   AFTER THIS ALL DOWNHILL.   Waitress must have thought we were mad and sent a manager over    I explained it is no problem and I seen the policies before   he then corrected saying it is a state law in a firm tone.  Ok  I was educated   very cool    he then had to be a know it all and tell me that the Hooters ANYWHERE never had a policy about pitcher serving and he knew cause he worked with the company 10 years.   LISTEN  NOW YOU MADE AN ISSUE OF A NON ISSUE,   it was the way they were in Columbus ohio!!!!!   Experienced it many times  I Did not care for the vinegar based hot sauce, and  then mr \"know it all\" had to speak up again saying Florida will be switching soon from butter to vinegar so get used to it.  Have since found from 2 Florida IMPORTANT HOOTERS MANAGEMENT PEOPLE that 1  they will never change over and 2 Other one says they are really fighting it.  The outspokeness of this manager really ruined a visit and overshadowed our very nice and sweet waitress    she was one of twins   cannot remember name though.  Beautiful store just try not to engage manager  #WillRegret",

It almost tasted like the restaurant added fermented shrimp paste or something similar. That's also not an issue, in itself. However, it is now 8pm, and I have still not yet left my hotel room since getting back from Penang last night. I'm currently having the absolute worst food poisoning experience of my life.  According to my primary care physician, aka WebMD, it is likely that I have some form of aggressive salmonella food poisoning.\n\nThe other dishes looked good, and I'm sure the prawn mee is typically not vomit/diarrhea-inducing, but i hope this issue is addressed promptly.",

Yelpers talk about it like it will change your life.\n\nI don't understand, and I never will.\n\nI've eaten at Surrey's three times in the past year, and each time my order has been borderline inedibly disgusting. I have eaten there with multiple dining companions, and they have all, to a man, in each instance found their own meals to be borderline inedibly disgusting. I've started to ask people I know, \"Hey, have you ever eaten at Surrey's?\" They always reply, \"I hate that place. The food is awful.\"\n\nI will offer an example. The huevos rancheros deluxe. The actual huevos rancheros base is flavorless. My over easy eggs were, in my most generous interpretation, over medium. The conservative helping of goat cheese (allegedly a main ingredient in the deluxe) was extremely low quality, smelling and tasting of goat the way very low quality goat cheese is wont to do. The lox had (surprise!) apparently been marinated in some kind of lime mixture, plus had been heated, possibly sauteed. The whole thing was *covered* in capers. Take a moment to imagine these flavor combinations. And it cost $13. \n\nThe emperor has no clothes.",

So we asked for some salsa to dress it up a bit -- that took an hour and I'm not exaggerating! The salsa was a thick mushy mess. Could turn the bowl upside down and nothng would've come out. Our food took an hour and a half, too. By that time, we were full on chips -- which were the only good thing on the menu! Oh... My favorite part... I ordered a side of beans and rice to go with my carne asada tacos -- which were more like unseasoned beef tips -- and I got a bowl of hard WHITE rice with refried beans on top. WHITE rice???

My wife asked him if they had any non-alcoholic cocktails because she is pregnant, and he talked to her like she was an idiot, and acted very put off.  When she did not like the daiquiri because it was too sweet, he replied \"well, it's a daiquiri\". \n\nThen, trying still to be nice, even though he was raising his nose at my wife, I said \"Do you have anything like a martini for pregnant women?\" And he said, \"I mean, we have juice...\"\n\nI'm alright with the fact that Mr. B's hasn't jumped on the wave of hip restaurants that  understand that when you are pregnant, you'd still like to have unique cocktail option (who the hell is still serving daiquiris?), but the dude was just an ass about it.  It's not often I spend 250 dollars on a meal and get insulted.    \n\n He was generally short and put off by us the entire night (every 15 minutes when he would happen to come over to our table... we had reservations at 5:30, he didn't take our order until 6:45).  \n\nAnyway, I hear there is good brunch at Mr. B's, but I don't think we will be going back.

About 7 minutes later when she returns I make casual conversation asking if she's making chili and she says no she's getting ready for Taco Wednesday.  I then order my Gyro and then she tell's me that she can't do hot food today because the grill is already being used for the ground beef for the Tacos that they will be serving tomorrow.  Ok, it's lunch time why are you not focused on lunch? I ended up going to Blue's City Deli and waited in a line of 10 people and still managed to get my sandwich 5 minutes after entering their Deli.

The open window seating is great. \n\nThe food is ok, not great, but edible.\n\nThe service is where the place needs serious help. One example: I sat at a table (this is a seat yourself type of place), and the table wasn't yet cleaned. The bus boy (old man) was rude about the situation and yelled \"you need to get up and move so I can clean the water on the floor!\"  Umm, ok? Maybe you should have a better system for cleaning tables? Or realize that the whole city is a little dirty and a little water on the floor would have gone unnoticed? \n\nOverall, management is the problem.

The bread in the cinnamon rolls was dry (either cooked too long or stale), there was hardly any cinnamon filling and the toppings were horrible. Mine was supposed to be a standard cream cheese topping but it didn't taste like there was any cream cheese in it.  Maybe they gave me the wrong topping because it tastes like coconut. My sister got maple flavored which she did not like.  The 6 year old ate her cotton candy frosting but we did not like it.  To say the least, we scraped off all the toppings and still didn't eat all of the rolls. Perhaps this was a fluke but I seriously doubt we will come back to find out. Sorry.

I could've walked out on my check 3 times before she asked if we were ok (I probably should have).... DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!  what a joke!!",

They under stuff your burritos, forget items in your order, ask unbelievably stupid questions, do not clean up the mess they make after each burrito and then proceed to drag your food through it.  \n\nBy the time you make it to the check out, they top it off by incorrectly charging you for your order, and because of the idiocy at large, they ask you to just accept their mistakes and move along because they can't figure out how to fix it.  \n\nHorrible, this is all over several visits.",

    "text": "A few years back my wife and I went here for lunch.  It's clearly a bar first and foremost so it was mostly empty when we were there.  I guess some people start drinking early, but not that many this particular day.  We had never been before but were close by and craved burgers and chicken tenders so we gave it a shot.  Again it's primarily a bar so don't expect it to be a place for a relaxing quiet meal for two.  Nothing wrong with that, especially if you're there to watch a game.  I ordered a burger and my wife got chicken tenders.  We got our ketchup and all that situated and started eating.  My wife took a bite of her chicken and immediately received a burn in her mouth. The tender had a pocket of hot grease in it so when she took a bite, the grease spurted out onto the roof of her mouth.  It was so bad it burned off the skin and started bleeding.  She got some ice from her pop to help ease the pain, but that didn't do much.  I got our server's attention and told her that my wife burned her mouth.  She replied, \"Well, they just came out of the fryer\" and walked off.  We ended up leaving with to-go boxes.  The next day my wife went to the doctor as the burn was still bleeding and painful.  We were angry so we notified the corporate office.  A week or so later we got an apology letter and a $20 gift card.  The person who sent the letter said he spoke to the manager at that location and instructed him to have a meeting with his staff about this incident.  As my wife mentioned in her note to the company, it's common practice for servers to tell patrons when their food has just come out of the oven or fryer and to be careful because it is very hot.  But the issue is really about the server's attitude.  We wouldn't have written corporate if the server had been concerned about my wife's burn.  We used our gift card to order something for carry out and brought it home.  We figured this would let it cool down.  But we've not been back since.  I believe the corporate manager was sincere in what he wrote and am glad he was having the store manager meet with his employees.  However, he should have offered to pay the bill for the doctor's visit.  Hopefully this hasn't happened to someone else.",

    "text": "The next morning we were up early, filled with expectations of the new adventures in New Orleans. We decided to walk to have breakfast in Surrey, which we found on Yelp. It was a highly recommended local breakfast place. Located far from the touristy French quarters, it's a small shack-dive beloved by locals and tourists as the best in local cuisine. Even before we got there, we saw a crowd of people waiting outside. The wait for a table was 30 minutes so we felt lucky and elated to sit at the bar. We got a watermelon and jicama salad and a crabmeat omelet. I was disappointment from the first bite. The omelet was soooo rich, like it was made with cream and butter and more butter-cream on top; it made me nauseous. The salad was so plain, it felt like a joke, a few pieces of watermelon on ripped up leaves of bibb lettuce  covered with black pepper. I needed to eat something and asked for a garden salad with a poached egg. It was a poor showing with some mixed greens, a pathetically thin slice of tomato, a few cubes of huge cucumbers used for juicing and a balsamic vinaigrette mixed by finger right in front of me. The place is a tiny shack, should be filled with lovingly prepared local cuisine. It is NOT. The food, as well as the service and the ambiance are a poor showing, more hype than substance. The supposedly organic fresh juices, at $7 a pop, are not squeezed to order but poured from containers from the fridge. Freshly squeezed should be freshly squeezed. They refused to give us water with ice. How can you not give people water when its so unbearable hot outside? We paid more for our breakfast than a top French restaurant in New York and I walked away hungry and disgusted.",

    "text": "I have never been so insulted and talked down to in my life. Michelle, I think that's her name it's on my receipt but she never introduced herself, was the rudest person I have ever given my money to in my life. When we sat down she was talking about personal issues with the barback loud enough for us to hear and I thought that was odd in and off itself. When she gave us our menus she said a few times \"these menus are good for the next 30 seconds.\"  Sorry but either give us brunch or give us dinner menus and explain that the kitchen is in the midst of a shift change, don't make us feel pressured because you dropped menus that have an extremely short time limit. Instead of eating we decided to just get drinks. She let us know that the brunch menu libations were, her words, 2 for 1. We ordered a mimosa off the list and hung out. When we got get drinks they set two wooden tokens down but didn't reference the at all, so we didn't know what they were for.  Eventually ordered some food off the dinner menu to go. She was very non existent the whole time we were sitting at the bar, not attentive at all. When we asked for the bill I saw that both our drinks were on there. I asked about them and let her know about the 2 for 1 statement she said. She then proceeded to tell me it was buy one, get one and that's what the tokens are for. I told her that \"buy one get one\" and \"2 for 1\" are different and if we knew it was BOGO we would have ordered another drink (if she would have even paid attention to us).  After a little back and forth she said she would take care of it and that \"they weren't trying to screw us.\"  She talked to us like we were the worst people on earth because she doesn't know how to explain her own restaurants policies. I work in an industry that has me visiting 10-15 bars/restaurants/hotels a day and I have never had a worse hospitality experience in my life. Tavern Management - this employee is losing you revenue left and right.  Not only is she not taking care of customers and grabbing reorders, she is turning people away for good. This treatment was so horrible and off putting that I am going to go out of my way to recommended against going to Tavern due to the disrespect we felt. Hopefully your floor managers recognize how bad she is and theyo do something about it because she is taking money out of your pocket every shift she works.",

Our server seemed really nice at first to our table of four, but as the night went on, we saw her paying more attention to the table of four behind us. She was attentive to them, and checking in on them regularly. At one point we were out of water. Someone else had stopped to bring us more water. We had to flag down our server to get another drink for my friend, but she left so quickly after that, that we were not able to order for the rest of the table. While we waited, we noticed the table on the other side of us got all of their food...they were seated about 20 minutes after us. Our server could not be found for awhile, so my friend got the attention of another worker to see if she could check in on our order...this was over an hour after we were seated. We were seated at 7:33, but did not get our food until 8:45. She did not ask if we needed anything else. Our server never checked in and asked us how our food was. She never apologized that it was busy and that our food took so long. She did ask the four guys behind us many times, and I even heard her say they were getting 16 oz beers for the price of a 9 oz. Wow...how did they get that deal? One of my friends was getting tired, so we decided to ask for the check shortly after we ate our burgers. Our server flew right past our table to the table behind us to ask if they needed anything, then she started to walk away. My friend yelled her name 3 times to get her to come back so we could ask for the check. Still no apologies, no asking how our food or experience was. Personally, I was ready to walk out. But my friends were kind and still left a tip and did not make a ruckus. I completely understand that you folks were slammed with the Halloween convention in town, but it's no excuse for poor customer service, especially to those that live downtown and frequent your restaurant and recommend it to others. It's going to take me a long time to go back, if I ever do. I certainly will not be recommending it anytime soon. Sad and disappointed on many levels.",

It seemed to be missing an ingredient that I couldn't put my finger on, but the broth was clearer than that of my go-to spot, Noodle City. The fresh spring rolls were solid.\n\nOn my second visit, my meal was inedible. I ordered the grilled chicken b\u00fan, and there's no way this meat was merely grilled. It was probably cooked before and microwaved at some point, and it had  weird texture. The chicken was in huge chunks, it badly needed seasoning, and the chunks were extremely dry and tough. The rest of the b\u00fan was a ton of vermicelli noodles (though not exactly the right kind), some shredded iceberg lettuce, a little bit of shredded cucumber, and some bland pickled carrot and radish (no punch to that pickle). Overall, the dish had no flavor, even after dumping the fish sauce over it, and the meat was downright disgusting.\n\nMy wife's pho ga was not as good as the pho tai she ordered the time before. The broth was cloudy and had a thick layer of grease on top that needed to be skimmed. The chicken was horribly dry after being boiled for who knows how long. It still seemed to be missing some ingredient that neither of us could identify.\n\nI'm not eating here again.",

    "text": "I thought this was a great addition to downtown St. Pete and was thrilled to have a local place with an extensive selection of spices being that I am a cook. However, the owners are gay hating bigots! This isn't a review on the shop or the product, but a review to let the LGBT community to stay away! I have shopped a few times and each time have been treated differently than the straight people shopping in the shop. The only reason I returned was to make sure my feeling was right. The male owner each time refuses to come from behind the counter to assist me. Its as if he fears he'll catch some disease by talking to a homosexual. Furthermore, I have been there with straight friends and each time have been ignored even though I am the one who need assistance in locating a certain spice. The one time his wife was around she intentionally (and randomly I might add) brought up a conversation about Chick-fil-a and MItt Romney. Again, this isn't a negative review on the shop and its contents but on the owners who cannot refrain from hiding their hatred towards a large part of the Tampa Bay community.  For those wanting to support an anti-hateful local business there are plenty on central and if you need gourmet spices visit The Fresh Market, Rollin' Oats or Earth Organics.",

We were seated quickly and our server gave us our drinks quickly, but it was a downturn after that. First the chips and salsa were tasteless, I have found better tasting salsa from jar salsa at the grocery store. Also we waited for ridiculous 45 minutes for our food to come out. All we ordered was tacos, a burrito, and one chicken enchilada. Simple freaking meals...I mean come on that should take 10 minutes. After the server gave us our food finally...he never came back to check if we needed anything else. We could not even flag anyone to refill our waters. The burrito and tacos were very bland but edible. The chicken enchilada was the worst enchilada I have ever had. I couldn't even eat it. The red sauce on it tasted like some old can enchilada sauce that has been sitting in their kitchen for awhile. After we were done eating we sat there for another 15 minutes before the server came to our table. I told him I didn't like the enchilada and he did take it off the check, but that doesn't make up for one of the worst service from a restaurant that I have experienced. We won't be back.

We started wondering if Ted Peter's is associated with that place Dicks Last Resort where the staff is intentionally miserable.  While there was one server who was friendly (taller blond with a braided ponytail), the rest of the staff were simply unhappy people.  The majority of the time we were there they moped around behind the counter like zombies where a TV was on with the news.  Smiles were met with grumpy faces, waves from a smiling 17 month old were met with a obvious turn the other way, questions were met with short and unpleasant answers - it was depressing to say the least.  To say it nicely, the staff all need some hugs- as someone previously mentioned about Carl (again except for the blond with braided ponytail, she was pleasant). If you are looking to bring out of town guests to Ted Peter's, I don't recommend it. If the experience was like ours tonight, your guests will certainly leave with the wrong impression of the people of St. Pete.",

I had ordered escargot as an appetizer and they had a metallic taste with undercooked garlic in the butter.

    "text": "Probably one of the WORST experiences I've had in a restaurant :( Let me just start off saying, the food is good! Nothing wrong with any of the food, the chefs are amazing and we all enjoyed our food. The problem was with the service....\n\nWe made a reservation for 9 at 7:15 and we ended up getting their around 6:45. We were told we needed to wait because there wasn't enough chefs, which is TOTALLY fine and understandable. Then the woman at the front seats a party of 2 and another party of 3. So I asked why they were able to sit down before our group (and by this time it was about 7-7:10) and she told me because they had a smaller group.... Okay well if we had a reservation wouldn't we be first to sit down? We didn't care if the chef wasn't ready we just wanted to sit down order drinks and have some appetizers. We were then seated and our server Ivan came over very promptly which was nice. After he got our first round of drinks this is where things went down hill. \n\nWe ordered some sushi, simple sushi. Salmon, and shrimp. We ordered 2 rolls, a crunch roll and a shrimp tempura roll. He brought out yellowtail, tuna and 2 veggie rolls. I kindly said that the food wasn't ours and that wasn't what we ordered. He told me that it was and that I was wrong. So I asked to see the sushi paper because maybe I marked the wrong thing. And then he said he threw the paper away but he took the sushi away with a HUGE attitude and said he would go try and find the paper. Well our group could see him in the back area and he pulled the paper out of his apron and came over and said oh yeah I guess it was my fault I brought you guys the wrong stuff.... Okay that's what we tried explaining! The stuff finally comes out and tasted perfect! So then some of us ordered the teppan and we got our miso soup and then once that was done we got our salad. None of us had forks and I'm pretty sure maybe 1 out the 9 of us knew how to use chopsticks so I asked for forks and he said yeah no problem. Well we waited out 10 minutes until we saw him again and couldn't find any other servers to ask for their help so we ended up just eating with our fingers. We finally see Ivan and asked for forks again and he said, \"do you honestly need them right now? Your food isn't being cooked!\" EXCUSE ME! I was so furious that he would even come back with such attitude. All of the girls needed forks and so we told him, yes we need them now. I almost got up to go find them myself! Anyways, chef comes, food turned out good and no Ivan to be found for about 30 minutes. So 2 girls in our group asked for boxes, myself included, and it took him about 15 minutes to get them so I ended up eating the last bit of food I was going to take home. So when he brought my box I said, \"I'm sorry, I don't need the box anymore I finished what I was going to take home, but thank you!\" (very politely) He then came back with \"ok well maybe if I take your plate away you'll stop changing your mind\" WHAT IN THE HELL!!!! At this point I was done trying to be nice. After2 and half hours I was so glad to be leaving! Ivan was so rude to ALL of the girls in our group! I hope if we go back, which we probably won't, that Ivan will not be there. I always try and give people the benefit of the doubt and maybe he was having a bad day, but if your day is that bad, don't come into work and be mean and rude to your customers. I work with the public and believe me, it's hard to always please everyone. But it's unacceptable to be rude to people!!",

I normally frequent the one on 40th and walnut (so often that they know my name and order) and the people have always went above and beyond at that location. However, today I went to the Rittenhouse location and after ignoring me for five minutes, the lady wound up taking my order. I ordered 3 items off the menu and I tried to use my gift card. At first it got declined and then a manager came over. She checked my balance and it said 0.00$!!! I was devastated. Since my fianc\u00e9 doesn't really lie to me (why would he in this situation?) I am left to believe that when he bought the gift card, the worker pocketed the cash and never loaded the gift card. I'm very upset because I love the food so much, but this is unacceptable. They have lost a loyal customer and I will also warn others about the dishonest workers at this location.",

    "text": "Absolutely terrible in every aspect.  My fianc\u00e9 and I came here on a Saturday at 5:45.  All of the waitstaff were standing around the back of the restaurant looking at us awkwardly.  Eventually the bartender greeted us from behind the bar and pointed to the table where we will be seated.  I ordered \"The Cactus\" margarita, and it was salt lime juice and water.  Not a drop of tequila in it.  I'll give it to them that the salsa was good because of the added chipotle.  However, they have the audacity to charge $4 for an extra basket of stale chips.  Our food came out reasonably quick. My fianc\u00e9 ordered the chicken fajitas and I ordered the 5-Alarm burrito.  Mine was dry as a bone, bland, and not spicey at all.  I'm reasonably sure that they got a frozen burrito from wava and heated it under a panini press.  My fianc\u00e9e chicken was also dry and just over all bland.  Then came the waiting. We asked our waitress for the check and then she disappeared for 20 minutes.  I asked her again as she passed by our table, and still had to wait another 10 minutes.\n\nIt's a different story if they were the only show in town, but this is Main Street manayunk.  There is no reason for places like this to be taking up space if this is the quality and service they are offering.",

Now the food is not that good.  Pizza has declined in quality over the last couple years.  Calamari is always soggy.  The pasta and sauces are just so-so.  \n\nNow for the reason I will NEVER return.  I placed a phone order.  I was told twenty minutes.  I went to pick it up and got there 25 minutes after my call.  I had to wait another 15 minutes.  The restaurant was not that busy.  The man who rung me up and barely spoke English hovered over me while I signed my slip, to the point that I was uncomfortable.  When he saw the tip line had a zero on it, he huffed very loudly and gave me a dirty look like he wanted to fight or something.  If I was classless like him, I might have been upset and lost sleep over it.  But knowing I will never, ever return to this horrible place actually just made it quite funny.  And when I got my food home, it was again just bland and boring.  \n\nI do not recommend this place at all anymore.  A year ago, I might have.  Two years ago I always did.

The pizza (which we waited 30 minutes for, though we were the only customers in the place) was thin and limp crusted, with rather sparse and unflavorful toppings. The Greek (Grecian) pizza was particularly \"blah\" tasting, and for some might even be considered disgusting. Very strange. Their somewhat Hawaiian-like pizza was okay, but just not anything special, especially for the money. Eclipse's pizza crust is supposed to be something particularly special, but Black Rock Pizza's is far superior by comparison. After this dining experience, my wife and I wished we had just spent $10 for 2 large 1 topping Little Ceasar's pizzas. It would have been twice as good and filling at a third the price. Don't bother with this place. It is more hype than substance. Not worth it at all.",

Anyway we decided to order seafood delight with brown rice, vegetable lo mien and a half peking duck with sticky buns.  First of all seafood delight was served on a sizzling skillet which cooled down quickly. Also, it was served with a small portion of brown rice. Maybe its my fault I should have known it was an individual portion and not served family style.  The lo mien was Ok but again it was a small portion.  All of this would have been OK but the peking duck was the worst. I was really looking forward to the sticky buns and to my surprise when the duck came out it was served with cold flour tortillas! When we finished my Mom was still hungry and wanted to order more food (we are not really big eaters).  One saying grace were the fortune cookies that we enjoyed with our hot tea.  When we left the only people eating in the restaurant was the family that owns the restaurant.

Decided to do Tampa Pizza Company since we hadn't gotten it in a while. Unfortunately chose to use the EatStreet Yelp online ordering option.  Huge mistake. Order placed, got confirmation and credit card was charged. Went over to pick up food 20\nMinutes later as requested and they said they didn't get the order. They stated they don't accept Yelp/EatStreet orders online anymore. Never bothered to call us and say they actually canceled the Yelp order on us. They told us we should just re-order and pay again in the restaurant and wait another 20 minutes for it to be prepared and get a refund from EatStreet! Won't be going back with this poor customer service. Manager was even there and not helpful at all. No wonder why it was totally dead inside the place even while the Sunday market was going on right outside.",

The option to sit outside, sounded amazing however, we were left neglected. Waiting for along time for drinks, (approx. a 1/2 hour) food and service. For the price, atmosphere and service was not worth the effort to plan a Sunday here. Let alone, when leaving the restaurant was bare inside. Not sure, with the excuse they were short staffed by the server, where everyone was during our dining experience, not even apologetic nor a manger to come to check on the experience.

    "text": "I have visited Mucho Burrito over the years here in the Edmonton Area, but this location by far is troubled.  In my humble opinion the more negative or cautious reviews of this particular location are accurate and are consistent with my own experience of the place.\n\nFor my own experience, the presentation and cleanliness of the restaurant is fine.  You are greeted with a modern looking fast food restaurant with some nice branding about clean eating.  But once you speak with staff the experience unravels.  \n\nI found staff to be more involved in whatever they are up to rather than customer service.  This can involve on going conversations amongst each other, or something else that is not readily apparent.  In any event, some staff are completely distracted or disengaged.\n\nMy order took a while to come out, and it required corrections which added more time while customers continued to line up.  Within 30 minutes after enjoying the meal, I became violently ill, and the rest of my evening was basically spent nursing myself back to normal.  \n\nI made a complaint many moons ago about this to Mucho Burrito's website, but be forewarned I did not get any follow up whatsoever from them.  This is a demoralized business to the core.  \n\nIf you are craving Chipotle or some other Mexican branded place, do not come here.  You will be better off for it.\n\nIn fairness though, the Downtown location has been more consistent and I cannot speak for the other locations yet.",

Now don't get me wrong I have  been to chickie and petes on several occasions and it was a great experience BUT last night made me feel like I was on a bad episode of BAR RESCUE.\n\n1.  when we walked in (party of 3) the women at the hostess booth were so busy in their own conversation to even acknowledge that someone walked in. we waited for about 1 minute before even being acknowledge (STRIKE ONE)\n\n2.  after being seated the waitress came right over and asked us what were we drinking.  didn't give us a minute to even look at the menu.  after ordering the drinks (which came out very fast) we order our appetizers.  the appetizers came out very fast which was great.  but we finished the appetizers and waited a good 10 minutes before the waitress came over and took our ENTREE order (STRIKE TWO)\n\n3.  Entrees come out  (which were pretty good) and we finished them.  the waitress never not once came over and asked us how are we, did we need anything, she basically never came to check on us.  when she finally came over we asked for boxes  because we couldn't eat the rest of the food.  she brought us the boxes and left.  for another 15 minutes before we flagged her down and asked her for the check.  (which she should of brought when she gave us the boxes).  (STRIKE THREE)\n\n**oh did I mention that it wasn't crowded?  so there was no need for the POOR customer service.\n\n\nbottom line -- the FOOD here is GREAT,  but the customer service SUCKS ASS BIG TIME.  The waitress we had was very lazy, unprofessional, and act like she was intimidated by us.  My company does a lot of business with sports bars in Philadelphia and because of last night I will have them reconsider their relationship with CHICKIE and PETES.\n\nI will take GREAT customer service with mediocre food ANY DAY -- over POOR customer service and GREAT food..",

We began to seat ourselves and was told we could sit anywhere. They came and took our drink order pretty quickly and we received them within a few minutes, the girl who delivered our drinks said they would be back to take our order.  I'd say it was almost 10 minutes before they finally came and took out order. I started to wonder who our waitress was because 2 different females took the drink order and delivered them. Finally, one of the females came and took our order, so we must have been there for 15 minutes at least before our food order was taken. 10 minutes had gone by and a lady got sat in the booth next to us. Another 10 minutes later, she got her food before we did. So she got there after us, ordered after us, but received hers before us. Our waitress refilled my husband's coffee twice the whole time and she asked if I wanted a refill on my soda, I shook my head no and she could tell we were wondering where our food was, she says your food is almost ready, the kitchen is overwhelmed right now. But there was only maybe one new customer that came in since we had been there. I told my husband if we didn't get our food in the next 5 minutes, we would just leave.  So, 40 minutes and no food, we walked to the register and asked if we could pay for our beverages and our waitress said our food was almost ready. I said that we didn't want to wait anymore and she said we didn't have to pay for our drinks and we left. No apology, nothing. Im thinking either our waitress forgot to enter our order, or, the 3 cooks in the kitchen just wasn't concerned about how fast the food was being cooked. They did not look flustered, so I honestly don't know what the issue was. Won't be returning. Waste of our time.",

    "text": "Came in late on a Friday night past typical dinner hours to grab food with a friend. I ordered a chicken sandwich and my friend ordered the popular village burger. With my initial bite into my chicken sandwich, I knew something was wrong. The inside seemed tough and very hard to even cut with a knife, and I had my friend try it to confirm. My best guess would be they used frozen chicken but did not fully thaw it prior to cooking, therefore having a very hard middle! I quickly notified the server who sincerely apologized and I chose to go with a burger medium well. With the first bite into my burger, you could see a pool of blood oozing from it. Although I normally may order burgers medium rare or medium, I asked for medium well. The surprising thing was my friend ordered medium and his plate had not a trace of blood. \n\nDespite the establishment replacing my order quickly, which should be the standard protocol of any order that was messed up, I am highly annoyed/dissatisfied that I was not offered anything (free drink, the messed up order to be comped). \n\nI have been here several times and ALWAYS receive great food/service.

    "text": "First let me start by saying I love The Waffle House.  I eat at different locations all around the country.  In fact this location is two miles from my home and I didn't know it was there!  As soon as I found it I made plans to go there the following Saturday for breakfast. Saturday came and I showed up there at about 8:00AM.  It wasn't packed with people waiting to be seated so I sat down in a booth and ordered an ice tea while I looked at the menu.  And then I waited, and waited, and waited some more.  I didn't even get a smile out of my waitress, some young girl who couldn't be over 20 years old.  She was all smiles and friendly to everyone else but I was simply and obviously ignored.  Have no idea why, I was friendly and certainly not \"that\" customer.  Over the course of 30 minutes I watched her smile and greet everyone that sat at the surrounding booths, but not me.  Finally I said to hell with it and put three dollars on the table and left.  I went down Shadeland avenue to a carniceria/restaurant that always has fast and friendly service.  I'll update my review in another month and see how things go.  This time I'll sit at the counter.",

Sat there for 10min and not one person greeted us. Went to the bar to see about service and she informed that the kitchen was behind on completing orders. \nI had to apologize to my friends that we may not get any food after driving three hours down to enjoy the weekend. We did end up leaving the restaurant after 25 min wait for no service or an apology. \n\nI have to say this not what I expected from a big known place for adults to have fun along with kids also. Please do something about this. I hope this is not a reflection of how others could become.",

    "text": "Quite disappointed - not in the chain, but certainly in this location. This is the third time in a row we've had problems with our meal. The last caused us not to come back for over a year - and we should have stayed away.\n\nOn this Sunday evening, the restaurant was busy, but not jammed. There were five in our party, and we continually had to remind our server about things we were missing before our meals even arrived - butter, silverware sets, refills on beverages... \n\nI ordered a 13oz ribeye, rare, with only squash from the mixed vegetables. When it arrived 20 minutes later, the uneven piece of meat was medium rare on the thick end, and medium to well the rest of the cut - and I had a full serving of mixed vegetables with only one piece of squash. The manager took it to recook the order - and brought back a piece of meat so rare it was cold in the center and tough. I was hungry, so I chomped my way through.\n\nAnother steak was over-cooked, a third plate was missing sour cream and butter for a potato, cold shrimp on a fourth, and almost raw (crunchy) vegetables on the fifth.\n\nThe manager (Cody) apologized when he took my plate, but never checked back to see if my issue was resolved and for us to tell him about the other problems at the table. When the check arrived - full price. No offer of a dessert for the issues, nothing off the bill.\n\nWe will not be back. Jesse's is just a bit up the road, and the quality of both the food and the service are head and shoulders above this Outback.\n\nOne shout-out - Kate was great in helping to resolve issues, but she was tied up training someone else and we didn't see her again.",

Waited about 10 minutes for his arrival.  Totally arrogant and cocky, a real jerk. Could care a less about anything we said.  Talked down to us, like we were beneath him.

    "text": "Ruined our Friday happiness. \n\nThought it would be nice to go to Friendly's for a family meal to start the weekend...but the moment we arrived, I knew we should have left. \n\nTwo employees at the front were talking to themselves, ignoring to greet us. When a 3rd employee asked his colleague where to seat us, she clearly wasn't eager to have us in her section, then she caught my eye as she then knew I heard her. \n\nWe were guided to our table -- right next to the kitchen entry...meanwhile 1/2 the place was empty, as we passed by booths with \"broken\" signs on them and other dirty, uncleared tables. I asked to be seated at another booth--so we then were seated 1 row over from the kitchen entry... \n\nThe initial \"Hi, I'm so-and-so\" was fine and we ordered our 3 meals and waited. Drinks arrived -- my glass of Coke was chipped and the other glass of Sprite tasted terrible, like seltzer. Asked for another Sprite and got the same terrible drink. \n\nLater, I spotted our 3 meals on the warmer (remember, we are sitting 1 row away from the kitchen...) and ironically the warmer shelf is next to a clock. 6:02pm. Waited and waited...server finally walked by and I had to let her know that our meals were ready -- \"Let me check,\" she says.  6:04pm. She goes missing...then she brings 2 of the 3 plates to our table and disappears again. I had to waved down another server and asked for my plate, still sitting on the warmer. 6:06pm. That server goes missing. Our original server finally brings my plate. Burger with the wrong cheese...over-cooked waffle fries. (Or maybe fries were over-cooked and dry from sitting under the warmer for 5 minutes as I stared at it.) Turkey BLT was subpar and the kids chicken fingers were over-cooked too. \n\nI'm surprised the server came by later and asked how our meals were (albeit robotic) but not surprised that when we said I got the wrong cheese, she said \"sorry\" without any suggestions or offers to make good on her mistake. \n\nWe were ready to pay and eager to leave...we waved down another server who said she couldn't take our payment as our assigned server had to do it. We said \"Can you let her know?\" and she said \"I can't, she's with another table\" and walked away. We were in disbelief that this experience just got worse. \n\nThe only good memorable moment was when I said under my breath \"This place is terrible,\" and my young son repeated me. \n\nAdvice: Hire people who are actually Friendly or shut it down. This is an embarrassment. Will never go there again and probably never go to another Friendly's ever.",

The two sides were beans and greens. Out of the three meats the sausage was the least worse. All were dry and the sides did not have favors I would expect. I did not like anything. You even had to pay for bread.  I tried covering them up with the bbq sauces however even those were strange tasting. The sweet was pure molasses. The house was the only one I could tolerate.  I think they need to hire a cook that has tastebuds. We tried the apple crumble pie for desert and we even threw that away as it had no sweetness at all and no texture.  The price was crazy.

As a beginner in cooking I can judge this place's food is horrible. A day after the food looked like it had been out for weeks. Good food can last for a day or two.When i went in there to eat the hostess was nice. first, we ordered a glass a wine. he poured the wine, missed the glass and some spilled on the table and he just ignored it. hello. idiot. waitressing 101. go back. well needless to say. not worth your money at all. ive been there during happy hour with girlfriends and its fine. not a 'high end' restaurant by any means even though they try to make it that way.",

    "text": "I love 312 deep dish pizza. So much so, that the restaurant was on the short list of places I wanted to go during my last week in Nashville. I called last night to see how long the wait was, and was told that there was no wait. So my friends and I drove all the way across town for dinner at 8 pm. As soon as we asked for a table, we were told that they were out of deep dish. What?! How does a restaurant run out of their signature menu item?! And how did the person who answered the phone fail to tell me that when I called to ask about the wait? I would have appreciated the warning and would probably have delayed my 312 dinner for one more day. \n\nWe love the deep dish pizza so much that we decided to stay and try the thin crust. It wasn't until after we ordered, though, that our waitress told us it would be an hour wait! We know that's the deal for the deep dish, but it was doubly disappointing to get to the restaurant, find out they don't have deep dish, and then have to wait an hour for the thin crust (which was okay, but would never have made it on my short list to hit before leaving town).\n\nAll in all, it was a disappointing night for what has been one of my favorite Nashville spots. Big bummer.\n\nTL; DR:  call before you go and ask whether the restaurant is still serving deep dish because apparently 312 sometimes runs out of the crust.",

And oh boy the food is way over priced for the poor quality.\n\nAnd the bar tender dare to have the face asking for 20% tip.\n\nTo the manager you should first fire the bar tender and then fire the chef, probably in the end fire yourself for hiring such horrible people!",

    "text": "This was hands down one of the worst dining experiences that I've ever had in Philadelphia.  Ultimately, Xochitl gets one star because I do not have a \"no star\" option.  My friend and I dined here last night for restaurant week and had really been looking forward to it.  Neither of us had been before, so we thought Philadelphia's Restaurant Week would be a great place to give it a shot.  WRONG.\n\nWe arrived on time for our 7 pm reservation and were asked to wait in the bar area until our table was ready.  Not a problem.  And understandable on a Friday evening. Although the restaurant was not at capacity we didn't think twice about being asked to wait. About five minutes later, we were seated and our very nice server came to explain the menu and the customizable guacamole.  \n\nWe made our guacamole selection and placed the order for the remainder of our 3 courses.  As far as the food goes, the guacamole was the best thing we had.  I ordered sangria that was supposed to have peaches, but instead had grapes and apples.  I'm not saying that's impermissible, but it's totally different.  Lol.  Just saying.\nAnyway, from there, the courses went down hill.  The four cheese empanadas were a bit undercooked.  My main course, which the waitress described as their signature dish, was ok but did not make a real impression.  And the dessert....the churros.  I thought that was a safe choice.  WRONG.  They're probably normally excellent, but when I bit into it instead of the lovely, sugary sweetness that I was expecting, I tasted onion and garlic and lots of other savory spices.  Perhaps they had a shortage of oil in the kitchen.  Who knows?  \n\nBUT HERE'S THE REAL PROBLEM: Our waitress brought us the bill and we were winding down when the manager, Adam, came over to our table and said, \"ladies, I hope you've enjoyed yourselves and that you will come again.  If you'd like to continue enjoying yourself, I suggest you go to the bar, but we need the table.\"  Now is probably when I should point out that there were other vacant tables in the dining room and that the couple next to us was in the process of leaving, But I digress.  Apparently there was some special reason why he needed our table.  So we proceed to stare at him like he was crazy.  He took that as his cue to continue talking.  He said, \"we've been TRYING TO WORK AROUND YOU, but you've been here for THREE HOURS and we need the table.\"  We had not been there for three hours, it was slightly over two, and it was a four course meal. Moreover, we had to wait for our table.  Ultimately, however, if their primary concern is just turning tables and not providing a nice dining experience, then they shouldn't be in the restaurant business, nor should they participate in Restaurant Week.  \n\nWhen we started gathering our belongings, my friend asked the manager to move because he was blocking her chair.  After which he said, \"I don't allow people to talk to me like that.\"  This was unbelievable.   I have never been treated so poorly by a staff member at a restaurant...EVER.  I would not be able to recommend this establishment to my worst frenemy.",

Salad on one plate had more dressing then salad, really inedible. What I did notice was the complete lack of bacon or sausage or anything pork related. Odd for a brunch, but maybe gypsies don't eat meat?\nThe other thing I found was 1. It was 40 degrees in the bathroom, really really cold. 2. The wall next to our table really needed painting, or at least washing, food splatters and grease stains on the paint were really unappealing. The cute puffy wall coverings looked like someone used them as napkins over and over.  A tremendous disappointment after many really great experiences at Southern Cross. \nIt seems to me they can do a lot better, or close the place for a rehab. \nWe felt pretty ripped off with brunch, though the live music was awesome. Maybe dinner is better, breakfast is really hard to do well after all but I doubt we will ever find out as we have no intention of returning. In fact we cancelled our Valentine's Day reservation after this experience. Conshy girls up your game.",

    "text": "The only thing good about this place is the food. It's amazing. That is, when you can actually get it, which is unfortunate because this place could have incredible potential if the staff was competent. \n\nFlashback to a month or two ago. The weather was about to get bad, so the g/f and I decided to order some food to go before the storm came in. We placed an online order through their website. We arrived at the time the site said the food would be ready, only to be met with puzzled stares from the staff. They had received no online order. We showed the cashier the order confirmation and they informed us the online ordering system was having some issues. Ok, fine.\n\nFast forward to today, about an hour ago, the g/f and her friend wanted to meet up for brunch, so we decided on coming here. Their menu clearly states that brunch is \"All Day Sunday, 9am - 4 pm\". We get in line and begin to order brunch, when the cashier girl tells us they're, \"Not doing brunch today.\" I told her that was the whole reason we came. She replied that they were having some, \"Complications\" - whatever that means. Strike one.\n\nI order a sugar-free vanilla latte. My g/f, who was standing next to me, told me they didn't have any. Before I showed up, she ordered a sugar-free vanilla coffee and was told by the girl cashier that they didn't have any sugar-free vanilla syrup. When I asked if they did (I had ordered this on my first visit), the cashier girl asked and magically they had a full bottle of sugar-free vanilla syrup. Strike two.\n\nWe then place our food orders. I ordered a sandwich with a \"V\" in the name. It's not on their online menu, but it is on the menu in the store. It has turkey, bacon, cheese and avocado. I pay and then find my seat. Shortly after ordering, the same guy who took my order comes out to our table to tell us they don't have any avocado! STRIKE. THREE.\n\nIf you like to be forced into ordering something you didn't want because what you do want is not being offered that day, go here. \n\nI've been here twice and both times have been complete failures. Absolutely abysmal service. \n\nThe three of us decided we won't be coming back.",

The food is decent and there's a good beer selection, but I'm tired of being treated like shit by the too-cool staff. The straw that broke the camel's back was my most recent trip, when a group of us went here after work.\n\"Hey what are the specials?\"\n\"They're on the board over there.\" Points to wall.\n\"Ah, yeah I can't see those from here, can you just tell me?\"\n\"I mean you can just walk over there... ah, well I guess there is [x,y,z]\"\nSO there were three specials. Three. Not sixteen or a thousand, three. And my servers idea was that all five of us should go stand awkwardly in the middle of the restaurant to go figure out what they were. If this was a pizza place I would understand. But the food is $15+ a plate, so it's not crazy to think that your server, who presumably enjoys receiving tips, could tell you the specials.\nSo I went to the bar area hoping to see the manager. I was told that he was \"upstairs\" and that \"he doesn't like to be disturbed. But I guess you could tell me, like, what the issue is, and I could like, ah, tell him later.\" \n\"Are you the assistant manager or something?\"\n\"Nah, I'm one of the bartenders.\"\nYeah. Great. So shit service and a manager locked away in his high tower. Hopefully this place will go out of business and become something that doesn't suck so hard.",

I have worked customer service and usually ignore the small mistakes. We are all human.

The uniformly round sausage kibbles reminded me of those rectangular \"oh so tasty\" school cafeteria pizza.  I came here for the first time in 4 years because it was the last day of Youth Soccer.  The place was completely kid friendly, like Chuck e Cheese, Pizza Hut, and Little Caesar all roll into one.

The food was not to the quality of the prices that they charged on the menu.  The hostess sat us and the older manager was visibly not happy with where we were seated in the restaurant.  The french onion soup lacked flavor and could have used salt and pepper.  It lacked the beefy/wine flavoring that a good french onion soup should have in it.  The Beef Wellington, although beautifully presented was disappointing.  It lacked flavor and had no seasoning in it.  The Mushrooms/spinach/red pepper medley that it was paired with had CANNED red peppers in it. Seriously, a $25.00+plus dish with canned/jarred red peppers? It was like baby food.  The Flank steak had no seasoning to it and the sauce that it was served with it also lacked flavor and tasted like Mayo.  The chicken with shaved brussels sprouts salad was underwhelming.  The \"1/2 chicken\" was the size of a cornish hen. The server sold us on their \"amazing\" red velvet donuts for dessert.  That was a mistake. The donuts were hard and not warm, the \"white chocolate\" icing was hard as well and there was stale broken up donuts sprinkled around the plate with the chocolate.  The coffee was also luke warm.  We will not be back.\n\nHerbie's needs to revisit their seasoning in the kitchen STAT and rework their menu.",

She told me the guac was made last night and thats why it looked that way and that I can come back in for a refund... So many things about this expierence and this phone call were so wrong!

When dining we were seated promptly, as I had reservations. That is where it all went down hill. No one even acknowledged us for twenty minutes. We were not even brought a glass of water. When a waiter did finally arrive he offered no explanation for his tardiness. We ordered our drinks and meal all at that point, as it was lunch time and we didn't have all day to wait. Little did we know all day was what they had in mind. We\nwaited over one hour for two sandwiches. The waiter never apologized for never refilling our drinks or for the long wait times for food. An observant manager noticed our perplexed faces, and lack of food or drink, and asked if everything was alright. We informed him that all was not in fact alright and he brought us water and was very apologetic when we told him we are locals that come in all the time. If they were busy maybe I would give them a pass, but that was not the case. John Besh, if he's still involved, needs to get a handle on this place or it is going to be a memory.

    "text": "Wow!  I just wrote a scathing review about El Patron Pizza in Tampa for leaving unwanted and unwelcome fliers under the door of unsuspecting tourist here in Tampa.  I was going to use a lot of the same issues for this review of New York Pizza Grill, but now I'm not sure what to say, only to say it carefully.  I knew there was something not quite right about the greasy looking punk that was meandering in the hallway of the 4 star hotel where I am currently residing.  As soon as I saw the flier I grabbed my room key and went looking for this person.  In hindsight that was not smart, as soon as I got a look at the guy, I ran for the elevator.  Now, I am no shrinking violet, but this guy looked like he's slap his own mother.  After reading the other reviews on here, I guess I should be happy that this employee didn't turn around and attack!  My biggest issue with this business is that they litter the halls and rooms with these fliers.  They sneak into hotels, a place where you feel safe and after this, I don't.  It doesn't seem to matter where it is a 5 star hotel chain or a family run business.  I did call every one of the pizza place that do this, because I felt bad about complaining to the staff at the hotel, but after yesterdays run in with greasy guy for New York Pizza Grill, I had it.  I do not feel safe and I told management that, and the did call the police.  So, for the employee of New York Pizza Grill, if you get caught stuffing fliers under doors where you are not invited and do not belong, you are more than likely going to be arrested.  So when you are out and about making not enough to keep your car running, ask yourself if your boss will bail you out of jail.  I doubt it, they'll probably just get another less than intelligent person to litter, trespass, annoy and sometimes terrify, hotel staff and their guests.  There are numerous reasons not to eat at New York Pizza Grill, but I'm just tossing out a good reason not to work for them.",

    "text": "This is actually an 'Advance' Auto Parts now, at this same address: \n\nTerrible service. Came in with a battery (Advance brand) that needed to be replaced. Store was not at all busy. Two employees were making small talk with a female customer and a third was attending to a battery replacement for another customer. I waited with my wife for about 10 minutes and no one even acknowledged I was there. I finally asked the two employees who were making small talk with the customer if one of them might be able to help me and neither of the employees even turned my way, but instead made derisive comments under their breath to the female customer, who then explained how she was a 'customer' and she was being helped (despite having no items to purchase or having any kind of conversation regarding anything automotive with staff). I suspect she was an off the clock employee since she was the only one who would even address me. I located another Advance store on my phone, gathered my battery and began to leave. One of the employees finally deigned to offer to help me, but I wouldn't have taken a battery from that store if they were giving them away for free at that point. I went to the AAP on US19 and Central, where I received decent customer service and would return again. I will never set foot in the Gulfport AAP ever again, and I don't recommend any else do so either, unless you enjoy being ignored while employees conduct personal conversations with friends/off duty employees.",

    "text": "After a 90-min wait (we were told it would be an hour), I went for dinner with my sisters. The food was just okay and over-priced. The polenta wasn't the best I've had, the cheese empanadas were not empanadas but rather fried little puff balls (and if they're going to be vegetarian, there should more more, not less of the meat ones), the cauliflower was pretty good but again, not worth the price. \n\nBut let me tell you about our service! First the server brought out the wrong wine for my sisters (they got a red cab Mendoza, a white Chardonnay was delivered). Nobody really checked on us except to ask if we wanted to order more food. Then! One of my sisters PULLED A REALLY LONG HAIR OUT OF HER MOUTH AFTER TAKING A BITE OF FOOD!!!!!!!! When we alerted our server, his response was, \"ew, I'll be sure to tell the chef.\"\n\nNEVER did we get an apology, nor was the item replaced nor taken off the check!!!!! And on top of that, he charged us for the red AND the white wine!!!!! The sister who had the hair is super polite and it was impressive that she even alerted him of the hair, so unfortunately she did not fight to have the item taken off, regardless of my urging her to do so. Alas, I decided to share this review. That hair was LONG AND NASTY! \n\nNo way will I return. What a shame.",

The lady bartender said it was happy hour and she would get me a menu. Ordered fried pickles and a beer from the menu. Went to pay my bill an hour later and the dude with the long beard behind the bar rung me up. My bill was for normal price (and overpriced). He said the order was put it at 3:59 it looked like. He was a total jerk about it with no forgiveness after I told him I was led to believe it was happy hour. Needless to say there was no tip!\n\nI went back, a few days later, shockingly. Ordered a cocktail. A simple old fashioned with brandy. I asked for soco and they didn't have it. So i asked for brandy. Cocktail was good. Get the bill later ... $12 cocktail. For real! It wasn't even an 8oz cocktail. More like a 4oz! And there was a $4 bogus charge on there which i was unaware about when ordering and that long bearded guy again behind the bar told me what it was for after the fact (something to do with adding a higher liquor quantity). I wouldn't have wanted that in the first place!! So again, no forgiveness and forced to pay that bill. Again, zero tip. \n\notherwise, you can get takeout beer here and the outdoor couches are ok. But customer service really blows!!! they're so slow and unforgiving and confusing ! I hope that long bearded guy is not a manager. Very pathetic",

First, I asked them what was the meal of the day. A waitress told me that they don't have any left. Ok that was understandable. Then I asked the same waitress if I can order meat pies (arayes). She said that this will take 40 minutes to make it ready. She pointed to a group of people sitting of about 25 persons and implied that they were busy making food for them. Afterwards, I asked her what about just a regular appetizer like hummus and baba gannoush. She again said that they need 40 minutes to prepare it! Also she pointed at the same group of people with her finger. \nAt that point I just left the restaurant. \nIt is horrendous that they needed 40 minutes to prepare hummus!!

Asked to speak to the manager, she came to speak to us as she was on a rush to get out the door.  Said she would address the behavior \"later\".  We were clearly getting nowhere talking to her, as she was focused on leaving (probably during work hours)...\n\nAt a previous visit, all the patrons who came in after us were served while we waited 45 minutes AFTER they received their food to finally be served. I am starting to think these people are bigot racists. \n\nNever. Going. To that dump.  Again.",

I got 6 tiny shrimp 2 oysters 2 hush puppy's and 1 stuffed shrimp. Very tiny \"platter \" for $30. Usually very full of food. Now the biggest problem was the service! 25 min to be greeted by waitress and 10 more min to actually get the drinks. Refills were given if you were lucky enough to flag somebody down. Very disappointed! She even had a trainer. Three times drinks empty over 10 min. I'm sure they won't be there long if service does not improve!",

Cost us 26 dollars each., was not worth 26cents. My son had a steak for $38. and said it was only of medium quality, okay in taste, but not nearly worth the price. His girlfriend had the chicken and enjoyed it and my mother had salmon and said it was good.My daughter had one of the specials and enjoyed it very much.\nI would not recommend The W C Inn for dinner.

Service was poor- our server thought it was cute to sit down at the table while taking orders and gave a real \"put-out\" vibe at the end of the evening when our table of 6 didn't clear out immediately after paying the bill. Strike #1. Everyone agreed that the food, while not inedible, was nothing to write home about. I had Salmon With Lump Crab. portion of salmon was overcooked and the crab was not lump (I'm from MD I know lump crab meat) the hollandaise was greasy and the rice tasted like seasoned Uncle Bens. Also, One,person in our group is on a very rigid diet and requested that the crispy wontons be omitted from her salad. The server was insistent that she include them, and despite SEVERAL polite refusals, the wontons were still sent out on the side! Folks, that was just weird and inconsiderate to our fellow diner.Strike #2.  I'm a beer drinker, and enjoy craft offerings from microbreweries. I tried the IPA (okay but not balanced-bitter and over hoppy) and a Lager (beer flavored water is what I thought on my first sip) Strike #3. So, overall I felt Granite City was lame. Wouldn't recommend it and definitely won't return willing.",

I ordered a $35 pepperloin with white pasta and my husband ordered bacon artichoke white pasta.  Well folks it was disgusting!!!  With a capital D. The white pasta tastes like pasta and if my husband didn't have bacon in his it would have had no taste what so ever. I got the 12 oz pepperloin medium with garlic butter. When I got this $35 steak it was well done no garlic butter and no peppercorns. So I cut into it two times thinking maybe I am missing the pink somewhere... nope well done and the edges were saw dust. Sent it back the waitress brings back the SAME steak smothered in butter.  R u kidding me!!  How do u make a $35 well done steak go back to medium with butter??  They r ignorant and the food is worse  save your money and go to Max's time out. The food is great and a third of the price. I will NEVER go back and I will be telling everyone I know how this place has slipped and is horrible. Thanks Tony's I saved me $35 dollars!!!",

It seems that every BJs that I go to though seems to be under staffed and you can't get your order in.( like 15 minutes after we were sat). I think that your team needs to have some urgency and make sure all the guest in the building are happy. This whole concept of sitting your servers 10 tables at once and thinking they are giving above and beyond service is ridiculous. So food is great love your specials just you need to have a manager out on the floor assisting with guest and team members.

    "text": "We ordered a cake for my daughters 6th birthday. She wanted a princess cake and picked one from the book they gave us for examples. After picking one out we were told we would have to provide the decorations, such as the tiara.  While I hadnt heard of this, I returned a few days later with a couple items, tiara and wand, to put with our cake. I watched the girl put out items with our order. When I returned to pick up the cake, nothing was on it...NOTHING!  At first, thry tried ACCUSING me that I hadn't brought anything in. Luckily, the girl that took our items was working and remembered I had brought items in and she had no idea what they had done with them. Once I started describing items, they admitted they had thought they were extra and put them on another cake (which doesn't make sense because I watched them staple the bag to our order).  I demanded to speak with the owner and she wouldn't come out because she was too busy(I could hear her telling her staff member that) After 15 minutes of demanding to talk to her, she came out with the MOST RUDE attitude and acted like,\"well, what do you want me to do about it. And said I could just run to the dollar store to get something else to replace it if I really NEEDED the cake that we ordered.\" After telling her that I was on my way to the party and didn't have time to replace the items her and her staff gave to someone else, she returned from the back with a brush and mirror. A BRUSH. After saying I wouldn't have a brush on a cake she just stood there and was like well do you want this cake or not because she had other stuff she had to do. They knew we were in a bind and I paid for the ugly cake. ..with just writing , just so I could get to the party on time. \nKim is by far the worse business owner I have ever dealt with. She is rude and acts like she doesn't need your business. I would never recommend this bakery to anyone and hope you choose another small business to give your money too.",

    "text": "This is the second time my husband and I have come to Josef's - expressly to get an assortment of cookies - so I can't speak on behalf of the meals they serve.\n\nJust before the holidays, we came in to get a dozen cookies. Since they were just for my husband and I, I thought even 12 cookies was extravagant. There was only one gal behind the cash register helping a short line of customers. The service was VERY slow. When our turn came, I mentioned that I wanted just an assortment of cookies. Immediately, the gal tried to HARD SELL me on the pre-made-up platters of cookies that were heaped on a large table in the entrance area. I kept saying \"NO, that's too many!\" But she just wouldn't listen, and kept telling me that this assortment was ready to go. \n\nWhen I *finally* got her to listen to me - the customer - I told her I wanted just one cookie from each line in the top two shelves of the display cabinet. Over and over and over and over I had to repeat this ridiculously simply request. Even my hubs was wondering if the gal understood English? She kept asking what we wanted, and then 15 min into putting some of the cookies into a box, I said, \"So what have we got here?\" And she said, I've got 5 cookies - what else did you want? Seriously, it was like some kind of skit on SNL. How difficult is it to grab ONE each of SIX different cookies on TWO shelves? We got the cookies and I have to admit: they were DELICIOUS! I think cookies (and probably cakes & pastries) baked at the holidays are bound to be good and fresh because of the turnover.\n\nFlash forward to yesterday. We returned with a sweet tooth to get just six cookies for us. One gal behind the counter was on the phone as we approached the cash register. She remained on the phone a couple of minutes (with no greeting whatsoever), then hung up and disappeared in back. Um. OK. Anyone HOME? After waiting 5 minutes, a different gal came out to take our order. This time, we got the cookies we asked for and went home to try them. HORRIBLE! \n\nWe took a bite from 4 of our 6 cookies purchased, and found they tasted like rock hard sawdust. I am not kidding. I bake cookies myself, and I know that when you bake them fresh - DAILY - they should be moist and tender. Yes, they look pretty all dolled up in frosting and daubs of jam, but the flavor is absolutely flat - not a hint of butter or sugar in them. I guess they use lard? I also suspect that the cookies stored under the hot lights of the display case are not only dried out beyond repair, but were probably baked a good week ago. I broke a Cary cookie in half and it just shattered like glass! The cookie was dry as a biscotti, and tasted like some kind of stale dog biscuit. \n\nThese cookies are an insult to Josef (if he is even alive and cares what is baked and sold in his store). We will not be returning to Josef's again for ANY dessert of any kind ever. I was so mad about these stale biscuit cookies I chucked them all in the garbage. Money down the drain. \n\nYou may as well get a small cookie or two at Whole Foods, or even a small box of infinitely fresher cookies at Trader Joe's! Josef's so-called Vienna Bakery is a total Fakery.",

I want to be fair, but gnawing at my gut is the overall poor food experience I had there. \n\nOf course I wanted something special for my mother on this day, so I gathered my siblings and their families and selected 3 places to attempt to get reservations. One was at the William Penn Inn, the other Route 6. I scoured the reviews and menus and decided Square 1682 was the best option. \n\nSquare was super accommodating  with my large party of 12 and the customer service was outstanding. I canceled the reservation with the two other places and banked on Square delivering a great day. That was a mistake. \n\nPositive: The manager, staff, hostess, waitresses were super sweet. \n\nThe mimosas were the best think i consumed that dining experience\n\nTwo  items were comped\n \nCon's:\nTwo of our orders were mixed up ( another waitress took the ticket), so 10 of us ate while two of us watched. The late food arrived about 15 mins later. \n\nThe prime rib sandwich was skimpy, grossly over cooked, and barely edible. I have had a LOT of prime rib in my life, this was thin and crunchy. It was served with a tiny bit of sauce on a firm fancy roll. My mother ordered the same and the disappointment on her face was awful. The others at the table had a variety of underwhelming dishes. No one was satisfied, but everyone was polite. I was crushed. \n\nThere were a total of 5 mothers in that bunch and there was absolutely nothing special about it.  It was a nice room, the staff was nice, but it was one of the WORST dining experiences I have had in Philly.\n\nI REALLY regret booking this place. We spent hundreds of dollars and everyone left a little quiet and disappointed. As a matter of fact my mother later confided she was STARVING after we left. \n\nI understand holiday restaurant service is maddening, but IMO this place was not properly staffed, nor prepared to handle providing good food on a special day. I would NEVER recommend someone come to this establishment. I wish I had chose one of the other places. \n\nNext year I'm #teamSomewhereElse! I don't mind paying the money, if I leave with a smile on my face. \n\nNo smiley face here....",

Nothing. Furthermore, the boss was stuck another 5-10 minutes behind a customer demanding a refund. \n4 When she finally got to the counter, we found out our order was ready, but no one had bothered to tell the counter that it was ready to go.\n5 The order was brought out, looking like food for 5 people was smashed into a bag made for 2 orders. \n6 The clerk offered 5 cinnamon rolls for our inconvenience. Fine. However, the rolls ended up being crammed into the bottom of a larger bag with our original order crammed on top. \n7 the clerk then darted to the back to get us utensils, which for some bizarre reason took another 5 minutes. He also put in utensils for 25 people into the already full bag.\n8 When we finally arrived back at the office, we were treated to one wrong order, room temperature soup and a panini that looked like it had been stepped on. \n\nYes, it was crowded at lunch there, but that's no excuse for horrendous service and terrible communication, especially for an order that had been called in an hour and a half early.\n\nThis Panera location really needs to step up its game.",

The first time I showed up I was told they were closed for a Spring Spruce up and would be open on the 11th. I left a little annoyed because there was no indication of this on their website, which I had used to look them up and browse the menu. I later discovered they had something up on their Facebook page about being closed, but seeing as those I don't have a Facebook, this was of no benefit to me. Today (March 15th) I drove all the way over only to discover a sign on the door stating they will be closed the remainder of the week! This time I checked their Facebook and there was no information regarding the extended closure. In fact it was a bit confusing because they had posts advertising the re-opening and even pictures posted of people eating there for a brunch event just the other day. Is this some kind of secret society of delicious eatery? I really wish I knew. Poor communication on the businesses side of things has made me feel like I probably won't be giving these guys a try. If I do muster up the fortitude to drive clear across town again I will definitely be calling ahead to make sure they are open. I suggest you do the same.",

There were 5 separate appearances. Including under our table and at our feet. We also watched them roam freely into and out from the kitchen.  I used to partake in Honey's brunch nearly every weekend. For YEARS. It is safe to say I will never dine or advertise for this establishment again. When the server was told about the mice issue, he was not only flippant in his response, but made excuses rather than apologize, and charged us for our 2 cups of coffee.",

    "text": "I first want to start off with the fact of how much I love Blaze Pizza. I've been here mmmmm about ten times. Well not this exact location, but nevertheless to Blaze Pizza. Tonight's occasion was Friday pizza night with the kids. What made it even more fantastic was the buy one get one free coupon I retrieved from Facebook. I ended up seeing a friend here who also had the coupon. Before I ordered our food I made sure to ask the cashier, Amanda, if it was buy one get one free for all pizzas or per order. She stated for all pizzas. I went ahead and ordered and added my friends order to ours, just to be nice. Once it was time to check out, the same cashier then said no, you can only have one per order. I purposely ordered four pizzas based one what she told me. I was of course puzzled and frustrated. She then turned to who she called the \"general manager\" and said I can only do one right and he said yes without even looking into what was going on. I tried to get his attention but he ignored me. He was a little busy I will add but when something is happening, tend to it. I told her ma'am I only did it this way because of what you told me but of course she acted oblivious. Totally upset me but I decided to just leave with the bill we were given. I was really upset not because of what happened but because of how it was handled. Rudely and unprofessional!",

I went there based upon the 4.5 star review hoping for a great little sandwich place in the Metairie side of town. The grocery store looked pretty great, but the sandwich bar on a Saturday at lunchtime was abysmal, and the worst place I've paid money to eat since moving here several weeks ago. \n\nThe service consisted of \"What do you want?\" followed by the staff contuing their conversation and offering no help at all. The turkey sandwich my wife bought was shaved lettice and tomato on a plain white hamburger bun. Hardly worth the $7 we paid. My \"hot sausage po boy\" was some kind of pressed mass of orange meat with more shredded \"lettuce\".  The only redeemable thing about the whole meal was the package of cole slaw that made it edible. If you're looking for a grocery store, definitely check it out; but if you're looking for a sandwich or a po boy, pass it by. It's an amateurish half-hearted attempt.",

We discussed eating from it...but decided against it. I haven't been to a CM since the one left the Foothills mall many years ago....I never had any issue with anything at that location. The one on Campbell was not good. Server was polite, but when she came and gave us silverware...it was as if she was playing tiddlywinks...I was a bit perplexed when my three pieces were laid down knife....spoon over knife at a 45 degree angle, then the fork over top the same way...about 6 inches from my napkin. I hadn't thought about it until now...but I feel she was trying in code to tell me not to eat there. Yeah....that has to be it. I looked at the fork...and it looked as if it was taken from the table behind us....as they were using it....it was replaced with a clean one....I am hoping it was anyways...at least there was nothing on it that I could see...and that is 90% of the battle. On to the food. I ordered a chorizo burro. $9.00. This was the driest chorizo I have ever eaten....as my girth with attest.....I have had much chorizo in my life. About three hours after.....I feel yucky. Anyways.....I will not be returning here.",

The first time, everything was great, it was around lunch, the service was fantastic, the food was fantastic and I decided to make it my go to diner. The second time I brought my mother and she ordered a cheese quesadilla, when it came out it was just slices of cheese ONTOP of a folded tortilla, we spoke to the manager about it who told us we were wrong about wanting to order something different. So today I decided to give this place ONE last chance. Came in with my boyfriend and kids. We ordered two Reuben's. One pastrami, one corn beef and we split them as we always have. The kids ordered typical kids meals. When our food came out the Rye was completely under toasted and the fries were not well done. As a server myself I know that the cooks don't always listen to what the ticket said. One of the kids meals was completely over cooked, and the other was under cooked! (Roasted turkey under cooked, chicken fingers over cooked) The manager/host came up to the stand (which was directly behind us) and started coughing very loudly. I turned around to make sure he was ok and he's facing my table and coughing without covering his mouth! At that point I had enough! I politely asked our waitress for a box & the check. When I went up to pay the same manager/host was there to cash me out, didn't even ask how everything was just grabbed the money out of my hand! The entire time I was there the manager/host was yelling at the busser about cleaning tables; from what I saw the busser moved very quickly and there was only one busser from what I saw so yelling at him was uncalled for especially in front of guests! He also yelled across the restaurant several times for \"Ashley\" to come get a beer for another server, instead of just walking his lazy a** the 5 feet to the table it needed to go to! And last but not least, the manager gave me and the kids a dirty look and scoffed when one of the children asked if he could go give our server her tip, which is completely uncalled for and unprofessional! I told him yes but he needed to wait until she was done at the table, which he did. He then waited for her by our table and handed her the tip and smiled. She was very polite to all 4 of us and addressed any and all concerns we had! I'd suggest my server find a job elsewhere, she was absolutely fantastic and the ONLY reason I'm even giving 1 star! I will NEVER be back unless the management changes!!!!! I have been a server for over 10 years now so I know what is expected out of servers, bussers & management and this manager was by far one of the WORST I've ever seen in any restaurant! So to the lovely server with the bandana headband; GET OUT WHILE YOU STILL CAN! You're a great server and plenty of restaurants would be lucky to have you as a part of their company!",

In my opinion, it's crazy,  as well as obnoxious and pretentious borderline thievery.   \n\nIf you purchase their lens protection/replacement guarantee/warrantee option that you have to pay extra for, be warned that there is a big catch as well.

Many other eye glass places I have purchased this plan from didn't require any additional cost(s).\n\nIt's basically nickel and dime cut throat city; and then some.

Keep in mind that don't have a crazy and complicated prescription, and I didn't get all the bells and whistles the first time as well.  \n\nIt's crystal clear that these grotesquely overpriced thieves seriously do not want my business. \nThe guy on the phone basically told me that the company doesn't care and wants to bend me over.

    "text": "My girlfriend and I decided to try Kalamata's last night at around 7:30. The guy at the counter asked us if we're ready to order even before we had the chance to look at the menu properly, not once but multiple times. \n\nWe ordered 2 lamb gyros, a side order of roasted potatoes and the tabouleh. The potatoes came out extremely fast and were lukewarm at best. Either they were premade, and \"microwaved to order\" or were just sitting on a hot plate. Not something I'd expect from any restaurant. \n\nThe tabouleh was SOUR - like salad dunked in a bottle of fish sauce sour. We decided to tell the guy upfront our issues with the tabouleh but all we got out of him was \"This is our recipe. This is the way we make it. It's fine if you don't like it, but this is how we make it\". I agree I have no idea what authentic tabouleh tastes like, or how to make it, but I have tasted GOOD tabouleh in the past, and this was far from it. I pity the people who've eaten tabouleh only at this establishment because they're really missing out. \n\nThe gyros were pedestrian at best, under-seasoned and most of all under-sauced. The veggies were on one side of the pita, the meat on the other - so you'd never get a mouthful of veggies+meat and only one side of the pocket had the sauce. Suspecting another \"This is how we sauce our gyros. This is our recipe\" moment, we decided to finish our food ASAP.\n\nFinally, the worst offense was that the guy starts closing up shop while we're still eating. Really? I've no idea how this place got 4 stars on yelp, but there are way better restaurants in Nashville for Mediterranean food.",

He said they used to be much different and delicious and it has totally gone downhill. It was dry, crusty and hard cheese, no sauce, tasted like a piece of bread with lettuce and tomatoes on it.

    "text": "I'm so disappointed. The GM of this location called me and wanted to make things better after my first review. She offered me a free order of whatever I wanted and promised they would do right by me. Pleased with this communication, I made an order a few weeks later, but when the delivery arrived, it was wrong (yet again). I got a regular 2-Liter Coke, instead of Diet Coke. The driver said he had a diet coke in the car, then I watched him drive away. I was not sure if he was coming back! About 15 minutes later, he showed up again with a diet coke for me. I have literally ordered from this location three times, and each time have been disappointed. \n\nMy recommendation? Order from another Domino's location, or drive yourself there to pick it up. Their drivers struggle with accuracy and quality (quality meaning pizzas that have slid around in the box to the point of getting smooshed).",

The beans and rice were bland as well. They were out of steak, so we mistakenly tried pork skin. Imagine eating diced slugs stuffed in a soft tortilla that keeps falling apart. Now pretend that moment in time never happened and you didn't waste your money on something that traumatizing.\n\nYeah...not as easy as you'd think.\n\nI was really looking forward to the hole-in-the-wall authenticity, but I was sorely lead astray by previous reviews of this place.\n\nJust don't do it.",

OK - I understand some sound a bit more specialty, like chocolate iced raspberry filled, double dark chocolate, cinnamon apple filled, and powdered blueberry filled. But they literally didn't have ANY powdered sugar donuts at all, no maple glazed anything, no lemon filled anything. And when I commented about them not having much, I got attitude back from the girl behind the counter telling me they had everything except for maybe one or two donuts. It's one thing to not have many routine donuts. It's another to have bad attitude. But to have both? One star it is.",

We tried the bowls at the Juice Merchant but thought they were just okay, so we were excited when Boostin' Bowls opened up in Manayunk.  We tried both the Boostin' and the PB&J bowls.  The acai they use is a puree that comes from a box and blended with ice, so after a few minutes of eating, the entire bowl becomes a bland, watery mess with very little taste (or the benefits!) of actual acai.  Even though it cost us over $25, we ended up throwing half of it away and went somewhere else for breakfast.  Not sure where they learned to make acai bowls, but I don't think you're supposed to blend ice with the acai.  We make far better bowls at home with the frozen acai packs you can get from Whole Foods.  So if you want a real acai bowl, you'll need to go to the Juice Shack in OCMD or our house--not here.",

Waiters and waitresses all around spent more time cleaning table tops with spray bottles and filthy cloths in their hands then tending to present customers eating their meal. No consideration. Music blaring. Kids running wild on Kids Eat-Free -Night.  Poor choice in seating - ppl without children seated right next to the Free Color and Scribble Table\n ( didn;t know it was kids night until too late. Awful. Never again)  Worse than a poorly run loud cafeteria vibe with roaming , unsupervised kids.  Waiter forgot to bring an ordered side dish, yet had it on the bill, of course. Took extra time to remove it. Lighting was much too bright. Food was mediocre to taste.  Overall disappointing, and will not go back.",

    "text": "I know that Pi is a popular place, and that it gets packed in the loop, especially on Friday and Saturday nights.  Since they don't take reservations for 2 people, and being the smart yelper that I am, I called first to check on the wait.  They said that by the time I came in, there would be no wait, especially because the concert at the Pageant was about to start.  So the bf and I headed down there 10 min later, and he dropped me off so I wouldn't have to walk in the cold (what a gentleman).  I walked in, and the snooty hostesses told me there was a 40 min wait.  Um there is NO WAY all of those people just showed up in 10 min.  Clearly someone fudged the truth to get me to come in.  And there wasn't a single seat or place to stand in the bar or the tiny waiting area.  I tried to call him to tell him not to park and walk down (he would probably have to walk pretty far) but he wasn't paying attention to his phone, so he never got the message.   He walked in, took one look, and I knew we were both on the same page.  I politely told the hostesses that they could cross off our name, and then waited by the door while he pulled the car around.  They proceeded to stare at me very obviously and whisper during this time, until I left, which  is bad business, whether you're a catty hostess that still thinks she is in high school (or maybe still is), or a hostess raving about how fabulous my outfit is.  Either way girls, it's rude.\n\nDon't get me wrong...the pizza here is good.  But it's no mystic pizza.  And it isn't the only pizza place around.  This story has a happy ending though.  We went to Dewey's, were promptly seated, experienced the best service there, as we always do, and left with full bellies, probably way before we would've even gotten our pizza at Pi. \n\nNever again.",

    "text": "I've had two experiences with limoncello that we're both horrible service and have made me not want to come back...ever. First was my birthday dinner in late summer. It was very crowded and my friend and I were wedged into a tiny table in a window with a huge family party on the other side of us - we felt stuck in a little alcove, not to mention it was very loud. We ordered an appetizer of the fried calamari, and it did not come out in 20-30 minutes. When we asked about it, they said it would be right out, but our entrees came out first! \n\nThen, they had the nerve to ask us if we still wanted our appetizer. We said that we did, and it eventually showed up. They did not offer to take it off of our bill, and they seemed so busy that our dissatisfaction was the least of their worries. Our meal was definitely overpriced for the service we received. \n\nMy second experience was with their catering dept. I wanted to have limoncello cater my wedding. I called in October, made an appointment to come into the restaurant the first week in November to sample food and discuss my vision. They called and cancelled the same day due to a family emergency (which I totally understand!). But then I didn't hear from them in over a week to reschedule! I finally reached out and was told that I could make an appointment for January. JANUARY!?!?! I never responded and never went back. \n\nHorrible customer service in both situations.",

You thought that the word \"layers\" meant more than one?  You thought that b\u00e9chamel was a sauce?  You thought Parmesan cheese usually could be seen or when melted looked like it had been grated rather than an overdone mashed potato.\n\nWhen I asked the waiter, he said that those were not mashed potatoes, it was solid b\u00e9chamel, that they no longer put a liquid sauce on the dish.  I asked him why the menu said sauce and he just shrugged his shoulders.   Several minutes later the manager came by, offered the same lame story and offered to bring me something else.  When asked about the potatoes, just looked at me as if to say, you should have known Pastichio has potatoes.\n\nBy this time, I was and am pissed off that I was told twice I should have guessed about the mashed potatoes, and that b\u00e9chamel was not a sauce.\n\nMy cousin's Pasta Angelo was supposed to have \"grilled\" chicken, it was baked or cooked on a flat top.  The sauce was ok.\n\nMy wife enjoyed the Chicken Piccata.",

    "text": "Disappointing experience. Pastries (had the croissant, eclair, cannoli) are okay but nothing amazing. Dining area is small. Very limited drink options. I agree with previous reviews that it is very reminiscent of break-room coffee with 2 pump pots full of coffee and buy-in-bulk tea bags.  \n\nReally what soured the experience was the counter staff.  After my SO and I purchased several pastries, coffee, tea and went to sit down, the staff informed us that we couldn't stay because they were closing. The sign says 5pm, this was at 4pm.  She assured us that it was just that day they were closing early.   No apology. Just informed us and walked away. After all this, I had to remind her that I was still waiting for a cup of hot water to steep my warehouse earl grey tea in. We came to the cafe to sit and enjoy tea and pastries so it was obviously a disappointment to get kicked out before the advertised closing time.  I would have greatly appreciated being informed of the earlier hours prior to making a purchase or at least in the form of a sign. Would much rather enjoy a pre-made croissant and better drink options at the adjacent Starbucks or PJs. Lesson learned.",

We ordered our food at 6pm- so we could leave by 7, for a movie that started at 7:20. None of us ordered anything fancy- chicken fingers, a wrap, a sandwich. At 6:50 our food finally came, and we quickly had to scarf it down in order to leave. (We did let our server know we were headed to the movies after dinner, there was only 5 of us) This was extremely disappointing, even though they offered is boxes to take with us...which honestly, we couldn't even do since we would be at a movie for a few hours. \n\n\nWe expressed our disappointment to the \"Manager,\" who never even looked up, made eye contact, or engaged in a conversation when we shared with her our experience. All she said was \"I gave you a little something off\"- Which was $1.50 off the entire check. It wasn't even the discount that irked me- We were looking for someone to validate and at least pretend they were concerned about our experience, and even that was too difficult to do. \n\nI would just eat at the theater or head to Red Robbins if you're looking for a quick bite to eat. Apparently, the fry times for Friendlies chicken fingers, fries, etc exceed over 20 minutes.",

Then we ordered a Pina Colada instead, but they didn't have the mix for that either. We each ordered the prime rib and got mashed potatoes with it. When I tried to send mine back for a baked potato I was told that they don't serve baked potatoes on Sunday. I also wanted creamed horseradish and was informed that they might possibly be out of that as well, so I asked for sour cream to mix with the straight horseradish. By this time the bartender (subbing as a waitress) was becoming visibly agitated with my persistent requests.  I was planning to order 2 additional prime rib dinners to take home to my husband and son-in-law, but I wasn't about to give this place any more money for their poor choices and now an attitude from a food server.  So I phoned in my order to the Outback Steakhouse where (for the same money) we got our choice of potatoes, AND choice of vegetable, AND we also got warm baked bread.",

I walked in and everyone was just sitting around doing nothing, they were on their phones and not even asking if we needed help. I literally had to bother one of the representatives to even look at me and when she finally did, she just gave me this look like, \"what the fuck does this little girl want?\" I'm a college student and my phone was stolen two nights ago so I went in to get a new phone. When I explained what happened and that my mom had already spoken to a verizon customer service rep who told us it would only cost 100, she laughed in my face and told me about all these extra charges that would make it closer to 200. Then when I had her explain the extra charges and information to my mom over the phone, she was completely rude and soooo disrespectful. Granted, my mom can be a bit abrasive at times but I was listening to the entire conversation and it did not warrant the response that Brenda (the sales rep) had. My mom was talking about how she had received different information than what Brenda had told her, this bitch actually held the phone away from her face IN FRONT OF ME. How dumb could you be?! My friend and I also overheard her talking about how irritating my mom was being when she went into the back room and even 30 feet away from us. She made several remarks and comments about my mom and the information she was \"trying to make her understand,\" and I was literally infuriated. Then once I had paid for my phone I was on my friends phone telling my mom the total and explaining the process etc and Brenda didnt even say have a nice day or goodbye once the sale was finished, she simply walked into the back room without anther word. I told one of the other very nice sales women that I was very disappointed and she seemed more sincere than the lady who had worked with me. I really wish I'd spoken to her instead. So basically, DO NOT GET BRENDA. Unless you feel like getting irritated and pissed off!",

Thought that would transfer to this location - not at all.\n\nTo sum it up, our server was extremely energetic, but not in a good way. More like a frantic energy. I was there to enjoy a few drinks and dinner with a friend who was visiting (AKA looking to spend money AKA you will get a larger tip if you let us stay longer) and we were rushed out. Server brought boxes for food we were still eating, without asking if we wanted them. A few minutes later he physically put the food in the boxes at the tableside while mumbling something like \"I don't like food sitting on the table.\" .....we didn't even want to take it home. Next, when we said we were having another friend join for another round or two of drinks he told us we couldn't stay at the booth we were at and we needed to go to the bar. What? I point blank asked him if he was kicking us out of the booth and he said \"yes!\" energetically. There was no one waiting for tables and there were numerous open tables/booths around the restaurant. I felt extremely uncomfortable and wanted to leave immediately. Our friend joined after all this happened, and when the server came over to ask if they wanted a drink, he seemed surprised when we told him we were just going to leave. YOU LITERALLY just told us we couldn't sit at this table any longer!! We then left.\n\nI worked in restaurants for a long time and I'm pretty easy to please when it comes to restaurant service. I was not pleased at all during this visit.\n\nOn another note, the food was not that great.",

Second, don't ever eat here. Did I already say that? By far the worst food I have ever eaten, ten notches below middle school cafeteria food. Pizza tasted like cardboard. They claim to have \"Sicilian\" pizza but more looked like a oval cheese board. Freezer fries would taste better than what they served which were string fries. They don't include marinara sauce with mozz sticks. Only positive, friendly service on the phone from a young woman.",

We sat at that booth for 17 minutes with absolutely no contact with an employee.  We walked out.  Since this new location opened, we've dined as a family dozens of times with great results.  Tonight I entered by myself.  Seated near the bar at a four top, I sat at my table for nine minutes...no one, nothing.  So, again, I walk out to the prepubescent hostesses thanking me for coming.

    "text": "Seriously the worst food I've had in a long time. I stopped coming to red lobster... due to the fact you can go to ANY steak & seafood restaurant... and they will charge you the same price for FRESH DELICIOUS FOOD!   This was just sad!!!! Our bill was 110$ for 2 people and it was horrible.    I didn't order broccoli... but the servers had a large birthday party... so I really felt like they just rushed when with us.  I hate broccoli. When she brought out the food which was steak Nd a lobster tail.. she brought out my medium well steak that was cooked all the way thru. It was dry and flavorless.  And the lobster tail was tough, dry and just gross.   I asked her for some ranch , butter; and lemon. So I could drown my food. Considering it was near closing I didn't want to ask for anything to be remade... however they could have offered us something off the bill.    By the time she came back with the sauce I asked for at least 10 mins had passed. My lobster was cold to the touch.  Oh on top of they didn't serve my mash potatoes until 10 mins after my entree. For 10 mins my dry food sat on the table and got cold because it was disgusting and dry!       It was still nasty after I drown it in sauce. All I ate was the rice(that I had to ask for after she brought out the dry old looking broccoli) and the mash potatoes. Which we paid more for lobster Mac but was brought out the smallest portion I've ever seen.    I've ordered it before and never gotten a portion this Small.     I'm also PRETTY POSITIVE Our meal came with a salad. Matter fact I KNOW. Because we've ordered the same thing before. They never even brought us OUR SALAD!      Seriously i will never step foot in this place AGAIN! Ohh and Everytime I come in here either the manager is arguing with employees. Or a customer is arguing with the wait staff for their bad service.",

    "text": "One word to describe this place - AWFUL. I ordered take out from here a few weeks ago. It was a Sunday night, around 7 o'clock. They told me to pick it up in 30 minutes (I ordered a grilled chicken sandwich with lettuce and tomato and Maria's sandwich which consists of prosciutto, mozzarella, and tomato). I thought 30 minutes was a little excessive but figured they were probably busy with dinner service. So I arrive to pick up my food about 35-40 minutes later. Not one car in the parking lot, not one person in the restaurant area and I'm told my food is STILL not ready. I ended up waiting an additional 15 minutes for a piece of grilled chicken and a COLD sandwich. The grilled chicken should not take too long on the grill and the other sandwich didn't even require cooking!! The girl at the front desk was not apologetic at all. The cook came out 3 times to talk/flirt with the girls at the front desk. All around it was very unprofessional. \n\nSo I get home to try my sandwich and was not pleased at all. The grilled chicken sandwich was literally a piece of flavorless chicken served on a hamburger bun. Yes, a hamburger bun. The other sandwich was not for me but I had to try it. Again, flavorless. I will not be going back here ever again. For the record, this was probably my 3rd or 4th time ordering from here only due to the fact that it's right down the street from me, and every time I've had to wait a long time for food and/or the food was not good. I've eaten at the other location in Conshohocken before and have been pleased but this location is horrible. Save your time and order elsewhere.",

Dry chicken in a southwest salad, bland quesadilla,  very average burger but all at higher prices than normal. Asked for hot sauce and server came to table 3 times and made excuses each time of why he did not have with him.

Upon arriving, I asked the cashier \"If you were in my shoes, what would it take to make this order worth it, considering that the pizza will be 40-50 minutes old by the time we get home?\" The cashier's response was to assure me that delivery customer's pizzas were at least this old by the time they received them.

It was not the godfathers of yesteryear .Remember when there was more than one and it was GOOD??? Not so much now. The interior was dark gloomy and not so clean the one employee looked like he was counting the hours till his shift was over.long story short this isn't the place for pizza anymore..",

    "text": "No one likes a bad review, I personally get offended by them myself when I read them about my place of work . But one thing I have learned , a bad review can only help a company better themselves . I enjoy Izzos & their food ! Anytime my co workers suggest eating there for lunch I always jump on the izzos bandwagon! This particular time I asked my co worker to pick up a side of guacamole from there for me . My favorite thing to eat from there . I won't lie , I eat slow and I pick through my food the entire time . After taking a few bites of the guacamole I noticed something oddly shaped mixed into the guacamole. I stopped engaging with my co workers at lunch and looked in shock. It was the \"butt end\" of a roach . Lol ! I thought I was seeing things because this recently happened to me at another restaurant about 7 months ago ! I looked again and realized it was indeed just that . I showed my co workers Just to confirm I was correct. I totally get it , it's a restaurant and sometimes ... Bugs get inside . Things like this DO happen . It wasn't their fault & I'm sure they try their best to keep things sanitized. But no one wants pieces of a roach in their food that they've been eating . All I can ask is that they keep a better eye on things ! Sadly I do not think I will be eating at any location Izzos again :(  .",

We asked if we could order off that menu after sitting down and we were told it was \"against the rules.\" The food was ok and the portions were very small. The bar was full and the tables had ample seating. As we were leaving the hostess with braids asked us sarcastically if \"we had good food despite not being able to order a burger.\"  The whole experience rubbed me the wrong way. A bit too pretentious for a restaurant that has been open all of 1 month. If you get reservations and are craving a burger go ahead and cancel them and walk to the bar. Or go to any of the other exceptional options available in the area.",

    "text": "How to even begin to describe the let total let down that was lunch today.  First, had to call back 3 times before we could place order, they just didn't seem to have any of the favorites.  Fine, so finally it became a conversation about \"well, what do you have?\" Please note, it's not like we called at 2:28 for lunch, it was a reasonable 11:45 or so.  Second, delivery was ridiculously late, maybe being from NYC I have higher expectations so I'll give them a pass on that...maybe.  Third and the final straw, the food was HORRIBLE!!!!! I don't even understand how they felt that what they sent out was acceptable.  How does a Dominican restaurant screw the most basic thing-Rice.  It was stale and crunchy...and not in a bibimbap way....which I love but not with my chicken stew that was void of everything but chicken.  The only redeeming item were the sweet plantains and I assume that was because it didn't require much intervention from the chef.  \nWas this just an unusually bad day for a restaurant that thus far has been pretty good? I don't know but it will be quite a while before I return to find out.",

The food has severely gone downhill in not only quality of ingredients but also in ability to prepare a dish. I ate here for lunch today, saying that so hopefully a member of the staff reads this and remembers me, I ordered the dry hot pot and my gf ordered fried dumplings and the cold noodles with chili oil and we shared each other's food. The mushrooms in my dish were impossible to cut even with a knife and the rest of the vegetables had a freeze dried feel to them being the consistency of bark. The pork was a bit rubbery and only had flavor from the oil draped over everything that seemed under seasoned as well and definitely tasted old. This was labeled in the menu as a 10/10 spicy rating, it was at most a 2. I didn't bother saying anything because of how rude the waiter/host was, but I'll get to that. The rice was cold and clumped together in chunks that led me to understand that it was previously microwaved. The dumplings looked ok, but the dough was undercooked and the sauce was just soy sauce that had no care whatsoever put into it. Her noodles were very bland and whoever prepared them obviously doesn't care about their food. The noodles had the same flavor deprived oil from my dish in it, just disappointing really. This type of food is supposed to be robust and I've eaten at a ton of places across the country and internationally that do care about what the put out. This place doesn't care anymore. The man that seated us was incredibly rude the entire time. He huffed and puffed and stomped his feet when I asked for the real Chinese menu instead of the Americanized Chinese menu. And, they used to throw shade if you asked for the Americanized menu, now it's the opposite. After we were done we both had a decent amount of food left and I decided to take it to feed to the raccoons that come around my house. They look cool and I like to feed them. Anyway, the take out container was dirty from previous food in it! I was blown away, especially when I pointed it out and the rude person pretending to be a man grabbed it out of my hand and stormed, literally stormed off before I was even half way through my sentence. I was calm the whole time, not sure what this guys deal is. Then came back with the same container that he washed! He washed the dirty container that should never have been used in the first place and thought that was acceptable. I will never go here again and I hope they go out of business so no one has to be punished by this Handy Nasty food. Disgusting food and disgusting people, except for the one guy who worked there who said goodbye to us. He seemed mortified because he knew what the cuck host just did to everyone in the dining area throughout the day and I assume throughout his life. I hate this place, and I can only hate it because I used to love it.",

    "text": "My friend and I decided to have lunch at Mr. B's on Memorial Day. The atmosphere is moderately upscale. Fortunately for us, there was no long line or crowd, so we got seated immediately. \n\nFor the most part the servers were nice, however our waitress could have improved her customer service etiquette.\n \nMy first issue with the waitress began after I asked her to clean the bread crumbs from the table ... (Side note: the bread is served from a bag, it's light and crispy on the outside and airy  on the inside... It tastes good but easily crumbles) \nThe waitress wiped the table but left a considerable amount of crumbs on the table ... Afterward, the waitress called me a \"neat freak\" , not once but twice ... The neat freak comment was completely inappropriate. \n\nSecond, the waitress was unfamiliar with the menu. She did not seem to know whether or not the shrimp in the various dishes was deveined. \n\nMy third issue was with waiting 40 minutes for the crab cake appetizer. One crab cake is $18. The crab cake was actually good and savory, but it was disappointing waiting 40 minutes for one crab cake ... \n\nOur main course arrived about 15 minute after the crab cake. \n\nI ordered the shrimp and angel hair pasta. The buttery taste overwhelmed the dish. Since the dish lacked acidity, I requested lemons from the waitress. The taste of the pasta was not a big deal ... Nothing a little lemon juice couldn't fix. \n\nMy fourth issue was with the waitress bringing the small cut lemons from the bar, instead of lemon wedges ... \n\nThe lemon cuts were so small that I was unable to squeeze lemon juice from the lemons ...\n\nOverall, I wanted to enjoy Mr. B's more than I did... I have no plans of returning.",

    "text": "I originally would have given Red Robin 3 stars, but my last experience three weeks ago was so terrible that I just can't do that anymore.  My server was one of the worst I've ever had.  I just can not bring myself to go back for fear of getting the same guy and having this experience all over again. \n\n    Here is the breakdown:  First, he took forever to come to our table and even take our drink order.  I was about to get up and leave.  It had been at least ten or fifteen minutes before he ever acknowledged us at the table and the place wasn't even crowded!  It was a weeknight.  I could understand if it was a busy weekend and the place was packed, but I've been there on a busy weekend as well, and have not been treated like that.  However, I have on a weekday by a different server, but that's another story, and I left happy because a nice other waitress remedied the situation.  Anyway, this guy finally takes our order and then takes another ten minutes to bring me my water and then starts to walk off again.  I tell him that I would like to order.  I tell him which burger I want and that I want it to be a turkey burger, and with no mayo.  He looks really confused and takes about 3 minutes to write that down.  Then he repeats the name of the burger.  I say, \"Yes, with turkey and no mayo please.\"  He starts writing again for what seems like forever and then my boyfriend tries to order.  Then he starts to walk away and my boyfriend says, \"I'd like it medium-well, please.\"  He looked confused and was like, \"oh...\"   Then he asked me, \"How about you?  Medium well?\"  I said, \"Mine is turkey, so I would like that cooked properly please.\"  He said, \"Well, they're going to ask me how you like it cooked.\"  I said, \"165 degrees please, which is the temperature turkey should be cooked to in order to be cooked properly.\"  He tried to argue with me about it and then kind of laughed and walked away.  That is a health hazard under-cooking poultry!   What is wrong with this guy?  I don't think this guy knew anything about food or had ever waited tables in his life.\n\n    Then, I finally get my food thirty minutes later and it is slathered in mayonnaise. I try to get his attention for a while, but he ignores me, and I am so hungry at this point and this want to leave this place because this guy is annoying me that I just rip the top half off, wipe it off with my napkin and try to eat part of it.  He comes back about 20 minutes later when I'm about done and was like oh was it good.  I told him about the mayo and he said, \"Well, I didn't know that.\"  Then he just walked away!  Weird! He didn't say he was sorry and acted like it was my fault even though I'd repeated it twice when I ordered!  So rude too!  Finally, we couldn't get him to bring the check and had to flag him down again.  I thought I would never get out of that place!  It was the worst service I have received in a very long time.  Although I enjoy Red Robin's turkey burger, this service really turned me off to the place.  A lot of time will have to pass before I consider giving it a go again, if I ever do.",

    "text": "I have to admit I'm surprised by my experience. When I saw this place had over 200 ratings and a 4.5 average I expected something more than what I got.  I ordered the falafel platter which came with Tabouleh salad, hummus, mixed vegetables & a side of pita.\n\nAs a whole, everything seemed to be at least a day old. Everything was very stale and just did not feel right as you attempted to chew it.  If I ever storm a castle and have archers firing at me from atop a tower, I would like to be wearing armor made from the falafel because I would be unstoppable.  The pita, I would not serve to small children nor the elderly because it's a choking hazard. It had the consistency of that fruit leather you used to get from the cafeteria in elementary school. \n\nYou know how if you put a lot of sugar in your coffee people make that joke \"You want some coffee with your sugar?\" Well that's what they would say about the amount of parsley in the Tabbouleh.  I understand Tabbouleh is supposed to have a lot of parsley, but this was to the point where I couldn't call it Tabbouleh.  They just gave me straight up minced parsley with a countable amount bulgur grains that seem to have accidentally fallen in.\n\nThe hummus was not that bad. It tasted like it had a bit too much lemon juice going on and maybe could have used a bit more tahini, but overall it was just ok.\n\nThe overall taste of everything was not bad, but it did not resemble anything that I would call close to good. Think of a delicious cheesesteak from Pat's or Gino's or Dalessandro's that's a day or two old.  It would taste like it's a day or two old, but you could still tell that it would have been delicious had it been fresh. I can't say that with the meal I just had from Smiley's.  It didn't taste bad like I could not stand putting it into my mouth, but I can't say I found it even pleasant. I'd get as excited for it as I would for a plain bowl of oatmeal made with water.\n\nI think I rate very fairly and it hurts me that I have to give this establishment such a low rating. I will admit that there is a possibility that, given the other stellar reviews, I may have just had a rare bad experience. Unfortunately, that is all I have to go off of. I may try it again some day if I'm with somebody who really wants to go there.  Until then, no thanks.",

The next day I went and picked up an order since everyone kept talking about how good the food is. Walked in and was never approached by anyone.

After looking at me up and down and giving me a dirty look she got my food and cashed me out. I asked her for a receipt and you would think it was the end of the world. She went in the back and didn't come back for almost 10 minutes with my receipt. The food was ok.

The Foodery has not!\n\nThis Foodery still hasn't decided whether it wants to be a bodega or a bottle shop, which in a store that small means that there's not a lot of room to walk around. Once you get more than 5 people in the store, you're literally pressed up against each other as you try to open the fridge doors. If you go before 4pm, you'll have room to shop, but the staff the works during the day don't know shit about beer, including one woman who doesn't drink beer at all. The night time staff is more on the ball.\n\nThere are literally dozens of other bottle shops now that have better selection and lower prices (Beer Heaven, Beer Love, the Bottle Shop, Pennsport Beer Boutique, the Beer Peddlers, etc.), so it's not worth it to pay the extra $5-$10 per bottle unless you're really, really lazy.

I had hoped it would be a place that I could carry out from often, but I was thoroughly disappointed. All said, the food was OK, but the experience was absolutely horrible.

Upon entering we were yelled at to shut the door (we were literally just crossing the threshold when the waiter snapped at us) and then he took menus and literally threw them on a table and walked away. We waited for over 10 minutes before anyone ever greeted the table and the only reason anyone ever came was because I had to flag down another server when she walked passed us (and another table who had been seated just before us who also had no server) to greet a table who just walked in. Our server was the same guy who yelled at us earlier and when I suggested to my sister that she order her food with her drink he said \"yeah lets just get this all over with at once\". The burger was disgusting, it looked like a McDonalds hamburger but greasier. I just got coffee so I can't say I tasted it but if it had been served to me I would have returned it. I had to flag the server down for the check and when I put my card out to be taken (everyone else was paying in cash) he walked by literally six times without taking the card. I ended up just paying cash. I have served my entire college career so I understand what the job is like but to be blatantly hostile is something I will never understand. Yes, we are tourists just like probably 90% of the restaurant (it was Sugar bowl weekend so the team colors gave it away) but that is no excuse to treat people so poorly.

    "text": "So utterly upset with this place. Never before has an establishment aggravated me so. It is a 90 minute wait to get in. They said we will call you when table ready. We got in after 1 hr wait. During that hour we sat in a hot entry way with a squeaky door..no air condition with weather in hot humid 90s. After 45 mins, I ordered coffee from walk up bar.  They got it wrong..has to wait to remake. There was water pooled up in front of coffee station..no one was mopping it. Finally get seated outside counter. We gave order right away because we wanted to check in at our hotel and enjoy some pool time.  We waited, waited, waited..after 1 hour we asked for manager...They finally brought food like 1p min later. The manager was nice, took 25% off..gave us coupons for next time but we won't be back. Our server gave us tude when she brought bill and upon our leaving. I normally do not complain but although the food is supposed to be part of Nashville's finest, the management here is severely lacking to keep up with demand. Tgey also should afford air condition. We finally got to our hotel pool at our $400 a night hotel at 3p because of this place. Thanks Milk & Honey for ruining a huge part of our Nashville vacation.",

We were waiting for the line to die down at two other places but came across Creole House on the way to French quarter. The line was short and it was only a 20 minute wait. I am an oyster fiend. Living in NYC I got oysters every other night enjoying 2-3 dozens by myself. Thinking the oysters would be delicious , I ordered 2 dozens and so did my sister. We also shared a cup of gumbo. My sisters friend had a shrimp po boy with fries. After half a dozen oysters I started to feel nauseous. I didn't want to waste any oysters so I suffered though the first dozen. My sister has a strong stomach and finish 1.5 dozen. I couldn't eat anymore. The gumbo was terrible. It had no flavor, it was so tiny for 7 dollars(we had way better gumbo at another place the day after for way less). We had a taste of the po boy as well. It was just ok. My sisters friend didn't finish it either. The fries came fresh out the freezer I'm sure. Dry and scrawny little things. Should've just gone to French quarter and ate at one of the other places. Probably would've been better since the lines were longer. Would've been worth the wait. What a waste of money. And stomach space.",

I have to have heavy whipping cream in place because I can't drink my coffee black. As soon as we sat down our waitress came over and said that because of a health hazard she had to take my coffee and give it back to me when we left. I explained to her why I brought it with me and she offered me milk or cream (can't have it). I was pissed. I'm pretty sure this is just a ploy to make you buy coffee from them which probably has a huge profit margin. The food is nothing special but, because of my coffee incident, we will never come here again.

Basically, they skipped my App order with another web order that was placed after mine AND the person entered the restaurant as I was waiting for my order. I would've been fine if the manager apologized for the oversight and stated that he would go ahead and make it (by now, 3 more people had come in and my ticket was still in the wall), but he did not. He accused me of getting \"feisty\" with him. I asked for my money back and he apologized to the person behind me (who's order they bumped in front of mine) for the wait while he processed my return. I believe an issue of poor training and managerial skills. The customer is what drives a business and not apologizing for oversights and using derogatory terms is not conducive the brand. I emailed corporate and they offered me a coupon for a free meal. Not satisfied.",

    "text": "I've been here a handful of times, and bagels have always been delicious. I visited the shop on 5/19/18, and this will be my last visit. I went there because I was hungry and in need of food, but it seemed like I walked into the middle of classic P.T. Barnum show: clowns juggling while riding unicycles and elephants parading around on their hind legs. The first employee I interacted with, at the \"bulk\" bagel counter, didn't hesitate to let me know that I was attempting to order from the wrong location. Fair enough. They did have a sign on the counter, but it wasn't as conspicuous as an \"order here\" sign that dangles from the ceiling. Her tone made it clear to me that I had already committed one transgression. I then order from the attendant at the POS. I clarified my complicated order of a breakfast sandwich and two toasted everything bagels with a tomato and garlic cream cheese, three times. The first clarification was that I wanted everything bagels, not plain. The second  clarification was directed toward me because they actually have garlic and herb cream cheese, not garlic cream cheese. The third was my reiteration of the tomato and the quantity of the said bagels. At this point I had more confidence in a drunk ESL Uber driver getting me home safely than my order being prepared as per my request. After waiting for my extravagant order to be prepared to imperfection and gazing at the yellow ceiling grid with stalactites of black dust, my name was called and the first employee I interacted with hastily handed me my bagel bag. On the ride home I asked my partner in crime to ensure that there were 3 bagels in the bag because they probably \"F-ed\" the order up. He assured me that the quantity was correct. When I got home, I feverishly ripped open the wrapping on the two everything bagels, like a joyous child on Christmas Day, only to find     that the bagels had the tomatoes omitted and the cream cheese barely exceeded a skim coat. The breakfast sandwich was anemic at best with barely any protein on it. I am so glad that I expected disappointment. Honestly I'm not too upset because closer to my house there is a new bagel shop: Red House bagels, where the staff is courteous, the shop is cleaner, and the bagels a bit larger. Red House is my new bagel stop.  Sorry Newtown Bagel Co, you've been replaced. Although your actual bagels are slightly better tasting, it is not enough to reconcile the pain points associated with your operations. My words of advice, replace (don't clean) your ceiling tiles and clean the filth from the grid. Having almost 10 years of food and beverage experience, I would hate to see what your walk-in and floors behind the counter look like. Coach your employees on courteous service, or maybe treat them better and they might pass that on to your patrons. Oh and maybe write the orders down before entering them into the POS, because sometimes those machines aren't as navigable for some operators. I'd like to keep going on about this, but I am probably beating an already abused P.T. Barnum animal.",

    "text": "Being a female I've never had to deal with tux shops until I/we started planning our wedding but you always hear the 'horror' stories of tuxes not fitting, pieces missing, pieces being dirty, stained, or damaged, somebody being charged for something, etc., so I was hoping we were one of the lucky ones that came out on the other side unscathed.  \n\nThe planning process wasn't a grueling experience at all.  With 10 additional men in the wedding spanning 3 different states, it was extremely convenient for everybody to handle their tux at whatever location was most convenient for them.  Having any one of the other 10 tuxes be compromised in any way (wrong fit, dirty, damaged, missing pieces, etc.) would be an inconvenience and obviously not ideal for a wedding that you pay huge bucks for everything to be perfect.  During the 2 months leading up to the wedding all 11 men went in and got fitted on time with only a few of them needing alterations or different sizes, my husband's being one of them (just one piece of the tux was wrong).  The rest of the guys picked theirs up with no problem, which left them to screw up the one tux that actually mattered most.  When my husband went in the day before the wedding to pick up his tux they couldn't give it to him because they didn't have it.  With only one piece of the tux needing to be replaced earlier in the week, they somehow managed to lose or send out the whole tux.  My husband mentioned that they weren't even very apologetic about it, just that that was that and they'd overnight the tux so that it was to them by the morning.  \n\nOur wedding was a couple hours away so my husband had to miss out on a couple things with some of our family and friends because he had to wait at home to pick up his tux the morning of our wedding and then drive all the way to the where our wedding in time for the photographer, etc.  \n\nFast forward a couple weeks and we get a card in the mail \"Congratulations on your wedding.  I personally would like to thank you for choosing Men's Wearhouse for your special day.  From all of us here, good luck and congratulations!\" - \"Jason\".  I instantly take notice to 2 very obvious things....  1-) Where's the apology? And 2-) The 12 year old chicken scratch that wrote the card was not Jason, the person who signed it.  Different print, different color ink.  \"I PERSONALLY would like to thank you....\" ....not so personal anymore is it?\n\nSomewhat of a slap in the face that they didn't somehow take note to their screw up and at least follow up with us via a phone call to make sure everything went well and to offer an apology.  Also a slap in the face that Jason Hartley, an \"Operations Manager\", couldn't even write a card himself, given the circumstances.  \n\nTo say I'm annoyed by this, would be an understatement.  I WILL say, however, that Jason is lucky my husband didn't tell me about all of this until after the tux was in hand and en route to the wedding (and on time) the morning of our wedding because otherwise, he wouldn't have gotten off so easily.",

So a group of us went in for Valentine's Day, we had a reservation for 8 and were sat by 845, no big deal we were just a bit cranky and hungry. The host was very nice and was trying her best. \n We finally get sat and get drinks ordered and Our appetizers. It's going well, our server was nice and we were happy. Now this is where it goes down hill. Our appetizers come out about 5-10 mins apart. We brushed it off. A party that got sat after us were now getting their entrees? We start getting irritable at this time we've been in the restaurant for 2 hours. We finally start getting out entrees. 5 people are missing theirs. Sever comes over tells our friend their out of what she wanted. Would've been nice to know before everyone stared receiving their food. But she got to pick whatever she wanted for free, not bad. Everyone is now done with their meals and My friend beside me never got her food. By this time the restaurant is basically empty. The manager comes over and just goes \" what did you have\" my friend told her then she just walked away. No apology. Nothing. Her food finally comes out and she asks our sever why was she just now receiving her food? He replies with \"oh you know the kitchen gets slammed, things happen\" our jaws nearly hit the floor. Granted they comped her meal. But everything was poorly executed and the manager never stopped by to apologize, our server never apologized. \n  I guessed they assumed that they were gonna go down in flames cause they thought passing out a $5 off coupon for next time would do anything. Safe to say we spent 3 hours in a restaurant for a lousy experience. The food was decent but not worth it. Like the saying goes \" you can fix lousy food with great service but you can't fix lousy service with great food\" and we don't ever, ever plan on coming back here. I get that it was Valentine's Day and it was busy, completely understood but it's the mangers job to smooth over the situation. Comping the food is great but that doesn't fix anything.

Avoid it like the plague. \n\nWe didn't even get to ordering the food before we left in intimidation.\n\nSo, we had ordered coffee, someone ordered decaf, but then changed her mind to decaf. Our waitress brought both decaf and regular. When we pointed out the confusion, in a very understanding way (really making sure that she knew that we totally see how the confusion had occurred). This lady got angry! Left me speaking half way through and gave me her back, she came back with another thing of regular coffee, and started to bang our silverware on the table with a face of complete discontent. \n\nShe didn't provide a straw for a tea, and there was another waitress near by. Not wanting to upset our waitress even more my brother's fiancee asked this other waitress for a straw. She looked at her also with an attitude, and she said: both of my hands are full, can't you see! \n\nFull disclosure: both of these waitresses were African American and my family is hispanic. I don't know if there's some sort of racial issue in New Orleans between these two races, but it just seemed that there was a lot of aggression for things that are pretty normal at a restaurant. \n\nWe said we wanted to leave and asked for the check and the manager. The manager came, and asked us what the situation was. Our waitress had these threatening eyes on us the entire time, and the manager asked her to step aside, at which point the waitress started raising her voice. We said to the manager: \"this attitude is precisely why we want to pay and leave now and handed her $20dlls without looking at the bill (but we had asked for 2 coffees, 1 tea, water, and 2 diet cokes, a lot less than $20). I was expecting for an apology and to let us go without pay since we had barely touched our drinks. However, she took our $20dlls. and left the table. All the while three people with long hair peaked from the kitchen staring us also in a very threatening way. It was actually very scary. When the manager picked up our $20dlls we didn't wait for the change and left the table. We were actually worried for a little bit about being followed by the guys staring at us from the kitchen, but it was all fine. We're just never going back. \n\nIt is a real shame, because I really like Ihop.",

He was unable to eat there until August 2014, at that time the manager informed him that the gift card, that was payed with $25 on a credit card, had expired and he could not use this.  According to the FTC: \"Money on a gift card cannot expire for at least five years from the date the card was purchased, or from the last date any additional money was loaded onto the card. If the expiration date listed on the card is earlier than these dates, the money can be transferred to a replacement card at no cost.\"  When we requested they honor the gift card the manager refused to do so. This is an illegal practice and I DO NOT recommend anyone ever purchase a gift card. I have submitted a claim to the BBB and hope that El Maguey decides to abide by the law and honor the money that we have already given them.",

Every time I've gone in there the employees are nothing but rude and not at all helpful. I went in there twice in one day and both of the interactions I had with the two different cashiers just left me appalled. The first time I went up and asked for ONE thing behind the counter and the cashier said \"what?\" So I asked nicely again and she still said \"what?\" And after asking her for the second time she then pulls out A headphone from her ear so I can ask a THIRD time. Then I had another encounter later that evening where the male cashier told me \"not to get smart with him\" when I simply asked a valid question about purchasing some ranch. There are just not any nice, personable people working in there. So if you stop here, I'd just get gas outside so you don't have to go in and talk to any of their shitty employees.",

I placed an order for a #1 meal which is their Big Mac. As I waited for 14 minutes to get my meal several other customers approached the counter  complaining about their order accuracy. I watched as several people had to repeat this process three or more times before getting their order right or they gave up in frustration. No staff member including the English speaking manager/supervisor ever apologized or acknowledged the customers exasperation it gave the assistance if caring at all. \n\nI figured with my long wait that I would at least get a hot fresh meal but apparently my food must have been praised long before my arrival. I received a cold Big Mac that was half unassembled in the box with my side of cold soft fries. Not sure why it took 20 minutes from the time I arrived at the counter until I received my order since the time was obviously not doesn't preparing my food and there were not many other customers in the store. \n\nLack of employee engagement, lack of empathy and poor or no management seemed to be the order of the day here. How on earth they can keep the doors open with every customer on site complaining and NO response or concern from staff is simply amazing.",

    "text": "This restaurant was the worst experience that I've had in Indianapolis to date. A coworker and I decided to go to lunch today at a Mexican restaurant that she recommend it. It was my first mind to go somewhere else but I decided to try something new and Yelp something different for a change. Mistake! \n\nUpon entering we saw the sign for the lunch special wish we were both excited about, hey $5.99! We sat down and the waitress seemed friendly. She showed us the lunch menu. I decided to get the taco special and 1 chicken tamale to try (im still seachung for great tamales). Of course like a few other places that I have been too lately, my waitress comes from the kitchen to announce no tamles are ready for today.  Interesting because it's noon and you don't have my ready but you opened at 11am... #ICant\n\nI let it go (and took off a star), getting ready for my  taco lunch with onions and cilantro extra cheese. It came out in due time  only to find out I was not very happy with the food at all. Actually took me a little while to eat my second taco. The positive thing about the meal was the portions. The two tacos were large. It just did not taste like authentic Mexican tacos. It tastes like something that I could easily make at home. American best-try kind-of tacos. Another star gone. \n\nWe ready to go soon enough and we ask for separate check which the waiter said that she could do. However she did not bring out separate checks. In fact my coworker had to ask how much her meal was. The waitress had to go back and count up for her total and then come back and tell her how much the her portion was. Well knowing that I only spent about $7 in the restaurant I did not think I needed to do the same. Mistake. I was very surprised when found out my meal was almost $11 when my card was ran. Apparently it was extra for the cilantro onion even know the meal came with tomatoes and lettuce which I asked for instead. Never was told it was extra. I knew I had to pay for extra chees, but dang!  Management came out upon my request to give me a breakdown of the bill, especially since I couldn't get itemized bill. I was not happy, not buying the explaination, nor impressed. They give me a small, change of a refund and vowed to NEVER be back. \n\nNo tamales, no detailed bill, no prior knowledge of changes would be extra, food not great at all... Yeah, you have ok decor and yes you smiled but service is lacking, never again. #EpicEpicEpicFail",

So, when we had guests in town, we decided to drive a bit and take them to Bottleworks on a nice fall day to enjoy a few drinks before dinner at our place. What in the heck happened to this place? Saturday afternoon, the patio was about 2/3 full, but we got a 30-45 minute wait for 15 people including a few babes. On top of that, we were told we had to order food if we sat on the patio. Fine, we will order a few appetizers. Nope, it had to be entrees. After promising to make it up to the server and tip well, we were given a pager. Waited 45 minutes to be seated as we watched tables sit empty. Once seated, some of our group ordered entrees because the server made them feel bad, so that made the meal I already had prepared completely worthless. The topper was when we got our checks, the server told us we were not as bad as she expected and to come back again when we got babysitters for the babies. So is there some new trend in hospitality to treat your guests like this that should make them want more? \nI do hold a special place in my heart for this place as we used to walk there with our kids all the time and even hit up their markets and other events, but I was so embarrassed for talking this place up the way I did and actually driving more than a mile to go here. Surely, Schlafly realizes that there is another great brewery right down the street that has a much better vibe and appreciation for their guests. Live and learn.",

They cook everything super slow and one at a time so half your meal is either going to be cold or you'll be full by the time you get the other half of your meal and the service is meh too!\nIf they didn't have the free birthday meal thing going for them, i'd have to say they'd be going out of business based on the quality of the food and service. Their prices are also insanely expensive compared to others i've been to.

No mussels or green tea ice cream were offered. I explained how crappy the food was to the sushi chef who made it and all he had to share was laughing.

When questioned about the automatic gratuity, owner sister stated \"all restaurants do this during Essence\"....I told her that's untrue, she disagreed. This means this establishment takes advantage of Essence visitors. \nThe male waiters could not provide decent service due to their lack of focus and flirting.

However Wetzle's tastes amazing so I give it a pass. \n\nBut this place takes the cake in terrible costing and tasting pretzels! I think I HAVE paid less for a pretzel at Disneyland! And probably have had dog food that was richer in taste. (Why am I eating dog food? None of your business! Maybe I just like to know what it tastes like so I can write accurate reviews about poor taste, ok?) \n\nOk so I bought this pretzel anyway because I had a BOGO coupon, but it so wasn't worth it. Even if the pretzel had been $1 I wouldn't return! This pretzel was stale, stiff and overly chewy like a steak that was a crappy piece of meat to begin with and then got over-cooked. It tastes like they made it no sooner than yesterday and it was thin, yet not that crispy. \n\nAbsolutely hated this pretzel and I can't believe I was suckered into such a travesty by a stupid coupon from Tmobile! That's right Tmobile, I'm bringing you into this too- please don't ever pair up with this place again!",

Ordered their baked meatballs appetizer last week ($9) and came home to find two small meatballs in the container---usually it comes with three nice sized ones.  I called the restaurant to see what happened and was told \"you only get two now.\"  Of course, they didn't lower the price.  Almost $5 PER MEATBALL???  Let's get serious.  I have emailed the manager twice and haven't heard back.  I also glanced at their Facebook page and not a single complaint posted by other customers was addressed either.   What a great way to lose customers.  We won't be back.",

    "text": "I was very dissatisfied with this place. I've been wanting to eat here for a long time but every time I tried, there was a line out the door. I thought to myself, \"wow it must be awesome!\" So I decided to grin and bear the wait to finally experience what I thought was gonna be awesome. The breakfast was extremely expensive for mediocre taste. I had a simple breakfast of 2 eggs, home fries, turkey sausage and 3 pancakes and I asked for a side of toast (the honey's platter) What I received was the smallest pancakes I've ever seen, 2 eggs, one small sausage, a bite of potatoes and my side of toast was one slice not even toasted. This platter cost me $13 THIRTEEN DOLLARS!?!? The taste was sub par I couldn't finish the sausage bc it was gross, the potatoes were greasy, the eggs were cooked well and so were the pancakes but 13 dollars for a standard breakfast is insane. My one slice of untoasted bread was another $2.50!!!! Don't get me wrong I'm all for spending a decent amount of money on a good meal but this was hardly that. My dining partner got the Christo which is essentially a ham and cheese sandwich and a small amount of greens on the side, which she enjoyed but was $14. All in all the check came to $42 after drinks and tip. I would never return to this place, I left feeling dissatisfied and let down and created a yelp account just to write this review. The only thing good about this place was the company and the service was on point (but I guess it should be when you're charging that much for breakfast items)  If you want a good meal that's worth your $ with top notch food this isn't the place and you should try Silk City!",

They were thin with burnt crust and room temperature. Worst of all they were $15-16 a pop! Insane. I could stay in the suburbs and go to a mom & pop joint where real unpretentious folks go and get a pizza ten-times as good for half the cost!\n\nPlastic chairs and little to no atmosphere. The service wasn't bad and that was the high point! I hate that places like this can actually be successful. A total half-assed effort catered to mindless hipsters and wannabes that think it's cool to do the Philly thing for a few years. Real Philly people know where to get Pizza and Vetri ain't it!",

Well, somehow although we paid for our slices our order was lost. Then when she immediately redid my order it was completely wrong, and they ran out of what my friend order. At this point we were hungry and cutting it close with time, that we just ate what we had to fill our stomachs and left. Prob will not be back.

    "text": "Went there for lunch before they moved locations and myself and husband were pretty impressed.  Just think about how excited we were to hear that they were now open for breakfast at their new location! \n\nWe visited there on a Sunday morning for breakfast.  Husband isn't home that much due to work so we wanted to enjoy a sit down breakfast together before running our errands for the day and thought we would try out the new breakfast menu (Belgian waffle with side of bacon for me and Disco Ball for my husband).  Walked in to no line at all and placed our order at the counter.  Went around to pay, grab our fruit tea, and took a seat.  We looked around and noticed what appeared to be a couple people (I'm assuming at this point) ordered food after their group did.  Didn't really think anything of it.  After approx. 20 mins, my name is called. They put my Belgian waffle down (no sign of side of bacon) and tell us that my husband's meal is right behind them.  My husband didn't want my food to get cold so told me to go ahead without him.  I ate my ENTIRE waffle and he still didn't have his food.  Plates were slowly making their way from the kitchen to the other people's tables. My husband still waiting for his.  I finally go to the counter and ask about his plate.  They hand me a plate that was sitting on the counter and says \"Breakfast takes longer to cook.\"  Ummmmmmmmm....ok..  They didn't seem apologetic in the slightest even though I told them that I've already finished my breakfast.  I took his plate to him and went back up for my side of bacon.  He literally finished his food before my side of bacon was brought to the table.  His food was cold and the look of the meat on his plate was questionable.  The quiche was pretty good though!\n\nNeedless to say, our planned nice sit down breakfast together turned out to be far from our expectations which included a price tag of $30.  If you go for breakfast and plan to eat TOGETHER...you may want to take a snack to eat while others in your party enjoy their plates one by one.",

    "text": "Where do I start?\n\nFirst, I was reminded of an old Seinfeld episode when my \"reservation\" for a specific room was not honored because the hotel was sold-out.  Never mind we paid for the room in advance.  And to top it off the young lady checking us in made me feel as if the hotel's lack of availability for the room type we reserved was my fault.  Candidly, I was too tired to argue with her as we had spent nine hours driving and I should have asked some questions so this is partly my fault - obviously the young lady at the front desk did a great job of making me feel like the was my fault.\n\nI will tell you this...Nick, the young man who helped us with our car and initial greeting outside was fantastic.  We had three experiences with him and he was amazingly helpful.  Perhaps Nick the Valet should be giving training to those in the front office and at the front desk relative to customer service.\n\nAs Jerry Seinfeld said, \"...you know how to take the reservation, you just don't know how to \"hold\" the reservation, and that's really the most important part of the reservation, the holding.\"",

This last time was my absolute final straw with this location. The woman behind me had order 5 drinks and had gotten all of them before me, as well as the 3 people behind me. When I asked if my order had made it through because the people behind me had gotten their orders, the man behind the counter said oh yes it is right here is is coming up. Well, 3 more orders later, again from people who order after me, I finally received my iced coffee. And it only took 20 minutes to get.

    "text": "This is a really bad establishment overall. We found the restaurant's decor impressive however this restaurant demonstrates really bad waiter service and probably acts of greed. It's a disgrace that this restaurant is serving as a living representation of Taiwanese culture.\n\nFirst of all, the food is decent enough considering that it is away from the Bay Area, which thusly does not introduces competitive Taiwanese restaurants. If this restaurant were in the Bay Area, the restaurant would be sure to go out of business. At the restaurant, we ordered Stinky Tofu and it was unbelievable when we were given only 8 pieces for 5 dollars. That equals to about roughly 60 cents per piece. That is ridiculous considering the dedication and size of these pieces. Besides from that, we decided that the food is reasonable enough although it was smaller portioned compared to the Bay Area Taiwanese restaurants. \n\nThe waiter service as mentioned previously is horrible. The waiters offered no expression of gratitude for keeping them in employment. In addition, as we left, the waiter offered no thanks and greedily halted his task on hand and searched visually our table for our tips. This is ridiculous. I understand that the all people want money. Or else why work? The problem is that he doesn't mask his temptations and greed of money and plainly expresses it.\n\nThe decor in the restaurant is one good aspect of the restaurant. I found the restaurant rather comfortable and the television was conveniently angled so then the customers do not need to turn their necks uncomfortably. I loved the painting of Taipei 101 on the wall as well. The kitchen was opened to us and from what I see, the kitchen looks pretty clean.\n\nThe thing that makes me angry at this establishment is the inclination of the waiters to whites opposed to non-whites. The waiter offered better services to our neighboring table of whites however, offered less then decent services to us non-whites. We found this consistent throughout the restaurant. Now, I honestly don't care what the reason of discrimination may be but this is beyond acceptable.",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I have been coming to this location almost everyday for a year. We order the same thing every time and normally they manage to get it right. In the last two weeks this location has gone drastically down hill! \n\nLast Sunday, I waited in the drive thru line for what seemed like forever. Once I got up to the speaker I placed my order and was given my Total. When I finally made it to the Window, they asked what I ordered and told me that it looked like my order hadn't been entered. I gave them my order two more times then paid. When I was handed my Medium Iced Coffee (black) and Medium Iced Coffee with Milk and Carmel Swirl, it was very clear one of the drinks was incorrect. When I mentioned this to the girl in the window she proceeded to raise her voice at me and tell me the drink was in fact what I ordered. The Manager finally comes to the window to see what was happening. I calmly told him that I ordered a Medium Iced Coffee with Milk and Carmel Swirl and the drink I received was incorrect. The girl in the window began yelling that I had ordered an Iced Carmel Mocha. The Manager did remake my drink, but neither him or the girl in window apologized for yelling at me and telling me I didn't know what I ordered.\n\nNot ready to give up on this place, I went back this morning to get the same two drinks. Again they handed us a Carmel Mocha, and argued with my boyfriend when he said the drink was incorrect. He tried the drink that their request and when he insisted it was incorrect they continued to say it was in fact what he ordered. We eventually left with the incorrect drink because we were tired of arguing and needed to get to work.\n\nThis location needs to get it's act together and learn some Customer Service or it will permanently lose our business.",

This restaurant is doomed. The waiter was nice but everything took a ridiculously long time to receive. My friend ordered a French Onion Soup and it came in a coffee cup sized portion and apparently was bland. My other friend and I got salads that were unmentionably average. Then it took literally over 30 min to receive our entrees. My first friend ordered the veal chop and it was actually good. My other friend ordered the salmon and it was ok and appropriately prepared. I ordered the roasted chicken after bragging to the waiter that I am a roasted chicken connoisseur and he highly recommended their roasted chicken. I am not exaggerating when I tell you it was smaller than my fist (I am a petite woman). The drum stick portion was smaller than my pinky finger. It was actually very cute but ridiculous for $28. It was over cooked, dry and basically I got about 3 bites of actual chicken. We had to complain because I thought it was a joke. The waiter explained that these chickens are 28 days old when they are cooked. So they are basically baby chickens. If they gave two in a portion I could have understood the cost. When we complained, they offered another one to eat. It took at least 15 more minutes to receive this one and the waiter offered to wrap it up because it was obvious we were ready to get the heck out of there. We talked to the manager and he had no interest in our story. I'm mostly just sad that this restaurant was so bad and will likely not survive.",

    "text": "After a long day last Sunday trudging through the woods to clean and clear trail myself and two other friends decided to go out for dinner.  We stopped at the Pic-A-Lilli on Rt. 206 and it was packed shoulder to shoulder.  So we decided to go to La Campagnola instead, just before five o'clock.  It was really kind of empty at that time.  I read on the bill board outside that they offer an early bird special until 5:30.  We sat at the bar and the tall skinny young bartender, that plays college volleyball and looks like Clarke Kent (I don't know his name) hands us menu's.  I had to ask for the Early Bird Menu, it wasn't automatic.  I ordered the Fettuccine Campagnola which was a white cream sauce with peas and small cubes of prosciutto, it also came with, \"soup, salad and my choice of two desserts.\"  I ordered the seafood bisque for my soup and wanted a house salad and a cannoli for my dessert.  The bartender says, \"it is soup OR salad\" and i explained that there was a comma in between the words 'soup, salad' and not and 'OR'!  I told him i wanted soup AND salad.  Remember I walked through the woods so at that point in the day I was starving!  I ordered a beer while i was waiting and the soup came out.  It was just ok...nothing too great, no real hunks of seafood.  Then I expected for my salad to come out and instead the pasta dish comes out....so I ask, \"where is my salad?\" and the bartender responds AGAIN, \"it is soup OR salad\" as if i am mentally disabled.  I said, \"yes, i know, but i wanted salad too.\"  He said, \"Oh, ok.  I can go get that right now.\" as my pasta dish was sitting there getting cold.  I told him forget about it at this point my entree is here already.  Apparently it was the end of his shift and he was more concerned about cashing his drawer out than waiting on us.  Then he was a douche on top of that explaining that it was 'OR' even though the friggin menu had a comma which indicates AND!!  All the while making me out to be some kind of retard.  Anyway, having a father that is an Executive Chef from Italy and growing up in the restaurant business, I know that THE CUSTOMER IS ALWAYS RIGHT!  I won't be going to that dump anymore!  Eff that place...they should hire people that aren't kids and people that know how to type a specials menu!",

    "text": "Terrible customer service!  Nice, beautiful Sunday afternoon, we wanted to sit outside, have a drink and eat a late lunch.  The hostess took us to our table which was in the sun (all the other tables were under the pavilion in the shade) and there was a table with young kids right next to this table.  We wanted a nice quiet lunch to ourselves since it was a day without kids for us. We asked to sit on the other side where it was quieter and it was in the shade.  We were told we could not sit there because there was no server there.  I asked if the server could maybe walk two tables over she said no.  We went inside and asked for a manager and we were directed to the same hostess yet again and was told they didn't know who the manager would be that we need to talk to.  We were so excited when we walked up because it was the perfect atmosphere on the perfect day to be outside.  Needless to say we did not stay and will never go back.",

We gave our name at least a half dozen times and kept being told we would be seated in just a few minutes. People with later reservations and even walk-ins were being seated before us so we left.\nWe've been here before and love the food so it's a shame that this happened.\nThe two hostesses at the front were not doing anything and just ignored the costumers, even those coming in for pickups.",

Showed up to the restaurant and they claimed that they do not take reservations, only call ahead seating. They did not try to accommodate us in any way for their screw up. My family and I took our business to landmark across the street who was happy to help us.",

    "text": "I've never felt the need to write a review until now... Was super excited to try this place with some coworkers one day last week. Arrived just after noon. There were 4 other tables and then us. It took 15 min to be offered anything besides water. We said we were n a bit of a hurry and would like to order. 10 min later he came back so we actually could... Another 25 min later when we were still without food ( salads and a flatbread and simple sandwich) we asked that our food be packaged to go.  Sadly the poor service (empty water bottle, forgotten ice tea) didn't stop there. The salads were not the ones we ordered and we were missing a sandwich! Looks cool on paper and at the actual location but I would recommend this place to an enemy. The food and service were sad.",

Aside from the mediocre taste, small portion size, and unreasonably high price of my entree,  the fact that it gave me food poisoning really nailed it home.  On the plus side, nobody else at my table endured food poisoning from their entrees (omelets and juevos rancheros) and the wait staff was pleasant.",

The scallop appetizer was cooked well. Roasted vegetables were overpriced at $10. Shrimp crostini was flavorless and didn't seem fresh. Meatballs were nothing to write home to mom about. Service was fine but we won't be back.",
