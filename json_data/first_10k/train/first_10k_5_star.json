When we came in the line was very long but surprisingly we were sat in about 15-20 minutes. The service was fast from start to finish so I didn't have to wait long before I could start eating the juicy amazing chicken. I was planning on getting an order to go to drive back to Virginia to eat but that seemed greedy so I didn't. I regretted that decision the second I got back home so next time, I will be greedy!",

Am amazing place for sushi in the city. We were there for what they were calling their soft opening, where apparently they are testing out menu and cocktail items for their \"official\" opening sometime soon. We were very pleased with the ambiance, service and food/drink. The fish is top quality. We said hello to the owner/executive chef and he seemed to be beaming over his accomplishments, rightfully so! This is a must stop if you're a sushi/Asian fusion fan. We look forward to seeing what's in store for Tuna Bar and are thrilled to have this a two minute walk away!",

I had the Dolmades, and my coworker, the combo plate which had moussaka and dolmas and lamb (which he could not stop raving about). To our surprise our server brought dessert on the house, since we had never dined there before, it was such a nice touch! Ben our server was fantastic and knowledgable. We are both in the industry so we felt guilty about staying until the restaurant closed, but we were just so comfortable and well fed that we lost track of time. Spiro's is very close to my house, it will definitely be my new regular spot. Thank you Ben, and the whole Spiro's crew, for a great time to compliment a rare night off! You rock!",

Service is great, venue is quintessential French Quarter. It's a little distracting to see ghost tours outside the window at dinner- but the food is so delicious, you won't mind the audience.

Debatable.\n\nAnimo started with juice.  Not frozen juices with sorbet & yogurt added.  Real juice.  \n\nTheir menu has expanded & they now call themselves \"Animo Juice & Burrito Bar!\"  The burrito menu features 10 burritos, all under $10, f my favorite the \"Haight & Ashbury\" is stuffed with rice, beans, meat/roasted veggies, cheese, lettuce, tomato, guacamole & sour cream.\n\nNot that hungry, have a 'petito', a small version of the burrito, averaging $5.  Porky & Petunia - the name is as cute as the petito is yummy:  shredded lettuce, pulled pork & pineapple salsa.  \n\nA breakfast petito & Animo MD juice destroy any hangover.  The MD is juiced greens, carrot, orange, apple, kiwi, banana & spirolina.   My BF loves the Chilly Palmer:  Acai, apple, banana, yogurt & flax seed.  \n\nFor a happy belly add or substitute the perfectly cooked quinoa to any dish.  The Border Salad is a perfect example: lettuce, guac, pico de gallo, cheese, tortilla chips, cilantro lime vin, & sub quinoa for meat.   \n\nFiber-full signature juices, frozen whipped bananas, sliced fresh wheat grass (cheaper than Jameson!) & yogurt/granola bowls!  \n\nThe city's juice bars have something to learn from Animo.",

Just make sure your service number is visible I got distracted hid my number, and had to stop the guy looking.  \n\nService varies. Since its a busy sidewalk, people stop in for that pick me up before work or party.

The service was wonderful, the ambiance is cozy but alive. Make sure to call ahead and get a reservation over the phone if opentable looks booked. Their lunch special spicy fried chicken is a must have! If you are a party of two or three, ask for the corner booth by the window. Best table in the house.",

It has a cool hipster vibe, without being annoying :)  The burgers are outstanding, and there are endless options, whether you prefer beef, chicken, seafood, or veggie!  I would recommend the Woodstock - the Jack Daniels Maple Ketchup is out of this world, and Benton's bacon is always delicious.  Upgrade to the truffle fries; they're to die for.  Or, if you're a vegetarian, the troyathalon is a great option.  Filling, with great texture and flavor.  As far as drinks go, 12 South Lemonade.\n\nThe customer service is also great.  They've always been attentive, but not \"on top of you\", and they're very knowledgable about their food.  Parking can be a bit difficult at certain times of the day, but it's worth a short walk if necessary.\n\nI would definitely recommend checking it out!",

    "text": "Great Mexican BYOB! I went to Las Cazuelas for the first time for my birthday.  We had a wonderful time.  I was looking for a fun and festive place to go with friends.  This was the perfect choice. We brought our own bottle of tequila, and they made tasty margaritas for the table.  Those were a big hit with my friends, and a cool twist for a Mexican BYOB.  The restaurant is cute.  Plus, the food here is delicious. \n\nI'm surprised this place doesn't have higher reviews on Yelp, because it far exceeded my expectations... \n\nThe guacamole appetizer was fresh and yummy.  I ordered the shrimp entree with rice and vegetables, and asked for it spicy.  My entr\u00e9e had an attractive presentation on the plate (i.e. looked classy), and was delicious, well seasoned, and very fresh. On my suggestion, my partner ordered one of their mole sauce dishes (i.e. a sauce usually made from unsweetened chocolate and pureed pumpkin seeds), and it was tasty too. \n\nI should also note that the waitress was very attentive.  When I placed my order, I explained to her that I have mild lactose intolerance and can't eat much butter or cream (but am okay with cheese), so she had the chef cook the veggies in olive oil, rather than butter.  Thanks for being so cool about accommodating that request!  \n\nThe prices are extremely reasonable for fancy and unusual Mexican food, and I love the fact they're a BYOB.  The chef serves creative and inspired cuisine, which has a traditional flair and style to it.  In other words: Don't come here for regular tacos or burritos.  Come here for a fun foodie experience at a reasonable price, and bring tequila for the perk of BYOB Margaritas!",

    "text": "This shop is a slice of Disney beauty and magic hiding on the edge of Broad Ripple, and a MUST stop of sweets, treats, and dreaminess. Your Instagram needs this place. Hands down the ~best~ red velvet cake of my life.\n\nAppearance: The Cake Bake Shop is a beautifully decorated, small white house with a captivating design. The flowers around the sign make it an #instaworthy post for sure, and when the weather is nice, the outdoor seating must be gorgeous.\n\nInside the Cake Shop will take your breath away, light airy colors and flowers and twinkling lights. This isn't the kind of cake shop you do take-out at, you'll want to sit and enjoy. \n\nFood: I wanted to try the Raspberry Champagne cake, unfortunately one wouldn't be ready for a little while, so I ordered a slice of the Red Velvet  Cake. The floral icing work was so perfect I didn't want to touch it, but I had to because come on it's cake. What I assume must have been cream cheese filling in the middle was decadent and I never wanted the cake to end. ***I felt one slice was plenty for two people, it's HUGE\n\nI was torn between the Rose Cappuccino and the Lavender Latte. I went with the Lavender Latte, hot, and it was stunning, it was a creamy, smooth, not-at-all bitter latte and the hint of lavender was enough to taste but not over powering, it was probably the most perfect coffee I've ever had in my life. \n\nPrice: the coffee is pricy, $6, so not a regular coffee stop for me, but for #treatyoself it's the way to go. The slice of cake was $12 but like I mentioned, it was enough for two people and for how amazing it was, I think it's so worth it.\n\nCustomer Service: I mentioned Disney initially because the friendliness, care, and attention of the staff felt just like Disney. They were kind, they helped me decide what to try, and the barista even offered to make me the rose cappuccino if I didn't like the lavender latte after trying it - how sweet! \n\nI will most definitely think to come here if anyone visits and wants something sweet. This place has my heart and is a hidden gem to anyone who has a sweet tooth!\n\nCheck out my #FirstTimeFriday highlight of my visit to The Cake Bake Shop on my Instagram @jordanqjordanq for pictures of everything mentioned above!",

There's a wrap-around balcony where you can get a great view of Jackson Square. \n\nIf you're curious, learn why Muriel's is haunted and find out the story behind why there's a table that is always set for two located near the stairs. \n\nThere are two main dining rooms, a middle section (indoor patio dining area) that I personally prefer because it is quieter, and a bar area located at the back near the restrooms. I love the indoor patio dining area because it brings a bit of the outdoors in a quiet indoor setting. \n\nOn my first visit, I ordered from the dinner pre-fix menu which is a great deal (appetizer or soup + entr\u00e9e + dessert = $40). The seafood gumbo soup was hearty and delicious. The dijon mustard encrusted salmon was cooked perfectly. The bread pudding was a great way to end a delicious meal.\n\nI returned to Muriel's for lunch on another NOLA trip and tried the wood grilled pork chop. The pork chop was flavorful, tender, and moist. I was not too crazy about the red beans and rice it was served with as I found it a bit bland. The entr\u00e9e was served in a bowl but should perhaps be served on a plate since it was difficult to slice the pork chop since it kept sinking into the bed of red beans and rice. \n\nMuriel's is one of the places I would love to return to because of the ambiance and the great food.",

The biscuit was light and flakey and the rice was absolutely delicious. For sure this is going to be a regular stop when in NOLA.\n\nP.S.  in the excitement, I forgot to grab my wallet when leaving my hotel room and didn't realize it until I was placing my order. Rather than send me on my way, the manager on duty told me to just bring the money tomorrow! I truly appreciate the gesture and find it refreshing that small business owners place this level of trust in their clientele. Thank you Julie!",

If you get there on the earlier side you may be able to grab some of their delicious baked eggs or oatmeal.  I actually worked at companion back in 2001... What a change it has gone through, but the food is still just as yummy.  \n\nMy salad rotation goes between the Picnic Basket and the Go Green... But all of the salads are a good sized portion with lots of goodness in them.  You can't go wrong with any of the salads.  The sandwiches are all also great - my husband loves the Frenchie, I love the Mermaid or the regular chicken salad sandwich or the Fa La La... YUM, the breads are all made in house.\n\nI will always love Companion and go for lunch a lot - it's basically every week at this point.",

There is a wide variety of drink selections, and the cinnamon and caramel apple cider drinks are wonderful additions to the fall menu \n\nStarters: The New Orleans BBQ shrimp is quite tasty but by far my favorite thing to do is order the pomme frites with garlic mayo. These little guys are like crack, and even people who hate mayo seem to love the dipping sauce \n\nEntrees: The curried chicken salad is fantastic, though I wish they would consider serving it on different bread (it comes on two mini sandwich rolls). The BLT is also a good choice (the addition of avocado and chipotle sauce is pretty ingenious), and the club sandwich is humongous and satisfying. \n\nDessert: I don't even know where to start. The Brown Shugga pie is stupid good. It never would have occurred me to order it because I don't sit around thinking about brown sugar, but a friend of mine did and I ate almost the whole thing. It's ooey, gooey, rich and delicious. The key lime pie is also a spectacular pick, as is the apple crisp. I've had almost every dessert on the menu, and not one of them has been a disappointment. The carrot cake might be one of the biggest slabs you can get in the entire United States... and it is so worth every last calorie.",

(Yes, You...Florida/Caribbean Spiny Lobster or perhaps shall I just call you a Giant Crayfish!?!) I have been a repeat and loyal customer at Lobster Haven for almost 2 years running now, since my office is just down the road. Lucky Me! I am always at my happiest when I know I can rely on an Authentic New England Seafood Market/Shanty near me. Oh and did I mention Affordable?!?!\n\nI can't think of a visit where the Lobster Haven staff has not been helpful in assisting me in plucking out my Lobsters from one of their many tanks along with their fresh Ipswich Steamer Clams just chillin' in their very own cozy tanks. They'll steam them up for you right there should you choose, bring them home or relax at one of the few tables within this Lobster Shack or in their newer room to accommodate a larger party.\n\nAmong the traditional New England staples such as Ipswich Clams, Maine Lobster, Sea Scallops, Cod, Haddock &/or freshly made Clam Chowder, etc... They carry a ridiculous variety of other fresh and frozen Seafood from our Gulf Coast Region, i.e.; Spiny Lobster Tails, Key West Pink Shrimp, Royal Red Shrimp, Grouper, Snapper, Redfish, Mahi Mahi, Jumbo Prawns, etc... I also count on them during Crawfish season when I have a frequent craving for Spicy Louisiana Crawfish...And..Well.. Once again, they do not disappoint there either! $5.99 per lb last time I picked some up. (FYI - Just 1 week ago)\n\nThis place is a MUST for all seafood lovers and for those seeking a taste of New England, I'll just say how very grateful I am to have this establishment in town - much more convenient then having fly up north every time I desire a taste of Boston!",

    "text": "One of my favorite places in town. This is a hole in the wall and not a place that you come to sit and enjoy your meal. It's really best to take it away, because the dining area is usually a little dirty.\nFamily-owned and -run, there always seem to be the same people (and, sometimes, their kids) behind the counter.\nI mainly come for the tamales, tortillas (voted Best of Tucson for a couple of years, and they include one with most combo meals) and flautas. Man, those flautas... They also have what I think is some of the best salsa in the city. Not too spicy, well-balanced, nice color, good consistency... like a fine wine. I'll usually save their salsa cups for use with other Mexican food that I get later.\nIf you like fake cheese nachos, then this is your place. But do yourself a favor and tell them to hold the onions because, otherwise, you'll find one has exploded in your container and it will take you two days to get the taste out of your mouth.\nThe best part about this place though is the price: cheap, cheap, cheap! Most of the combos run about $5 and include an entree, rice, beans, one tortilla and a couple of salsa cups. I usually make myself a little bean & rice burro when I'm done with the meal. Good stuff!\nI'll only recommend this to some people, if I know that they won't be offended by what a sh*thole this place is. No, honestly, it's a really crappy building. But, if you can get past that, then you'll find the food to be great.",

Loads of fresh lime and mint and just sweet enough!   \n\nDo not miss the starters here!  We had the shrimp corn dogs, bacon wrapped apricots and duck confit almonds.   The shrimp corn dogs are so good, and at only $2 each a really amazing deal!  The bacon wrapped apricots are an absolute must if you like the sweet-salty combo, and the almonds, which are roasted in duck fat, are absolutely delicious!  \n\nMy entree featured trout and a variety of delicious accompaniments including bacon spaetzle.  Everything is presented beautifully; do not expect that an entree will stuff you here or that the accompaniments are full \"side\" portions.  The flavors of everything together on the plate are just amazing and this trout entree was no exception!  We did get a side of the fried brussel sprouts which are not to be missed!!  \n\nThe desserts are all deconstructed, and again, the presentation is beautiful!   I had a smores dessert that included chocolate ganache, toasted marshmallow ice cream and graham cake squares.  \n\nService was excellent; attentive without being intrusive.  Courses were timed beautifully; we did not feel we were being rushed through, but also never felt we were left waiting.   \n\nThis is definitely a special occasion type place, but for such events, well worth the price!",

Not so long that I get impatient, but a tiny bit longer than a standard restaurant.

The server was not as attentive as I would have liked and I had to ask for water several times. But the hostess/manager was very friendly and chatted with us for a bit. The pace of the meal was perfect long enough to digest and enjoy between courses.  The setting is beautiful it feels very retro with the old fans, tin roofs, and dark wood. The boudin noir was delicious. Followed by crawfish bisque with stuffed crawfish which taste perfectly seafoody with a hint of spices very subtle layered flavors. The Gumbo was also very good. I had beef short rib were tender but the presentation was a bit weak. The other meals were more of visual masterpieces. The crabmeat omelet was delicious and the home made fries were perfect.

The prices are a bit high, but most items are imported or hard to find, so it's kind of understandable. I think we drooled over the bakery section for about 20 minutes -- everything looked AMAZING! nice place to find unusual ingredients, and really fresh meat and seafood.",

Their menu is 90% sushi and the other 10% is miso soup, gyzoa and various salads, no bento boxes, udon, donburi etc. Place is old and out dated but didnt bother me because it reminded me of most jap restaurants at home, my partner however noticed a unusual scent and the fact that they needed to renovate the place a little. We had the gyoza has a starter and it was delicious! My partner had the California, rock & roll and crunch shrimp roll. \nI had spicy tuna(raw), spicy crab and crab with fried shrimp roll. I was reluctant to try the more tradtional sushi or nigiri as i have been let down so so so many times so i decided to order rolls that i wouldnt regret so much later on lol \n Everything was amazing!! Couldnt believe how great every roll tasted. My fave was the spicy tuna roll, it was fresh and how it should be made. Our waiter was nice and attentive. I am done searching, this is now my go to place for sushi. Cant wait to try the rest of the menu! Together with a green tea & sprite our bill came to $44 just another reason to return!!!!",

Everything I have ever had has been really good, especially their grilled reuben.  When the weather is nice, you can go out on the patio which is nice because I'm an occasional smoker.  There's a bar out there and they even have a huge tv they roll out.  When it starts to get chilly, they fire up the portable propane heaters.

We started with an Ashak appetizer, an incredible lightly steamed dumpling covered with a meat, yogurt sauce.  Also tried The Bulani appetizer. It was a crunchy fried potato and onion pastry with a yogurt dip. It's a BYOB, so we brought a decent bottle of champagne and saved a lot on the bill. I ordered the Qablee Palaw which was tender marinated lamb with almonds, raisins, carrots, and rice. My wife had the lamb kabob, grilled, smoky and very tender. We finished the meal with afghan style ice cream, and baklava with two strong coffees. Perhaps the best and most affordable meal we've had in town in the last several years.",

The menu had items I rarely saw else where and the food was great taste wise as well. They even accommodated a special request for a meat selection not listed for an item. The tri leches dessert was one of the best I have had like that and they had a slightly different way of doing it. \n\nI would recommend this place!",

    "text": "This is my very first review.  I figured reviewing Village Whiskey would kick me off to a good start.  \n\nMy wife and I arrived at 8:00pm and was told there was a 2 hour wait.  I read reviews prior to arriving so I was prepared to wait.  I was still a little surprised at how small this place is.  We decided to wait around by the bar.  After waiting for roughly 25 minutes, a spot opened up at a sit down counter, adjacent to the bar.  \n\nFor starters, we ordered the pickled red and golden beets along with turnips and black kale from their pickled section.  We liked the pickled beets but the turnips and black kale surprisingly where our favorite.  The acidity was mild and the black kale was crisp.  The toppings I ordered on my burger were Rogue Smokey Bleu, caramelized onions, bacon, and a fried egg.  I had high expectations for my burger and I was not disappointed.  It was cooked to perfection.  I wish I knew what grinds of meet they used to create their burgers because they had the right amount of fat to keep them moist and where full of flavor.  I was underwhelmed with the duck fat French fries.  They were okay, but nothing exceptional to me. The S'more milk shake was excellent!  The homemade marshmallow had all the characteristics and nuances of their camp fire cousins.  \n\nI woke up the next day, thinking about the burger I consumed the night before at the Village Whiskey.  Hands down, this is ONE of the best burgers I have eaten!",

    "text": "My family decided to take my mom out to dinner for her birthday and we wanted to try out a new place. Having heard a lot of good things about Limoncello we thought we'd give it a shot. I'm so glad we did, because this place rocks!\nI haven't eaten at an Italian restaurant this good in a long time. The food was outstanding. My family is big eaters, and we did WORK! Let's start with the appetizers. I had the Calamari Fritti, which was amazing. I am a big fan of dipping sauces and loved that it came with three! I tried some of the others which were the Ariancini, clams, and mussels. All of which were equally good, especially the mussels. Next we split up a chicken ala vodka pizza. It was crisp and tasty. I got a chicken tortellini soup next. It was great and I loved that the tortellini was al dente, and not the mush commonly found in soup. Finally I got my entree, the Pescatore, which considered of a mix of seafood over linguine. I chose the white wine sauce, and it was delicious. Oh, and how could I forget, the complimentary bruschetta and limoncello was the perfect beginning and end to our meal.\nI can't write this review and not mention how phenomenal the service was. We had an 8:15 reservation and were greeted by the hostess and told our table would be a few minutes. She was very kind. While we were waiting the manager came up to us, offered us drinks, and told us the next available table was ours. It was nice knowing that they cared we were waiting. After a few minutes we were seated. Our waiter was GREAT. He was very professional, told us about the specials, didn't need to write anything down, and kept our drinks full the whole meal. What more could you ask for in a waiter?\nBottom Iine here folks, if you want great italian cuisine and great service, then check out Limoncello!",

As someone who eats meat, I had doubts about trying it initially since it's a 100% vegetarian but I was pleasantly surprised and now I'm hooked! \n\nI love the feel of this place -- it's very charming. It's pretty small so I recommend that you make a reservation especially if you plan to go on a Friday or Saturday evening. Please also note that it's BYOB and the dessert menu changes occasionally. \n\nThe adobo goat cheese nachos are a must try! I also recommend the black bean soup, the mediterranean sampler, the blue corn asparagus tacos, and the falafel wrap. \n\nThe only dish which I'm not fond of is the wild mushroom risotto.",

A How-To kit for duplicating their famous macaroons. All the gadgets one would need to bake a masterpiece are in this delicious little side venture. They even have a wall stocked with jams, honeys, caramels, chocolates, nuts, salts, sugars and other high end, super must have ingredients to wow your taste buds (and show off to your dinner guests!)

I also added to my insane cookie-cutter collection, which I hide from my other half so he doesn't think I'm Kitchen Cuckoo! Oh, wait... I think he's on to me ;)\n\nThis is definitely a must visit store if you are a culinary wizard, or just like to wing-it!

    "text": "I found myself in The Big Easy for a convention back in the beginning of May. I stayed about 1.5 miles from the Convention center thinking a morning walk with a breakfast stop would be good for me. I went online and looked at reviews and picked a few spots along my route that I felt would be worthy of checking out for breakfast. As I was strolling along Magazine Street I peaked in the window of what I thought was a Pastry/Cake/Sweets stuff kind of place. \"BITTERSWEET confections\" For a moment I thought maybe they weren't open yet because it wasn't crowded with a line out the door like others I had passed.  Then I glanced over at the menu and I spotted the breakfast menu!!  I said to myself, give it a try, why wait in a line for 30 min elsewhere, you're right HERE dude. So I walked in and that is when my 3 day RELATIONSHIP started!.  Yep, it was so damn good I went back every day on my morning walk to the convention. Day one I asked to speak to the chef, a lovely lady FULL of passion about her food and family recipes. She makes a damn good Biscuit!! I wanted to apologize for not being able to finish my meal (Healthy Portions) and I didn't want anyone to think I was dissatisfied. She smiled, thanked me and said I'll see you tomorrow and tomorrow she did along with the day after. I could only finish half of my meal so on the remainder of my walk to the convention the next day I would find someone along the way who hadn't eaten yet and pass on the deliciousness of the day! It was a wonderful experience.  On my final day my local friend wanted to take me out for breakfast at one of \"THE SPOTS\", the convention was over and I wasn't on any schedule. We walked to the place she recommended (a very popular spot, with a very long line and wait). I said, I can't do this long line, let me show you a spot I found! So we took a nice morning stroll over to Bittersweet. BOOM!, another AMAZING meal, there was also a young couple that had come in for a tasting to pick out wedding cakes. I overheard them say they were on a budget with a humble look in their eyes. I can tell you from my seat they were treated like a respected customer who had deep pockets. I was thinking to myself if that cake tastes anything like the breakfasts I've been having these kids are in for a real TREAT!! Apologies for taking soooo long to sit down and post a review.  5 stars!!",

The donuts were moist and warm and extremely tasty and were probably the best I have ever had. The chicken was tender and moist and also delicious.\nThe only downside to this place is the size. The restaurant is very small and there is very little seating. The seating is diner style, stools at a counter.

Stopped by after working up an appetite running errands in town and we happened to show up during happy hour - two for one drinks (possibly also applies to alcoholic drinks, but we both got boba teas instead)\n\nThe scallion pancakes were a perfect appetizer. They came out hot, crispy, and a little oily, delicious.\n\nThe tonkatsu chicken and fried tofu bao were both delicious. All the condiments on their bao make for a sort of savory, sort of sweet flavor combo (cilantro, sweet sauce, and a few other things I don't remember off the top of my head)\n\nThe popcorn chicken was also excellent. Tiny, very crispy bits of chicken served with rice and a potato salad. I didn't try the potato salad, but heard it was more of a macaroni salad. \n\nI highly recommend Taiwan 101.

I don't the know owners name but he is the nicest guy. Very friendly. The food was delicious but it might have been wise for us to confirm what we thought we were ordering. Indian food is delicious but I am horrible at remembering what I ordered before. Unfortunately this review is another victim of my not being able to remember the names of what we ordered. One dish was mostly spinach (a total hit), another was some red chicken dish (perfectly cooked but looked like it was dyed red), and naan which is everyone's favorite. If you know your Indian dishes you won't be disappointed. Kids are always welcome there. Be sure to enjoy downtown while you're there.",

I popped in shortly before the place was going to close for the day, but that didn't matter - the employees were beyond friendly and helpful.  After some discussion, I decided to go with some pork chops, which had to be cut.  No problem, the staff was willing to cut the chops to the thickness of my liking.  And man, were they some of the best pork chops we've ever had.\n\nI had such a great experience that I went back 2 days later, this time with my husband, a lover of all things meaty.  We were again greeted and helped by the exceptional staff.  The experience you will have at Cappuccio's is worth the trip alone, but their meats are also exceptional.  I think we've found our local butcher shop.",

We'd been wanting to try out new restaurants, this one included, so the added discount gave us that extra push. Everything about our experience was great. We were seated immediately and our waiter came by shortly after. He gave great recommendations on the wine and the specials. I ordered the pasta dish of the day, which was so fabulous. He had  the Bouillabaisse which was also delicious. We were too full for dessert but the ones we saw being carried to other tables looked amazing! Our server was very attentive but not overbearing. The atmosphere was lovely--intimate but still had the feeling of being in a public place, which we like. It was a great experience.",

First- the people who own it and work there daily are always incredibly nice and polite.  The food is great, meat is tender and veggies are very fresh and the shrimp are decent size. Portions are a good value .  The menu is a little more limited than a more upscale fine dining Chinese place but better than most fast food Chinese places.   Sometimes they do offer specials that aren't on the regular menu.   An extra nice feature is if I'm too lazy to leave the house, that they deliver!   Anyway, like I said above, I can't say enough good things about this restaurant and the folks who run it.",

She's pretty picky about it of course, she's been used to the main 3 places up there that do it a little differently. Of course I was excited anyways because I'd never had Chicago style pizza before.\n\nAfter all the worriedness that she had, she was extremely happy with both the pizza and the awesome vintagey atmosphere. The waitress was very friendly as well. The self-serve beer cooler had a pretty good selection of craft beer, though I would have loved to see more of my favorites there. Also, the greek salad was easily one of the best I'd ever had in my entire life. It was pretty epic.\n\nOverall, we had an awesome experience, and will absolutely be going back again in the near future.",

    "text": "nice place to drop by at if your passing by on the road or making reservations for Habachi. first time there and they gave I and my wife free desert and honored the free California roll for checking in through the yelp app can you say awesome... staff is nice they seem to try to get to know the regulars that go there which is another plus AMAZING CUSTOMER SERVICE! so ait back relax and enjoy your sushi or meal. the parking was also reasonable. great they also do delivery and pick up so if you want to stay home call and place an order for their delicious California roll and eel avocado roll I found to be at a Fair price from the cooked roll part of the menu, and the special rolls e.g Dragon roll etc also reasonable and plenty. just be careful when you break apart your chop sticks if too much force used may fly near another customer around you which space for sushi section of the restaurant is pretty close when you sitting behind one another. fast service too due to the plenty servers available. for the wasabi if it's your first time eating the small amount of green paste wasabi be light with it it is over powering and burns your through and nostrils.  oh and the light was dim for all the lovers out there.",

I can't say much that put its in a different class then the other local stake houses though.\n\nOne thing to note is their 'happy hours'.  I've had several meetings at the bar during that time (5:00 to 6:30?) where the drinks are $6 and so are their 'Bar Bites' menu.  They have mini crab cake, burger and stake sandwiches - three of each for $6.  The burger and stake sandwiches are rib-eye I believe and really good.  They also have $2 oysters.\n\nAll in all - You can get a $195 shot of Lewi and a $175 porterhouse or a decent $6 sandwich and all with the same great service.\n\n**Please do the rest of us a favor and don't bring your kids here.  Thank you!**",

I also unfortunately have a broken cap on my front tooth ( ugh) so I had to order something that was soft and good for a tooth problem. The flavors screamed old world Italian and kids/adults were very happy with their meals. I had a pesto sauce on a long thin noodle - cooked to perfection. There was chicken parm at the table and it was not overly fried- very tender and flavorful.  This is A+.",

Some of the best, if not THE BEST mexican food I've ever had, and I've had a lot of mexican food. \n\nFirst off, the service was very polite and helpful, recommending some excellent dishes.  I had the tortilla soup, which had everything under the sun: tortilla strips, avocado chunks, sour cream, cheese globs, other good stuff that I don't even know about.  My brother got the cheese soup, which was really good also.\n\nI also had a shrimp quesadilla, which was really delicious, due to the spices they put on the shrimp,  nice blend of pepper and other unknown spices.  But the cous de gras, was the chiles, stuffed with shrimp, wrapped in bacon, and sitting in a soy sauce-esque liquid.  UNBELIEVABLE! I have no idea what it was called, but it's an appetizer, just ask the server.\n\nI would go far out of my way to make a trip back to El Merendero, I suggest you do the same.",

    "text": "This is the best place we have ever ordered sushi from. We refer so many people to this restaurant because we know they are always consistent. The food is always fresh and delicious. The hibachi is also fantastic and fun. Way more than enough food. The scallops are phenomenal too. We have had a lot of different sushi rolls here and all of them are fantastic. You can't wrong. The fried rice is awesome. You can't go to this restaurant without eating the fried rice or you will miss out. Our meals range from $60 on up depending on what you order. The best suggestion I can make if you want to save money is to go during lunch. You can get the lunch box and it has a little bit of everything. The owner is awesome he remembers everyone that comes on. Every time we walk in he makes us feel so welcome and he even remembers if we don't have kids with us or not. I highly recommend this place!!! :)",

Revolucion is that type of place.   Thanks to my fellow Yelpers, I had this on my \"wish list\" for a good while and on a \"date night\" with my better half, we received a \"day pass\" out of the suburbs for a night to visit Fountain Square.   \nWalking in to the main bar area in the front, you get a sense that a great deal of time and effort was put into getting the decor just right.  \nBut then, the special treat.  Walking through what has a feel of a magical portal to vacation-land (for grownups), you enter the Tiki Bar area and instant relaxation.   I must say that the service was excellent and our bartender was fun and made us feel at home.   \nThe menu is straightforward, with a nice variety of appetizers (pinchos), tacos and burgers.   No fuss, no muss.  Being on the veggie side of the street, I ordered and enjoyed the Taco de Papas - which is two tacos with roasted potatoes, poblanos, corn and queso fresco and crema.   Just right.   \nWe would highly recommend Revolucion for both the service and the food.   Another special gem in an outstanding neighborhood!",

The d\u00e9cor isn't one to write home about, primarily greenish booths that can be a little tight for those with a belly.  But I must say it looks better now than it did 25 years ago.\n\nThe menu has lots of items; soup, noodles, rice, and entrees and most under $10.  They give you a pen and paper to write down your order and we ordered 2 items using the menu number.  The black bean rice noodles came with lots of sauce and vegetables.  My colleague ordered the seafood with vegetables which had shrimp, fried squid, and squid.  Both of the dishes were good, but I liked the noodles better.\n\nThe prices are cheap, and our meal came to $20 with leftovers too! Come for the good food and don't expect much for service or atmosphere.  Or you could also order take out if you don't want to eat it.  They only take cash though but there's at ATM in the restaurant.",

Their shrimp is excellent and their tacos are good. Honestly I haven't had anything here that I didn't like. The food is really good and very authentic Mexican. Before taking your order they bring you chips and salsa. The chips are authentic themselves, which means they're not all salty as you would expect American chips to be. But you don't need them salty when there's salsa, plus they bring you limes which are an excellent addition if you squeeze them over the chips. \n\nThe staff is very friendly and helpful but not in your face as at some restaurants. The building is nice, and it's a really pleasant atmosphere. Plus the food doesn't take very long to come.\n\nIt's definitely not a fancy restaurant, so if you're looking for someplace for a special occasion you might want to look elsewhere. But it's clean, neat and extremely relaxing inside. So if you're looking for good Mexican food, this is definitely the place to go!",

We were seated next to the huge fish tank, which is like getting a front row seat at a concert. \nFor an appetizer, we started with the seared scallops, which were delicious. For dinner, my wife ordered the mahi and I had the grouper piccata. Both were great.  After dinner, we almost made a big mistake because we weren't sure if we were going to have dessert. Thankfully, our server, Jen Fig, told us that there was a new pastry chef who makes all the desserts in-house. Jen raved about the chef's newest creation, a lemon meringue cheesecake which I don't even think is on the menu yet. We had to try it and it seriously turned out to be one of the best desserts I've ever had. It was such a great way to end our evening. Thank you Jen!  I look forward to returning soon.",

It has by far the best ice cream in town. \n\nAs soon as you walk through the doors you take a step back in time. It reminds me of many hollywood movies based in the South- it definitely has that old world charm. \n\nThere are so many delicious flavors to try and it's usually hard to choose just one.  However, over time and many flavor tests I find that I tend to gravitate to chocolate flavors. My personal favorites at the Creole Creamery are the entire chocolate section  (located on your left as soon as you walk in); more specifically, the chocwork-orange (a dark creamy chocolate ice cream with a hint of orange flavor), the butterscotch english toffee (soooo good) and lavender honey (who doesn't love lavender?)\n\nWhat's your favorite flavor?",

I had to come here as soon as it opened to grab some coffee and sample their daily selection of donuts before my seminar started in the morning. \n\nNew Orleans is known for the buttermilk drop and while I didn't get a chance to try the one at Wink's in the French Quarter, I imagine the ones at District are a good representation. It's a cakey donut hole with sweet icing draped over it. Generally, I'm more a yeast donut fan but those buttermilk drops were delightful. I could have eaten a half dozen, no sweat. But there were other items to try. \n\nDistrict has \"croquenuts\" available which is their version of a griddled donut sandwich. I chose the \"Monte Cristo\" for it's sweet and savory combination. Gooey cheese and salty ham between a donut covered in powdered sugar with a hefty dollop of raspbery preserves nestled in the center of the donut. This was a magical creation. Get it if you have the chance.\n\nFinally, to top of my donut extravaganza, I chose the Miso Olive Oil Praline Bacon donut. It's a mouthful to say but wasn't to consume. Such a fascination combination of flavors from this donut. I chose it mostly for the bacon but the miso, olive oil, and praline each hit their notes with every bite. Simply wonderful. \n\nNot to forget was the the Vietnamese Iced Coffee to wash it all down. It was the jolt I needed to wake me up for this early morning call for donuts. \n\nYou bet I'll make another (or several) stops next time I'm in New Orleans.",

Paulie will keep you entertained with lively conversation, especially if you're talking about Chicago, but all the while slicing fresh vegetables for your order. Depending when you show up, you may catch Jade squeezing fresh lemons for a number of fresh lemonade flavors. Some items on the menu are seasonal, but that's ok because everything is prepared fresh and tastes great, and their prices are so low, you can afford to try it all. Next time you want a real Chicago Dog or an authentic Italian Beef (hot & wet, loaded with giardiniera) and want them to exceed your expectations, don't drive out of the way to stand in the cattle call at Portillo's, come see Paulie and Jade because it is better in every way.",

When we got to The Three Coins Diner we thought oh my. Are we going to be safe in this neighborhood and what kind of food are we going to get?\n\nWe entered the restaurant and we were told to seat ourselves. We looked at the menu and the prices were very reasonable. We ordered our meals.  Our meals were huge! My daughter had french toast and fruit. The fruit bowl was huge! My son had the country fried steak and eggs. I had 2 eggs, 4 pieces of bacon and 2 pancakes.  The food was great and so was the waitress. Our waitress kept coming up and asking if we wanted anything else. We haven't had service like that in a long time.  We will be coming back to this restaurant for sure!!!!",

As others have indicated, don't come here if you're in a hurry but if you've got time to wait, the food and staff are awesome!  We're from the Midwest and this is a true country diner, they only serve breakfast and lunch through the morning and early afternoon and the food has been absolutely delicious every time.  I read another post about some rude owners and staff here...not real sure where he went because they all go out of their way to make certain your visit is a good one and that you're taken care of.  Drinks are always topped off, food is hot and made to order, and always with a smile.  And the prices...we've never spent more than 10 bucks each including drinks!!  The scrambles are unbelievably delicious and my wife usually gets french toast which is clearly made fresh...no sitting under a heat lamp! On top of ALL that, they have a great military discount...can't beat it!  Must add this to your \"have to try\" list!!",

Yes, they do brew their own beer onsite (tours are available) and they have a nice bar area with plenty of seating.\n\nThey also have great, affordable food. I'm a big fan of their burgers, but have never ordered anything at Schlafly's that I didn't like. They also have a large outside patio area and sponsor a weekly farmer's market during the summer on their parking lot.\n\nI appreciate that they use local sustainable food and that the entire building was smoke free (even the bar) before the smoking ban went into place. They keep a fire going outside all winter in the patio space which gives the smokers a warm place to huddle. \n\nI've also been to several events with the back room with it's own bar and their bartenders will let you taste the beer until you find one you like.",

    "text": "As avid brewery connoisseurs and current Nashville locals, we were extremely and pleasantly surprised with our experience at Tennessee Brew Works this evening.\n\n It was a dreary, rainy night and as we pulled up we were fairly apprehensive about the string of dark warehouses and quiet alleys. It all changed quickly as we walked into the \"Tennessee Fill Station\" (or some name similar) portion of the building. The fellas working there directed us to the \"Tennessee Tap Room\" (or some name similar) portion of the building that overlooked 2 stories into the \"Tennessee Brew Works\" (or some name similar) portion of the building where the brewing takes place. I've added the specifics because this is the first group audacious and clever enough to pull off all three portions under one roof.... and to still comply with Tennessee's archaic liquor laws! If sticking it to the man isn't enough reason for you to check it out.... keep reading. \n\nThe tap room is super neat and cleverly laid out with patios, long & community-oriented tables, a flying bridge or \"catwalk\" and a steady stream of live, local music. It's largely non-smoking (which is enough to convince me to cross the bridge from East Nashville) and has a few TVs to cater to the football crowds. \n\nBiggest fortes:\n\n- The staff is amazing. The smiles and enthusiasm when they start talking about their beer are a sweet relief. They're excited! They're adventurous! They aren't pretentious. Real People.\n- The beers are fresh & different. They keep it local. They aren't afraid to venture from the norm. They add their own zing and flair.... and for that, I respect them.\n- They appreciate the food & beer pairing concept. They're bringing in great food to compliment their brews. It's a movement.\n\nIf you've managed to read all of that rambling- you can ignore any other reviews and just go ahead and get there.",

    "text": "Came to Smiley's after reading other Yelp reviews, and I was not disappointed! I ordered the beef gyro platter to go, and the portion was well worth the money. Myself and another person split the meal, and there was still some left over. The gyro meat is cut off of a huge slab right in front of you. Don't let its appearance put you off: it's delicious. The rice is delicious and doesn't feel heavy or greasy like some that I've had from other establishments in the past. With the platter you also get a huge helping of hummus and a bag full of delicious pita, and a little salad on the side. I'll definitely be back here to try some of the other menu items. I definitely need to try the baklava.",

Had delicious Oatmeal one day then, after deciding it was pointless to eat healthy in New Orleans, had fantastic omelettes for the rest of my stay.

    "text": "This was our first experience eating lunch at Cheddar's. Our server was Joey.  We really appreciated that our food was made after we ordered it, rather than being prepared hours before.  Joey brought us coffee and--my test of an attentive server--keep our coffee and water filled up.  When we were low on coffee, instead of warming up our coffee, he brought new cups.  This was typical of the excellent service.\n     The food was superb.  I had a medium-rare steak; it was actually cooked medium-rare, which does not always happen.  The flavor of all our entrees and side orders was very tasty.\n     We plan to go back frequently.  Heartily recommended.  The wait is noted in other reviews, and it's because of the quality of food.  If you want to avoid a line, go to a fast food place.",

Wachttijden kunnen oplopen, maar waar Nederland vaak faliekant in faalt, gaat hier geweldig: er wordt door t personeel vlijmscherp in de gaten gehouden wie er aan de beurt is, zelfs voor de krukken aan de bar. Bijna gingen er mensen die later waren gearriveerd dan wij er met onze lang verwachte krukken vandoor, maar de barman regelde dit op sublieme wijze. Het moraal van dit verhaal- je raakt hier niet ge\u00efrriteerd omdat andere mensen voor schnitzelen. Ondertussen word je getrakteerd op de lekkerste live muziek en hebben ze er heerlijke cocktails en prima wijnen. Eten was ondergeschikt deze avond, maar wat we hadden was bijzonder goed. Dikke aanrader- wellicht reserveren als je niet van eindeloos wachten houdt.",

My partner is an expatriate from NOLA, she and I are now living near San Francisco, and we came here *twice* for brunch over this past week.  (Granted, the second time was after the Ruby Slipper was too noisy ;).  I enjoyed the cornbread waffles, the Crabby Wife was complex and one of the most exciting brunch-y dishes I've had.  Yay for creativity and edge-pushing!",

The host, of course, were more than happy to accommodate me. They mentioned their Sweet Potato Agnolotti so I accepted. It was amazing. I also enjoyed their house Cabernet a lot. The room that was reserved for us was on the second floor. It was nice to be able to mix and mingle on the balcony before our event began. The host were phenomenal as well. I can't wait to return.",

The serving size is plentiful and the ingredients are very fresh. \n\nIt is set up like a chipotle and you pick what ingredients you would like. I would recommend adding a topping with some crunch like wonton crisps because it really adds to the overall texture. The tuna is definitely my favorite! Overall, it's an awesome lunch spot.

No problem. The place was not crowded when we arrived and we were promptly seated. When we left the place was full. I would suggest making reservations as I imagine on the weekend it is packed.\n\nOur waiter was very professional and helpful with recommendations. Our first wine selection couldn't be located but the recommended substitute was excellent.\n\nThe fresh, warm bread we started out with was very good. We shared the toasted raviolis and the mushrooms with polenta. Both were excellent. I would say these are some of the best toasted raviolis around.  It's very easy to tell they were never frozen. I ordered the \"Hay and Straw\" and loved it. I even had leftovers which is a rare event.

I was wrong. \n\nRarely do you stop at a place like this. I've been twice and both visits were everything I'd want for a nice, casual dining experience. The first time I went we were the only ones outside (it looked like it was going to rain... and it did). The servers offered to reseat us immediately but we actually opted to sit outside and watch the rain. Everything was covered so it wasn't like our server got drenched coming to our table. I had a salmon sandwich, she had a salad and we shared a cheese plate. Everything was portioned and presented very well. The wine and beer they recommend went with the lunch nicely - we had a great time, so we came back a month later. This visit was equally enjoyable. We sat at the sleek bar for a drink before being shown to our table. I feel this spot is the perfect W.

    "text": "Speaking as a current resident of the Florida gulf coast, and former resident of the central California coast, it pains me to admit it but the oysters at Luke are the best I've ever had. And I've had them picked same-day from the Monterey Bay. It surprised me to learn that the oysters are harvested from New Orleans, I had no idea that N.O. had access to such top notch shellfish. Anyways happy hour features deals on signature cocktails, 75 cent oysters and cheap apps, I went there twice during my week in N.O. and I should have gone more. \n\nOther than the amazing briny ice cold oysters, my wife and I also had a selection of various apps and cocktails all of which were in the good to excellent range. The one that really sticks out is the squash blossoms - do not miss this one even if trying new food scares you. They have a texture and flavor similar to a delicate bell pepper, and they are perfectly tempura battered and stuffed with tangy goat cheese with a little honey drizzle. It made me go home and plant a squash just so I can harvest the blossoms and recreate this dish. Luke hits a nice balance between casual and formal, from the atmosphere to the menu to the prices. Not to be missed.",

    "text": "Since moving to Fishtown this summer, my other half and I have had a few meals at Lloyd, and we consider it to be one of our favorite spots in the neighborhood.\n\nMeal favorites: For Sunday brunch, I loved the McLloyd - pancakes smothered in maple syrup with eggs, cheese, and sausage - perfect if you like sweet and savory together for breakfast. He had the Cuban Benedict special, which had an excellent flavor. They have great food specials for dinner and brunch, but some of our dinner favorites include the savory chicken waffle small plate (shareable) and the Lloyd Burger.  \n\nYou can't go wrong with drinks. The bourbon sweet tea is amazing, and the Manhattan was one of the best I've ever had. We have also tried some of their whiskey flights, which are reasonably priced and great whiskeys that we might not have otherwise stumbled upon. Last but not least, they have great happy hour specials, and the classic Citywide shot and beer combo. \n\nThis is a great spot any day of the week. We enjoy the low key atmosphere and friendliness of the waitstaff and bartenders.",

I had a lamb special, which was incredible, and my wife's pasta was also very good. \n\nA couple weird things: 1) the space is a little small, to the point where the servers are tripping over each other; 2) the music choice was strange for an Italian place (mid-90s country) - I wasn't looking for Dean Martin or anything, but it was an odd choice.",

It's always so exciting to try new cafes and ice cream places that pop in Reno since there really isn't many trendy places like these. It was interesting to see the cute wired sign and pink wall. The man at the register said him and his fianc\u00e9 started this business so I wish them both luck! He was very welcoming very informative. The soft serve is so creamy-- the way it should be. The flavors are so yummy, it was nice to see familiar flavors like Ube and green tea. For some suggestions maybe a Thai tea or strawberry flavor? It was nice that we were offered pocky sticks to add to our krem creation. Maybe next time if adding wafer sticks or some type of cookies would be nice. I got the ube baby baby and it was delicious!

Excellent food, fun atmosphere and an overall great experience. I had the kalamata muffuletta and it was insanely good. A little bit out of the way and totally unassuming from the outside, but don't let that deter you. Highly recommend.",

    "text": "Han Dynasty is one of my favorite restaurants in Philadelphia.  I first found the Manayunk location, and my wife and I ate there several times.  We heard about it from a friend who turned us on to the spicy cucumbers, which are just wonderful.\n\nEventually I tried the University City location, and it's much more \"hip.\"  I really don't care about ambiance, but if you are seeking a more polished/trendy type of place, go to University City over Manayunk.  The food in both places is just incredible.\n\nHan Dynasty serves food in very large, family sized portions.  It's most fun when you are with a bit of a group, so you can order a number of different things, and try them all.\n\nOn their \"specials\" menu, they have Spicy Aroma Fish which is just absolutely beyond this world.  SO good.  Another major hit was the dry pot style.  My wife and I are big seafood fans, so we get shrimp as the protein, but you have complete flexibility to pick whichever protein suits your taste.\n\nThey have numbers on the menu, 1-10, beside each dish.  This is the relative spiciness rating.  It's really hard to describe the type of heat in these Szechuan dishes... it isn't the kind of heat that just burns your mouth.  The heat is very strong, but it's all flavor.  \n\nDry pepper style is another type of preparation that we have tried and loved.\n\nSeveral reviews mention the Dan Dan noodles... they are wonderful, but they are indeed rather oily.  It's just the nature of this cuisine.  I think the food is wonderfully prepared, one just has to know that chili oil and sesame oil will make the food a bit on the oily side.  \n\nAbsolute top notch rating for this place.  Love it!",

It is an inviting restaurant upon arrival, really cool place to look around in as your waiting for a pick up or a seat. The cashier was very welcoming and asked me if it was my first visit. After yes he offered samples of anything on the menu and recommended the most popular dishes. I was informed that almost all the dishes were similar to a stew or soup served over rice. My order was the drunk chicken with a vegetarian option for only 7.50! I was very surprised with the affordability of a full plate. Since I ordered to go I received my food in a simple styrofoam clam shell container. The presentation was pretty lackluster, but food doesn't need a fancy container or complicated presentation to be delicious, that's exactly what this was! This was some of the best food I've stumbled upon in Indianapolis. The drunken chicken was so flavorful with just just a tad of spice. Vegetables were sweet and tender, for vegetarians is a terrific option. Great size portions for the price. Five stars for service and delicious food I will definitely be coming back!",

Food is of great quality and nice quantity. \n\nWaitstaff are some of the best in the City. I have never ever been disappointed with a server, manager, buser or host. One time a buser overheard my dad talking about a particular beer that was no longer on tap for the season. My dad was bummed because he had just discovered it and wasn't able to find it anymore. 15 minutes later the young man dropped off a mini-pint at our table and told us he had looked and found a tiny reserve in the back.

Sometimes twice daily... except Sunday because they aren't open. *sad*\n\nI love their Alien's Nectar and Green Lantern Juices - I'm addicted! Their acai bowls are out of this world delicious. Also when they make a smoothie with dates it ends up smooth (versus the place across the street that can't seemml to make juice or smoothies that flow easily up straws!)\n\nGet the cocoa-nut smoothie with date butter..  you won't be sorry fellow chocolate lovers. Or one if the pineapple coconut smoothies... oh so good!\n\nThe prices at this store are on par with other natural grocers. Staff is super friendly and I swear they put extra love in each item. Tip them! \n\nI wish they were open Sunday!",

I've ordered delivery from them three times and have dined in once. The delivery was exceptionally quick, which makes me believe that most of the food is already made before you order it. It's not piping hot and fresh, but it still tastes great. The buffalo bella and fries are definitely my favorite items. If you're looking for something more upscale, try Vedge, but if you're starved and you need a quick vegan bite delivered to your office quickly, you can't go wrong with HipCity.",

    "text": "This place is amazing. Everything is sooo good and I have defiantly been here enough to say I have tried almost everything on the menu. All the workers are friendly and work so hard to keep the line that is usually out the door under control. I have never been in a place that is so busy and still get customers served in a timely fashion. Some of these reviews say this place is in a bad area... Are yall serious? It's right off the interstate and if you go in there over night there is always a police officer.(I think the police officer is there because of the amount of customers in there at one time). Let's just start with the donuts. They r amazing. They have the best donuts around. I love donuts so I have been to just about every donut shop in the Nola area. And these r the best!!!  The donuts are usually hot and they can usually make any special order u want. All U have to do is ask. Whenever I want special orders I call early in the morning and they can usually have it done by noon. The apple fritters here are so good as well!!!  Red velvet cake and Reese peanut butter are my favorites oh wait the Oreo donut is just as good!  Next let's move on to kastleburgers... These kastleburgers are a New Orleans original and no one can top them. These people have to entire process of cooking kastleburgers down to a science. ( or so it appears). I have seen the crystal across the street but any one that is local knows tastee's kastleburgers are so Much better. Does anyone even go to crystal?  Also just like the donuts you can Special order the kastleburgers. They are always made  fresh. The breakfast is so good as well. They use real products. It is defiantly made to order and not typical fast food breakfast. U can order anything u can imagine for breakfast. I have seen people eating hot sausage egg and cheese sandwiches and I have seen all different types of breakfast platters served. They also have a huge selections of po boys and sandwiches that u can order 24/7. Now the hot plates they serve here are so good. They have everything and it's all home cooked u can taste it. It reminds me of when I was little and my grandma fixed me red beans and rice. They also have this pasta defiantly homemade it is so good it has crawfish and shrimp in it.  The gumbo is good as well. All I can say is pass up all other donut shops and come her for the full New Orleans style donut experience. This is an old time genuinely good donut shop the donuts taste the same as they did when I was a child it's so nice to have a restaurant/ donut shop that doesnt take the easy way out cut corners and produce a not so good product. This place is the best donut shop around.",

A brunch place that I don't need to go into the city for or a global chain restaurant.\n\nI have been here for breakfast & lunch (Marlton & Cherry Hill)  and both times I have been here the food has been spot on!! Everyone at our table enjoyed their food!!  The food is fresh, unique & not greasy like some diner food in the area. I recommend the Marsala Eggs Benedict very good & different and the Benedict sauce was tasty just wish the sauce was a little warmer. I like my poached eggs juicy 1 of the eggs was over cooked for me. I would recommend telling them how you like your eggs cooked. Overall a great place for sunday brunch!! Also don't forget the champange for mamosas!!   \n\nThe wait staff is also great!! Very accommodating without the hidden charges!!  They asked if we would like any of our drinks in a to-go cup.\n\nTurning Point I recommend that you serve the Marsala Benedict in the big spoon serving dish like the others benedict dishes that is a great way of keeping the sauce from the potatoes & everything all on one plate",

I've had the grits, bacon, eggs, biscuits, fruit salad with whipped cream, cornbread........and it is all delicious.  This is one of the best brunch places in the city.\n\nIn addition to great food the service is also very good.  They are attentive without being intrusive.  The only con is that the location is small, which makes for long waits on the weekend for brunch.  Here's a tip - If you arrive after 1:30/2pm on Sunday....you will be seated right away.\n\nEnjoy!",

It actually had big pieces of crap in it, something that you usually don't get because many restaurants are cheap when it comes to seafood. I had the Gourmet Cheesesteak sandwich and I think after all the cheesesteak sandwiches I've had in Philly this is by far the best! The sandwich is a mixture of sliced rib eye (very good) and their filet mignon angus beef. They top it with vidalia onions and Cooper American cheese, i seriously dont think anything else will top this. My wife ended up having the Filet Mignon and that was great also. She mentioned, \"oh man i forgot to ask for steak sauce\" but as soon as she cut into it the steak was so juicy she said it didn't even need any sauce. Also I really recommend the BubbleGum drink, it was a great mixture of alcohols and it was surprisingly very good.",

The two years I've taken part in this event have just been a blast.\n\nThe Schlafly event room in the back-- I forget the name of it, but I think it has one-- is just a fun and unique place to have a private event.  The view of the Bottleworks is impressive, and the huge private bar set up on the side is just great.  I think the cost is pretty reasonable for us, too, which includes unlimited beer/wine per head along with a bunch of delicious hors d'oeuvre.\n\nI'm a member of the group that helps put the event on this year, and I definitely think we're sticking with the Bottleworks again.  Look forward to an updated review around February or March next year!",

You can't go wrong with anything on the menu.  I love the cowboy burger, but my favorite is to share the seafood platter with my wife and child.  I one thing they don't have is soft shell crab.  Don't worry about dessert, you can have all the soft serve ice cream you want.   The fry is seasoned just right the potato wedges are heavenly done.  Probably not good for my body but GOOOOD for my Soul!  If you can't find something you like there's a problem.",

NO MATTER WHAT YOU ORSER, IT WILL BE DELICIOSO!\n\nThe quality is second to none, the service is fantastic, the kitchen (open to the public eye) is extremely clean!  Atmosphere is elegantly relaxed and comfortable. Don't let the cloth tanle cloths fool you. You will be as comfortable in shorts or jeans as you wod in a buusiness suit.\n\nMy favorite entrees are (first and foremost) the Gorganzola stuffed shrimp. They are huge and the sauce they drizzle over them is beyond description! Suffice to say my taste bud have a monumental fiesta en la boca ( party in the mouth)! Tip: request extra sauce on the side to dip some shrimp into to coat....yuummm!\n\nThe salmon on a cedar plank is also so awesome.  \nThe Chiles Rellenos are also delicious.\n\nJust notE that they do change up the menu but if there is something you like, just ask. Some things on the lunch menu aren't on the dinner one and vice versa.  They are very accomodating. Soooool if the shrimp aren't on the menu, ask them for it! \n\nWhatever you have you can't go wrong with this place!",

The ambience was calm and relaxing and our server Jay was very kind. We started with the fried shrimp wantons which were great, and our three dishes: curry goat, curry shrimp and curry chicken roti were all flavorful. The roti was so soft! A mild taste for all backgrounds, but they were happy to bring out a side of pepper sauce for my dad who needed a kick. The owner Anthony was kind enough to greet us and explain the meaning behind the name of the restaurant. The peanut punch is a must have. The food was authentic and satisfied my Trinidadian mother!

I got a side order of the battered green beans. They were suppose to be spicy, but I was told they didn't make them spicy that particular day. Well, okay then. I ordered them anyways and I was so glad that I wasn't deterred by the fact that they weren't spicy because they were the most lightly battered, perfectly crunchy, and delicious green beans I have ever tasted. To top it off, the beautiful Santa Barbara County day made the outdoor ambiance the most perfect date for my husband and I.",

Thankfully they have their own parking lot but there's plenty of street parking too, which is good because it was packed. The inside was nice and cozy and it had plenty of seating, not that it mattered because it was so crowded but I can't fault them for that.\n\nThe customer service was really good, although the guy who took our order didn't seem to believe that I knew what a double shot macchiato would be because he kept asking me if I had ever had one before. I badly needed pure caffeine so it was just what I wanted, I'm just not sure what the questioning about my choice was all about.\n\nThat being said, when I got it it was great, obviously good quality espresso. My husband got their popular hot chocolate which he wasn't a fan of but I really liked since it tasted like actual chocolate instead of like a powder. He also got an espresso bar which was some kind of sugary chocolate treat, and he loved that. Their to go cups are also really cute. It's out of the way but we'll definitely be back.",

She always answered my emails right away and made sure that everything was perfect on the day of.  We had the front room for 30 people, and it was a perfect amount of space.  We were all close and cozy without being overcrowded.  It really was such a lovely day!\n\nI chose to have fresh fruit and Danish, orange juice carafes for the champagne I brought for mimosas, and a choice of three entrees for the guests.  Everyone was very happy with the food, which came out really quickly after ordering.  Our main server was Jess, who was AWESOME.  Our other server (I want to say Molly... she is the assistant to Dan) was also AWESOME.  They were so nice and personable and really concerned with making sure everything was perfect.\n\nThe planning was easy, the staff is wonderful, the food is great, the restaurant is adorable and in a great location.  I would recommend to anyone planning an event that they check out West Ave Grille.  It is laid back and intimate.",

Exactly how i like it!  Unfortunately, the hubby isn't into jambalaya, so we don't order it often.  \nRed beans and rice- traditional & delicious\nBrisket Gumbo- so tender, smokey, ridiculously good.  \nMuffaletta- this is one thing that you typically cannot find outside of NOLA.  Many places do their own variation, but the bread and the olive salad makes the dish.  I had heard that Serpes bakes rolls specifically for their muffs and I had to try it.  Spot on!

At $150 ( Heineken) that's $1 a beer!!!!!  You can rent the keg for as long as you need.  But the beer begins to degrade after a day or 2 if you don't have a kegerartor. But I'm pretty sure a few keg stands will solve the problem of any left overs.  Not only do they provide a keg with a large list of beers for your to order.  You can ask to rent a tub ( to keep it cold) and the pump.  There are deposits for these items. But will get it back once returned.  Really makes me want to look into buying a kegerartor now. I would totally keep a keg next to bed.\n\n\nNot only can you choose from a great selection of beers. There are also different size kegs you could order depending on your needs.  Love this great service.  Thank you for keeping Tampa slightly tipsy total wine. Life and spirits go great together!",

That's what you'd compare pasta from Boston Pizza or Sbarro with.\nBut anyways, I'm not a huge pasta enthusiast - I never really crave it. But my boyfriend does and whenever he mentions this place I get a pasta hankering. \nI usually order the Borsetti (I think that's what it's called) and it always tastes delicious and fresh. All the salads and soups I've had there are great as well.\nThe service can be a bit slow sometimes but that's hardly worth taking a star away.",

I ordered the steak and eggs.  It comes with a side and fruit salad.  The steak was about a 6 oz. ribeye which I ordered medium-rare with eggs over-easy.  Service was excellent and our meal was delivered promptly despite the fact that the restaurant and bar were at full capacity.  Biting into the steak I was amazed.  It was char-grilled to perfection, tender and sooo flavorful.  Completely unlike most breakfast steaks you get.  I daresay this steak was better than many I've had at high-end chop houses!  The eggs were perfect.  While the hashbrowns were OK, I am not a fan.  They were quartered new potatoes with a batter that was sugared.  Hashbrowns shouldn't be sweet!  Overall a tremendous experience gastronomically.  Katie's usually has a lot of specialty dishes off the menu (Check the chalkboards at the doorways), but if you're there for breakfast/brunch - get the steak & eggs!",

It is a hang over cure for the Vanderbilt and Belmont University set so weekends after 9am will be a bear to get in. The line can stretch for hours and blocks BUT once you get in the service is fast and efficient. \n\nThe cool factor is that I have gone in on a weekday found myself a scant table or two from Vince Gill or Kevin Costner quietly enjoying breakfast without much fanfare. \n\nNow the pancakes are obviously the thing to go with on the menu. I usually get a half order because I have a small appetite. My favorites are the sugar and spice because the syrup is something out for this world. I also like the chocolate chip because they drizzle the chips on top. So you mix the half melted chocolate chips with the half melted butter and then you poor a little bit of syrup on the pancakes and it's nothing short of a religious experience. \n\nThe coffee is just OK.",

Before I took a bite of pizza or a sip of the finest brew served there, I was hooked.  Pinball machines.  Ms Pac Man.  You had me at hello.  And an amazing juke box to go along with it all.\n\nSo the pizza.  Folks, do not eat all day and I bet you cannot eat more than two pieces.  The any and all chicago deep dish has literally everything but the kitchen sink on it.  Beware if you do not like jalepeno peppers because they are loaded up on there.  You can create your own from an array of toppings or sometimes, I just like the cheese pizza.  Folks, I swear the cheese pizza alone must weight ten pounds.  \n\nExcellent ambiance.  Not a place to go if you are in a hurry as you will wait at least one hour on a Chicago style pizza.  Great place to go on a Friday night.  Get caught up with friends and just sit around shooting the shit.  Excellent beer selection especially on tap.  \n\nDo your tastebuds a favor and go!",

I will never eat another supermarket cupcake ever again. You can get classic cupcakes or unique exotic ones.

    "text": "For context, I've previously always been, somewhat to my embarrassment, generally more fond of fancy/trendy donuts (do-rite in Chicago, sidecar in LA, etc) than your mom-and-pop style donut. Always thought the high-quality ingredients and inspired flavor combinations made the calories more worth it. \n\nSt. Louis is an anomaly. The hipster donut offerings here are a wretched disappointment. Sorry Strange, your toppings are decent, but the donuts themselves are weirdly dry and thick. Sorry Vincent Van Doughnut...actually, I'm not sorry - you should be sorry for selling me that chocolate-coffee abomination. That's the first donut I ever left unfinished. It's literally sprinkled with coffee grounds. It would take some insanely good chocolate to carry that, but instead you thinly coated the donut with some mediocre dark chocolate.\n\nThankfully, the anomaly works both ways. This homestyle shop has some truly excellent stuff, for insanely low prices. Chocolate icing has much more depth of flavor than your average cheap-donut-chocolate. Blueberry cakes are light, fresh, and fruity - perfectly sweet. Buttermilks are rich and satisfying. All worth coming back for, but oh, the apple fritters. Deep fried perfection.\n\nIf there exists an apple fritter better than the ones here, I will most definitely live off the things for the rest of my (likely very short) life.",

There is no better cake on the planet! It was a bit of a splurge to have one shipped to me, but so worth it. Wow! The memories it brought back!!! It arrived in perfect condition and right on time. They've improved the shipping on these cakes. I ordered one a few years ago, and the frosting peeled off when I peeled off the plastic wrapping. Not any more! It was just perfect this time!\n\nMy other favorite splurge is getting the amazing king cakes at Mardi Gras time. They're the best! I bring them to work and everyone flips out over them. My daughters in college expect them now too. They get the king cakes, beads, etc, and have gotten lots of attention in the dorms because of them! One daughter said that people will say they will just have a little sliver, then they always come back for more. The baby in the king cake is always a fun topic for Californians to learn about. \n\nThanks for helping me to relive my childhood memories!!!",

    "text": "Well done Saint Louis. I didn't dream of having a Boiling Crab-esque restaurant out here, but here I am. Mad Crab met my expectations and then some. The \"whole shabang\" (aka: whole shebang) medium and mild seasoning was amazing! The half dozen oysters tasted beautifully fresh and the staff were gracious in my requests for salt and pepper and hella limes.\n\nI think this is a great first date place! Take advantage of the fact that you and your date can get messy together in a fun and casual setting! And, if he/she doesn't like cajun seafood, you know they're not the one!\n\nMy advice to the management, if they read reviews, is to have their wait staff add that extra human touch by tying the bibs for their customers. Boiling Crab does that and that extra little service goes a long way. In addition, consider providing wet wipes for their customers with their check.\n\nOverall, well done and I'll be sure to recommend Mad Crab to my Saint Louis friends.",

    "text": "We were in Philadelphia for one night and were really craving Spanish food!  We found this place and were immediately excited.  No one was in the restaurant which made us a bit skeptical at first, but later we realized it's because most people get takeout!  This place has so much variety and gives huge portions.  I got a skirt steak with yellow rice and it was fantastic.  My friend got Chicken and Shrimp in a garlic sauce.  We both enjoyed our food very much and it was very reasonably priced.  We ended the meal by sharing a piece of tres leches cake (which was fantastic) and coffee.  The coffee cups were  a little small but it did the trick.\n\nThis is a great low key place with great food.\n\nI will definitely be back when in the area and I would highly recommend!",

    "text": "Well, I hope I don't offend the BBQ police with this review....but I didn't order ANY BBQ here....what I did order was, possibly, the best hot chicken sandwich I have ever had....no small feat in a town that DOMINATES the world of hot chicken.\n\nI was convinced to try out Edley's when a friend in town billed it as 'unique and gourmet BBQ'....OK, I'm not sure exactly what that means, but what the hell, I'll give it a whirl!  I like good BBQ, but I LOVE good Nashville Hot Chicken, and that just jumped out at me on the menu.  So, I throw in my order for a hot chicken sandwich....I was mildly alarmed when I was told that it only came in one level of hotness and they couldn't give me any hot sauce on the side (they did offer wing sauce).  Despite some mild reservations upon this discovery (what kind of REAL hot chicken place doesn't offer some type of 'this will kill you from the inside out' level of spice?), I pushed ahead with the order.  Damn, I AM a brave man.\n\nWe sit down and the order comes out just a few minutes later.  Here we go...after de-pickling it, I dig in.  First thing I notice is the breading: not as thick as your 'standard' hot chicken, but full of flavor.  I actually liked it better....seems lighter (but I know it's not more healthy, I'm not kidding myself on that).  The chicken was really tender and cooked perfectly.  The spice what a LITTLE on the light side, but still had enough heat for you to know it was there.  \n\nAnyway, I am a HUGE fan of this place....great food, full bar, nice set up inside, and a great patio as well.  Throw a great location on top of that, and what else could you ask for?",

My sister is a vegetarian and often has a hard time finding good options when we go out, so she was delighted to see a variety of great choices (the mushroom empanadas were her favorite!). \n\nThe service was really great--the waiter was really helpful in helping us pick out beers/cocktails (try the sangria!). Great restaurant!",

After a trolley ride and wandering around, we finally made it. The environment is really comfortable with pictures of patrons on the bright walls. What makes this place special is the homemade and unique ice creams. If you can't decide, they will let you sample a bunch of flavors. You can even get half scoops. I came back several times during my stay in NOLA!\n\nHere's the flavors I got:\n-lavender honey (my fav)\n-red velvet\n-chocolate amaretto cheesecake\n-almond toffee\n\nHighly recommended!",

For what is expected of Chinese food, it is on the pricier side, but all well worth it.  My favorite recommendations include Dan Dan noodles, Dry Pepper Chicken/Shrimp, and Cumin Lamb.

My recommendation for chaat: go for the mild, even if you like really spicy food. It's not because it's super spicy (it still has a kick though) but because the balance of flavors is better with the mild chaat. The spicy chaat, the spiciness overpowers the rest of the goodies and it gets a bit too saucy for me. As for lassis, I've had the mango, rose, and mint - all I would recommend.",

It is right next to where H-Mart  begins, across from Paris Baguette.They have an incredible selection of delicious hot and cold prepared foods.Outstanding choices to die for are the spicy chicken pieces(breast) w/sweet & sour sauce, wings(rival Cafe Soho, but cheaper), and the spicy blue  crab soup.Everything I have tried here has been nothing short of fresh and delicious. Other items you can't go wrong with are the Soft Tofu Seafood Soup, japchae,(although I prefer the H-mart japchae cause you get like twice as much for the same price),the fried squid,gimbap, box lunches, mak kimchi,and savory pancakes.\n\nTheir prices are incredibly reasonable with most things $5-$6. The box lunches are $6 and I had an amazing one last week consisting of Beef Bulgogi, Rice, Kimchi, Japchae, 2 pan fried savory dumplings and one sweet fried thing that I had no idea what it was 'cept it was incredible! I think it was some type of deep-fried flour-type ball of goodness.I'm still dreaming of that lunch. Not all items are always available. There sometimes is a bit of a language barrier; however most things are labeled and the woman who work there are friendly ans will help you as much as they can.\n\nI always check in on this place when I shop @ H-Mart to see if they have the Spicy Blue Crab soup. Today I lucked out and they had some. There was a woman who was buying like 10 qts. of the stuff. Turns out she is taking back home to Wisconsin to freeze it. You know it's special when folks come from out of state to buy it.\n\nSome of their foods are pretty spicy for occidental palates; but isn't that what Korean food is supposed to be?

It was also difficult to flag her down. Still, she was friendly and polite and the order was accurate.\nFood was delicious. We got the wings, potato skins and their famous spinach dip. Everything was cooked to perfection. Generous portions. Food came in about 20 minutes while we drank .\nBeer was tasty and went down easily. I liked the selection.\nHappy hour was nice with a dollar off drafts and half price apps.",

    "text": "Trident never disappoints for me.  It's going to largely be bar cuisine but I find it quite delightful.  I go here not when I'm in the mood for something healthy (though the Paleo Bowl would fulfill that if  you are looking for something healthy) I go here when I went delicious bar food.\n\nIf you like regular nachos, the kind with real melted cheese (not fake cheese sauce), these are some of the best you can get.  They're nothing crazy, no unique twist, just damn good nachos.  If you want fancier nachos, try elsewhere.  But here is going to be one of your best options for straight up regular delicious nachos.  The half portion is more than sufficient for one person.  I cannot even imagine trying to tackle the full portion. I'm a vegetarian so I never get it with beef, but you can totally add a meat option should you wish.\n\nAlso delicious is their mac and cheese.  It's so cheesy, never dried out, and always has some nice cheese melted right on top.  You can get it as a side with many of their burgers, or you can order the entr\u00e9e sized.  And in my opinion, you can never go wrong by adding green chiles to the mac and cheese.  Because green chilis are a gift.\n\nI love their caprese appetizer as well.  Standard mozzarella, tomato, basil, balsamic.  But it's always tasty.  Same with the mozzarella sticks.  Their white bean hummus plate is also delicious.\n\nThe other thing I love about trident is they do what, in my opinion, all restaurants with burgers should do, they say at the top you can take any burger and substitute a veggie patty.  It's baffling to me how many places don't even offer a veggie burger at all (they're frozen!  not that hard to keep them stocked!) or if they do, they're hesitant or unwilling to accommodate a request to add it to a different burger than the one veggie burger listed on the menu.  Why in the world, if you already have veggie patties on hand, do I have to order the ONE veggie burger you have listed?  Why can't I just substitute the veggie patty onto any other option?  It drives me bonkers.  But for Trident, this is never the case!  The mushroom swiss looks good to you?  They'll make it with a veggie patty.  The green chile burger looks great?  They'll make it a veggie.  Etc., etc., etc.  It's a standard Boca Burger, which are ok.  Normally I avoid Boca Burgers, but Trident makes me excited to eat a veggie burger!  I recommend the Green Chile with a Boca Burger, and add a fried egg.  Side salad and no bun if you want low carb.  Or, if you're indulging, side of mac & cheese.\n\nFor non-vegetarians, my friends are always happy to eat here too.  Popular choices among my friends include the grilled shrimp skewers, the non-veggie burgers, the crispy shrimp po-boy, and the paleo bowl.\n\nThey also have a fully stocked bar.  Good prices on their beverages.  And the wait staff has always been friendly and kind.\n\nWord of caution, if there's football on, it's probably going to be crowded here.  So plan accordingly.",

We also got some crabs to share, they were a good size and were warm and cleaned. \n\nI chose to get one of the specials, the Salmon, and WOW was I impressed. It was cooked so perfectly. A slight crunch on the outside (not burnt) and juicy on the inside. It was honestly the best salmon I ever had. There was a corn succotash on top and it came with orzo, because I can't have gluten I chose to sub broccoli. \n\nI am impressed with Dagwoods every time I come.

    "text": "I've been in the Carollwood/Tampa area since 1988 and it surprises the heck out of me that there are still great places tucked away that I've not only not been to but also not really heard of.  I saw Gio's listed on a list of italian restaurants in the area and decided to try it out.  \nGio's is towards the back of the set of strip stores anchored by Marshalls just north of Waters.  In fact, coming from the north, I was directed by the GPS to take the left off of Dale Mabry onto Humphrey, then a right on N. Himes and a right on Waters and pull into the area by Gold's Gym.  This actually turned out to be the best way there considering the work traffic heading north around 6 pm on both Dale Mabry and Waters..  \nWe got there around 6 pm on a Wednesday night and the place was somewhat empty.  There were about 8 other customers seated at one table and that was it.  By the time we left, around 7:00 pm, another 20 customers had piled in and were seated.  \nMy wife and I started off with two glasses of California (Foxbrook?) Cabernet wine and a Caprese salad.  The salad was 3 slices of tomatoes and mozzarella in a vinaigrette dressing and chopped basil on a bed of mixed greens.  The dressing was a perfect mix of balsamic vinaigrette oil.  I hate it when the vinaigrette is over powering and too sharp.  This wasn't\nMy wife had a entree of eggplant parmesan with a side of linguine pasta.  Half eaten and half came home.  Was it good?  \"yes, indeed\".  She is a Tiramisu groupie at heart and finished with that as dessert.  Timamisu?  \"excellent, creamy, flavorful\".\nMy entree was the Veal Bellavista which was a veal scallopini saut\u00e9ed with mushrooms, artichokes, capers in a lemon butter sauce with a side of saut\u00e9ed mixed vegetables.  Excellent.  The cabernet was a subtle cabernet, not an overpowering one that tastes great with a large grilled steak so it complemented the entire meal.  \nI finished with a double expresso.  \n\nService:  attentive but not overbearing.  helpful and willing to hold a conversation with you if you so enjoy.  Otherwise, respectful.  \n\nAtmosphere: great, simple decorations and pictures, background Italian music at this time of day.  \n\nPrice:  somewhat pricey but worth it for a special day or that once a month visit.  \n\nGoing back:  Definitely.  While we were there a friend of mine facebooked and said he would be in the Tampa area next month and wanted to hook up.  Why not here?",

I can't believe I didn't make it here sooner.\n\nI don't know which I liked better, the owner or the ham croqueta sandwich.  He was super friendly, making sure to talk to everyone and was happy he didn't have to deport anyone for not liking his food, which I don't think is possible.\n\nThe sandwich was bigger than I expected and loaded.  There was more ham on it than I normally eat at Christmas dinner, yet at the end, I was somehow wanting more.  The black bean soup was the perfect side dish.

There is a limited amount of seating and the restaurant is the very end of the Santa Barbara pier; it is in walking distance of many of the hotels close to the water in SB.  \n\nThe Shellfish Company is a good name for this restaurant as there is all kind of yummy seafood.  I opted for the Maine Lobster tacos that had fresh avocado, a spicy mayo dip on the side, lettuce, tomatoes, served on 2-double tortillas with rice.  The wine menu is generic, but I had a nice glass of Santa Barbara Wine Company Chardonnay along with a 2nd glass of generic White Zin.  They do not have espresso or dessert, but that was no big deal as the experience was perfect.  Good window views and seats at the bar... it is small and I would anticipate on the weekends the place is near impossible to get into.

    "text": "I think the secret is now out about this place. The day I went, a Friday, it was packed with a big bunch of everyone, a lot of office workers, grabbing lunch.\n\nThis is a fast, spacious, bright, comfortable, spotlessly clean, well managed, counter-service local Vietnamese chain (also locations in Bryn Mawr and Springfield, Montgo. Co.). They take your order via touchscreen and serve reliable Vietnamese standards: pho, bun (vermicelli), banh mi, and broken rice plates. Service is friendly and speedy. Portions are on the large side. It's a little more expensive than the Viet dining options you would find on Washington Ave., but you're paying for convenience and speed. The pho is delicious, the vermicelli servings are generous and topped with crunchy fried shallots, and the banh mi are stuffed full of crunchy, brightly colored carrots and veggies. You can add on typical toppings like sriracha, hoisin, nuoc cham (fish sauce), and crushed peanuts. Everything looks even better in real life than on the touchscreen menus. Even if there's a bit of wait, it's still quick and definitely worth it.\n\nThis is a such a dependably tasty place to go for lunch, if you're anywhere near JFK Blvd. or Market, or on the west side of Center City, or even if you're visiting from out of town and walking up to the Parkway from the Rittenhouse area. For folks who live in CC or Fairmount, it's conveniently located across from Trader Joe's and easy to get to in just a few minutes by trolley from University City or West Philly. Thank God they opened a Center City location. I could pretty much stand to eat lunch here every day!\n\nIts location is convenient for daytime Vietnamese eats, but it would be awesome if a Vietnamese place like this were open during late-night hours around the 13th St. corridor, on the east side of Center City, or within walking distance of Center City bars. It would, I predict, make bank.",

I had never tried falafels prior to my visit to the the Falafel Nazi/ Falafel King (I know this is not PC, and no offense is intended), but it is an appropriate title to give him. It doesn't just communicate how great the food is, but the experience you'll have. \n\nThe standard Center City lunch crowd knows this unmarked cart on 20th, and it usually has a long line in front of it. Prepare for passerby's to make comments on how you're waiting in line, inquiring as to what it is for, and pretty much just staring at you. *Tip* show up just before 12:00pm to limit the waiting. We got there at 11:45 and still had to wait 40 minutes. \n\nThere is no menu. Get used not to making choices. The cart is run by one man, and he is eccentric, but entertaining. He clearly has a passion for his food. You'll receive what he serves, but expect hummus, falafel, and chicken. He changes it up based on his shopping that week, and I had had a mix of watercress, apples, melons with mine. The sauce was spicy and divine. \n\nIt's worth the wait.\n\n*Remember: Cash only!",

Loved the look of it when we first walked in as it resembles an old fashioned ice cream parlor, Next the plethora of unique flavors. The hardest part was deciding on which flavors to choose. The mini scoop samplers are the way to go, that way you can try a variety. I got a sampler and I cannot say there was one flavor I did not like. This place is a must stop. Oh, and the staff was super friendly too, even with a line out the door. Cash only",

This restaurant is officially my new \"go to.\" \n\nThey DO NOT charge per glass of ice tea.

To be more descriptive it's cooked true to order, excellent flavor, very tender and much better than your average filet.\" \n\nI am so very glad I gave them a second chance. Even having the manager personally reach out to us in effort to right a wrong speaks volumes about this restaurant's quality and customer care. \n\nThis is a \"must try\" for all gulch residents and all who visit. \n\n\n\n\n\n am",

We started with the beef empanadas and chicken empanadas which were some of the best I have ever had. We also got the cheese bread which was delectable and so soft and moist. For my entree, I got their sampler plate which came with the chicken curry, which was out of this world tender and very tasty, the jerk chicken, which was way to spicy for my liking, and the brown stew which was also very good. Other than the spiciness of the jerk chick, which is how it is supposed to be, I have nothing I could even think to complain about this place.

Lunch comes with soup and salad, which is rare for this area. The salad is great, with fresh greens (not romaine, or iceberg) and GREAT ginger dressing. It's perfect. \n\nThere are many options for the sushi lunches and all great. My mother is in love with the salmon tempura and my boyfriend is obsessed with the mushroom shiitake. He is vegetarian and they have multiple sushi options for him.  The spicy mayo is fantastic, FYI. \n\nThe bento boxes are great and filling since they give you a lot of food!! Plus it's yummy. I recommend the shrimp teriyaki. \n\nUsually at the end of the meal, they bring out oranges and pineapple, which is a nice touch. \n\nI have not been there for dinner, only lunch since they have great deals. Go between 11:30 am - 3:30 pm since that is when the lunch specials are.",

We started with the house salad with vinegrette on the side & feta cheese - delish then dominican longanisa, tostones & chimichuri sauce - amazing! Hubby enjoyed his sangria but my drink was to citrus for me - think it was the huming bird - not sure. After 5 hubby asked for the mofongo which comes with shrimp but he asked to substitue for beef barbacoa instead and it was very good.  I had the bonelss short rib and this was so soft and tender, hubby kept sticking his fork into my plate! Came with 3 different potatoes - 1 mashed - YUM.  Then if things couldn't get any better we had the plantain bake as dessert and it was the best thing on earth.  Consistency of apple pie but made with sweet plaintains instead.  I'm taking mom there this week.  Hubby complained it was a bit pricey - i never care about paying for good food & ambience.  Loved the spanish music playing too!!!  Who cares about outside - they have a few parking spots right in front for us early birds!",

I am hardly ever out by myself in the city, so I was nervous to go to a bar without friends, as I wasn't in the mood to fight off guys trying to talk to me. My uber driver recommended the Red Owl Tavern, so that is where I ended up that night. I was greeted by a very friendly hostess who I told I wanted to sit at the bar, as it seemed that was where all the activity was going on. As someone who pretty much never drinks, I had no idea what to order, and most times the bartender will look at me like I'm an idiot when I ask what they suggest I would like. This was not the case this time, the bartender was one of the nicest and most friendly guys I had ever met (and pretty handsome too). He was able to explain all the drinks on the menu and suggest the ones he thought I would like the most. He told me his name was Mirek, and if I was in the area more, I would definitely come back. Food was a high price, but well worth it. Thank you for the wonderful service!!",

Several types of meats, a bit of cheese and a scant dolep of red gravy on a dough pie that literally puffed up around the outside into an airy, slightly burnt crust.\nThe Owner, Mr. Scott Volpi was interacting with the customers as well as his staff.  He is a very personable young man! We wish him well!\nAs I told him on the way out, my only regret is that we didn't come up from SE AZ sooner; we've been missing A LOT!",

    "text": "So we were strolling down Frenchman Street, which already is a more local hangout, and decided to just walk around the surrounding Marigny neighborhood (which was absolutely beautiful.) I am soooo glad that we did, because we happened across Horn's. The delicious smell coming out the door drew us in straight away. We were greeted by very friendly staff, and quickly seated on the patio overlooking the beautiful homes in the neighborhood. I was glad to see that their menu had a very nice selection of different foods. I ended up with the \"Jewish coonass,\" which was absolutely AMAZING. The dish consisted of two potato latkes piled high with crawfish etoufee, each topped with a fried egg. I am craving it now!!!  My partner had the stuffed bell pepper and it was amazing as well. Very good prices, and also a good selection of craft cocktails as well. The next time we are in New Orleans (which I hope is soon) we will definitely be here again!!!",

Our server was a young girl and I believe she was training someone so we got extra special attention, which was nice! The salad was fresh and served on frozen plates along with their fresh garlic bread. The crab legs came out fresh and hot and were served with mashed potatoes and an ear of corn. My only complaint is that after the initial order, they only bring out one crab claw at a time when you order more. This was a little disappointing since we were ordering all you can eat and definitely came to eat more than one at a time. The server was accommodating though and let us know that she would put in a new order each time she delivered our new plate so we never had to wait, which was nice. You can tell they don't mass cook the crab legs because they come out hot and steaming each time. The manager came over to check on us twice and ask how our experience was. Overall we had an enjoyable evening and will definitely return!",

The app did not give them my correct phone # and speaking to the great staff at the reception desk they told me sometimes yelp gets the addresses wrong for delivery so my advice is to type your phone # and address (if using delivery) into the comments box just so you get your food as fast as they intend to get it to you. \n\nThis is the best place for sushi in the area.

Place looks plain from the outside but it has a very clean, sharp look to it on the inside.\n\nWent here for an early Monday dinner (around 6:30pm) and only a few tables were occupied.  Monday's and Tuesday's are 50% off price of wine bottles! Great deal if you want to drink.  We received some really great bread with oil/vinaigrette for the start of our meal.  Could have ate another basket for sure.  Nice and fluffy with a bit of herbs on top.\n\nMy friend wasn't in the mood for wine so we just ordered entrees.  I had one of the specials for the night - lobster ravioli with a rose sauce ($16.95) and my friend had the coloured rotini pasta with spinach and switched the sauce to a rose sauce ($18.95).  Mine was delicious! Definitely home style, comfort Italian food at it's best.  Would definitely recommend if you are in the mood for Italian.

Our server was very friendly and polite, and checked in with us quite often. A couple walked in while we were dining, and the server recognized them and was chatting with them for quite some time - they definitely put in the effort to get to know their customers. The sushi, rolls in particular, was priced a little higher than your average sushi take-out, but definitely worth it. Their food is fresh, and their menu selection is great. Would definitely recommend this place to anyone who is looking for good quality sushi. Easily our new go-to spot.",

I really, really like their A2 sauce especially with my fries.  Variety of beers, as well as a full bar. And there is always a terrific special.  Not a really fancy place but a little more upscale casual, comfortable and friendly service.  Their iced tea is good as well. Dessert we always have the lemon meringue,  delicious! We hear their rotisserie meat is terrific and what they are known for but we always get distracted from trying it by one of the other yummy choices,  some day soon though, we're going to have to try it!\nReasonable price for the great quality!",

It seems like a pretty exclusive team. However, once you order and wait (for a bit despite the slow Tuesday afternoon), the taste is so worth it. My table got the berry pancakes, the savory pancakes, and the grilled cheese with truffles. I also got the bacon, which came out in thick fat slices. Its probably the best bacon I ever had. \nThe mango smoothie rivaled a mango lassi, and everything was really delicious. \nuffle oil with aged cheddar grilled cheese. The grill cheese had the perfect savory combo of sweet n salty topped with an egg cooked just right.

Their grapefruit margarita was just right and the appetizers were right on. My favorite was the chicken bacon flatbread. The dough was fresh and the right consistency. The artichoke spinach dip was yummy too, but it was the chips that added the right touch. The hubby loved the calamari. To top it all off we received a loyalty card! Love that!",

On some Wednesdays they have wine tastings, so we were able to taste 5 different wines, mainly from the napa area, which were all excellent. We came with a group so we were also able to sample a ton of the food (we were told food is new within the last few weeks). We were blown away with the food! The orzo was Amazing, the flatbreads (fig and prosciutto, and mushroom and goat cheese) were also delicious. If you are interested in cheese pairings you can also do a platter of cheeses and italian meats to match with the wines. I'd highly recommend Cru.",

We have had pad Thai of course several times and it never disappoints. Ingredients were fresh and tangy. Crispy spring rolls are consistently good and not too doughy like most. Some of our favorite dishes are the crispy duck, BBQ squid, Meing cum and the Thai Salad. They will happily customize the curry to your heat tolerance level. Love this place for the food and service. The only thing that could make it better would be if they moved into Phoenixville downtown (but no doubt the parking would be much more challenging). Very easy and free parking in the shopping center where they are located.",

Her name was Tracey. She promptly delivered our drinks and let us know that Kristen would be taking over serving.    A very courteous gesture in my opinion.   Kristen was bubbly, friendly & very attentive.  \n\nNow for the food, the calamari fritta was delicious and lightly battered. This was tender and had a delicious flavor, served with a chunky flavorful marinara and juicy lemon wedges. The white pizza was delicious and mouthwatering. The crust crispy and the abundant flavor of the roasted garlic was a delight!

The thin crust is delicious; the sauce has that unique flavor I've been missing since moving to California; the topping choices are interesting and well prepared. Yesterday we went the slice route instead of ordering a whole pie because it gave us a chance to sample different pies. Ted really enjoyed the \"ranch\" slice and I thought the \"white\" cheese slice was delicious. We both love the everything pie We tried the meat-lovers but felt the pancetta made it a bit too salty. next up: the Florentine\n\nWe love this place!!! Mario is a pizza master chef IMHO!!! Ted thought I didn't like pizza because I rarely order it. Now he knows why: growing up with real NY pizza like this spoils you for eating the junk other places serve!!!\n\nThere are 3 pizza places with the same name but completely different owners and staff. When I read the negative reviews I can't believe they are at the same Slice of Life in New Port Richey off Embassy and Little Rd.

    "text": "What a wonderful find here in Newtown Pa. an authentic Indian restaurant with a charming cozy atmosphere and food to die for! We found it tucked in a little business center across from the Dunkin Donuts in Newtown PA. It is brand new and has taken over the same spot as Mamita's Latino had. It is worth seeking it out if you want to try real deal quality Indian food.\nWe were seated by a friendly gentleman and fresh papadam (which is a crispy wafer-like cracker/tortilla) and chutneys were brought to the table immediately.\n\nThe appetizers we had were Potato Samosas with a delicious tamarind chutney and a biting fresh cilantro chutney. Very crispy and filled with savory potatoes and peas in a crispy wrap.\nBoth were excellent. \n\nWe also had chili paneer, which really could be an entree. It was as hot as I wanted it to be but still you can tell a deft hand, who knows spices, created this dish (yummy beyond words!) and a we tried an interesting Panipuri. It was  a twist on the typical one you see on the Sunday buffets. This one was filled with crunchy toasted confetti and creamy avocado. Light and refreshing! Perhaps, you can tell my family loves appetizers and it would have been plenty of food if we stopped there but since it was so good we couldn't help but try as many things as our chubby tummies would hold.\n\nNorthern Indian food has always been my favorite style of Indian food but it can be heavy.\nIt seems some restaurants think the more cream and butter the better but Guru's knows how to balance richness without killing all the flavors of the dish. So, being the hungry hungry hippos we are, here are our entrees:\nPalak Aloo- which is spicy, smooth spinach and potatoes,\nChili chicken- an Indo Chinese dish that was seasoned to mouth watering perfection ,Kind of like a General Tso's on steroids and spice. It is one of our favorites.\nPaneer Makhni- a homemade Indian cheese cube kind of  like a tasty tofu but better.in creamy tomato curried sauce .It's rich and creamy but not drowning in fat like so many other restaurants. The breads are fresh made to order. We found out this place is a BYOB so that certainly is a plus for our next visit. We had mango lassi and,chai tea this time but an Indian beer would be awesome with this meal.  \n\nWe finally surrendered after we tried the kheer which is Indian rice pudding .(Forget about the gloopy baby food the diners sell this is Awesome) .We can't wait to try the buffet that will be starting Thursday September 3rd 2015.",

We were seated within 10 minutes when the place looked very busy. It looks like they work hard at getting you seated as soon as possible. The staff was friendly and the atmosphere was nice. I ordered the Belgian waffle with strawberries and my husband ordered the Brunchies club which was so large, he brought half of it home. I love how they leave a carafe of coffee at the table. Our food was tasty and we will definitely go back soon. It's great have another 4 or 5-star restaurant in the area.",

Our first impression was \"Wow, this is a very nice restaurant.\" The restaurant is absolutely beautiful. The servers are professional and very attentive. I treated myself an order of single Tuscan Grilled Porkchop with Roasted Garden Vegetables while my friend went straight for the Shrimp Mediterranean. My porkchop was incredibly moist and tender. There was a thin layer of crunchy fat wrapping about the piece of meat, which actually gave it more flavor and texture. The portion was reasonable so that I did not feel like I was stuffing myself but actually celebrated the food. We, however, did not have the chance to try out their dessert collection. I personally do not think this was a bad thing since it would give us an excuse to come back here for another time and enjoy the food.",

She even came out with fried cheese cake with a candle and started singing happy birthday at the end!\n\nThe birthday girl had the Bloomingdale Roll $13 which was spicy tuna, spicy salmon, spicy kani, spicy yellowtail and spicy shrimp avocado with longan on top. It was good but I'm not really a fan of the pink seaweed thing. I asked the waitress if they could write \"Happy Birthday\" on her plate and they did. They even added a little tree and made it look like a little island!\n\nMy other friend ordered the Cancer Roll $15 which was spicy tuna, seaweed, salad, eel, masago, soft shell crab. They drew a bird on her plate! It was so cute!\n\nI had the M16 Roll (sounds like a gun) $13 - eel tempura with spicy tuna rolled in black and red tobiko (fish eggs). It was yummy!

It's open from 11-3 only but call ahead and they'll hook you up with what you want! The Orzo salad is so delicious and the Prosciutto/Fig Tartine is outstanding. The soups are incredible as well. All the selections I've had are very flavorful and have been thoughtfully created to compliment one another. Get yourself there and check it!!",

    "text": "Rick Lewis is pretty much Mark McGwire. The guy just keeps hitting home runs when he opens restaurants. First Southern and now Grace Meat + Three. By the way, I do realize McGwire took steroids but who didn't back then? It was the thing to do in the 90s! As was the Macarena. What a time to be alive!\n\nI met my brother here for a \"cheat day\" meal. I couldn't think of a better place to ruin all my hard work in the gym and in the kitchen than at this new southern cuisine hot spot in the Grove.\n\nIn order to get a taste of a few things we split a half hot chicken and half rack of BBQ pork ribs.  Our four sides: cornbread, Mac and cheese, fried potatoes, and greens.\n\nReview:\nHot chicken: unlike Lewis' other hot chicken place, Southern, this place only has one heat level. It's certainly spicy but not too spicy. As expected, the chicken was big, juicy, and crispy. It got my nose running and eyes watering. Loved it! It's pretty much what you'd get at Southern from what I could tell. That's good!  \n\nBBQ Ribs: Not overly meaty but plenty filling and topped with an excellent, sweet glaze. More than likely I'll be going for the hot chicken over the ribs from now on but that's 100% because the hot chicken is the Mayor of Flavor Town.\n\nFried potatoes: ours were fresh out of the oven. Very crispy, thick, and good seasoning.\n\nMac and cheese: not bad. Could have been more cheesy(everything in the world could be more cheesy, though, in my opinion). The crumble on top added a nice flavor.\n\nCornbread: Tasty. Not too sweet. More bread than corn...whatever that means...wink wink.\n\nGreens: I'm not a greens guy but my brother liked it.\n\nConclusion paragraph:\nI had high expectations going in. Especially since I've limited my carbs and calories for the last two weeks. A bad cheat meal would have = a sad Scott. However, I was very pleased with everything and highly recommend this to anyone looking to get some belt busting southern food!",

    "text": "Before I even start this review I have to thank my fellow yelpers. There is no way I, or anyone for that matter, would have found this place if it weren't for someone just like you doing a review. Thanks guys!\n\nTucked away in a strip shopping center, albeit a cute shopping center, is this little non descript  restaurant. Since it was early in the day, we really weren't worried about a reservation although I did call as a just in case measure.\n\nWe wanted to sit outside since the back looks so pretty but were told it was closed but were led instead to an enclosed patio. Still nice. \n\nNicer still was when our server brought us bread, olive oil and a plate of marinated cannelloni beans with yellow and green squash. Wow! The squash were just a tad bland and needed salt but the beans were really flavorful.\n\nMy husband ordered the squash blossoms stuffed with ricotta and mozzarella cheese and I the beef carpaccio. Although I did miss capers on the beef and there was too much salad, both the dishes were really good.\n\nNow, our server gave us the list of specials and mentioned that two of them were served with langostines. I had seen these on one of the cooking shows but didn't know exactly what they were. My husband ordered the Carbonarra and I got the Langostines with a blush sauce served with lump crab and fresh tomato.\n\nMy dish was pricey, yes it was but incredibly worth it. Imagine a cross between a lobster, a shrimp and butter. Really. The langostines simply melt in your mouth leaving happiness behind. The carbonarra with panchetta instead of bacon my husband ordered is the best I've ever ordered or even tried to make. \n\nAs I've said, we were really early so we got to watch the prep of the restaurant between the the lunch and the dinner service. It was truly a privilege. These servers went through the place with precision, dusting, wiping, washing and primping every aspect of the restaurant. \n\nIf you go, and you should, bring a nice bottle of wine, order the langostines and the tiramisu. Enjoy!",

They have a variety of non-dairy milk options and the cashier seemed very knowledgeable about the different types of coffee they offered and suggested a few of their house made syrups to add to my latte. I went with the almond maple syrup and oat milk, it tasted Amazing! I topped off my order with a vegan muffin that tasted just as good as the coffee. Thank you for offering vegan options!

They keep their pizzas as genuine and traditional as possible.\n\nYou can't go wrong with a plain pie, but if you'd like a change I'd recommend the Margherita, Trenton, or buffalo! \n\nAs far as non-pizza items I recommend: the Rambino (spinach salad) or chicken melt panini (also can be made as a wrap with fries.\n\nWorkers are friendly and fast. Other reviews have really put the girls down but they work hard to get the pick-out customers in and out and home to enjoy their food! \n\nFYI, I've learned that the tip jar goes to men, not the girls at the counter. Both deserve tips, just be aware of who you're tipping!\n\nThis place is worth a try- you'll be hooked!\n\nNOTE: other Spatola's (there's about 10) were previously owned by these owners but have been sold. Besides the name, they are no long we affiliated with this location. Their Chalfont location is their only one, and this one has the most genuine taste of Sicily.",

We received the Fiesta cake by accident, and the server was kind enough to allow us to keep both slices of cake. The cookie was crispy on the outside but chewy on the inside. Could've used a little bit more sea salt but the chocolate chips were so fudgey and rich so I didn't have much to complain about. The campfire cake was delicious. The cake is moist and fluffy, while the whipped cream is chocolatey. Reminded me of the days I'd come back home from school on a winter day and I'd rip one of those Swiss Miss packets open into warm milk. The buttercream is made with Swiss Miss by the way! The Fiesta cake is a bit more dense, with a cream cheese frosting. Definitely an enjoyable experience. The shop itself is very cute and beautiful. I'll be returning... very soon!",

I strongly suggest getting one of their membership cards, which offers rewards for frequenting the establishment (such as a $50 gift card). \n\nTria has a great happy hour (5-7) which offers different lists of wine, beer, and cheese at discounted prices. My friends and I always ordered food from there menu and we loved EVERYTHING! I especially love the asparagus salad with white beans, beets with feta cheese, and their lavender pistachio honey drizzled bruschetta.  Their lemon square dessert is amazing as well!   Their menu does change seasonally throughout the year, which I think is nice.  Their variety of wine, beer, and food offers guests a chance to try new items every visit.\n\nYou cannot get reservations at Tria, but they have a decent turn over for smaller groups.

There was seating both outside and inside, but we decided to sit indoors since it was a bit windy and hot outside since we were literally in the ocean on the pier.\n\nMy boyfriend got us the shrimp cocktail salad and the 4lb (maybe it was 6lbs lolz) crab to share that was the special of the day. But out waiter had informed us that they ran out of the specific crab we wanted, but gave us two different crabs that was equivalent to the weight of the crab that we missed out on.\n\nOnce our food arrived, we dug right in. Everything tasted, so delicious and fresh. We finished off everything that we ordered and made sure not to leave any sort of crab meat morsel behind. The shrimp salad was surprisingly good. It was light and the shrimps were juicy. The crabs had their own different flavors and came with really crispy onion rings on the side and melted butter. \n\nI definitely will come back here again cause pricey as it was we definitely got our monies worth!",

Every time I go I am never disappointed with their beer selection, and the food menu seems to constantly be improving. If you can't find a beer that you like at WOB, I feel like it is time to move on from the beer world and go to wine bars instead because this place is fantastic. When I go I usually get a new draught beer on tap and then a bottled beer from Evil Twin Brewing Company. Jeppe Jarnit-Bjergs\u00f8 is the founder of Evil Twin Brewing Company. He has a cool story - \" gypsy brewer\" who launched his beer in Denmark, but then used friends brew rooms in ten places around the world to produce his beer. He is finally opening his first stand alone brewery in Queens, NY this coming spring. I feel like it is a little harder to find his beers, but not at World of Beer! As for the food, I have tried their wings, tacos, chicken sliders, cheese board, and most recently their fried pickles. All of the food items were quite tasty, and if you go during happy hour a lot of the appetizer items are discounted to $5 dollars a piece. Next time I am in Exton, I will be capping off my day here!",

Lots of crispy bacon, fresh tomato, and a yummy avocado aioli spread served with a side of fresh strawberries -- a perfect summer lunch. \n\nHenry's has a great atmosphere and is friendly to work-at-homers like me who need to get out of the house occasionally. You'll see a mix of people on laptops plus locals hanging out or having meetings. Friendly and spunky staff will remember your order and serve it up with a smile (or some good-natured ribbing).\n\nDon't miss Henry's on East!",

One of my favorite things for brunch is the crab cake Benedict. YUM. A few nights ago we went for dinner and I had the shrimp fra diavolo (or something like that). It had a delicious rosa cream sauce that packed the perfect amount of heat and shrimp that were cooked just right. No matter when we go we always order the fried mozzarella appetizer. It comes with one of the best marinara dipping sauces I've ever had. \n\nThe service is always fantastic as well.",

    "text": "Great concept, perfect atmosphere, even better food.\n\nWhat looks like a small corner store in Bywater opens up to a large courtyard in back with tables and torches strewn about seemingly haphazardly, like a friend might put together for a party on a Saturday night. \n\nA stage in back houses an assortment of bands, and from my singular experience I will say the quality of music is exceptional. We saw a great jazz trio followed by a funk trio of organ/guitar/drums that was so good... Shout out to the drummer who had my jaw on the table all night. So tight and sublime. \n\nTo get to the courtyard you pass through the corner store full of wine, find a bottle that suits you, maybe some cheese or charcuterie, then head out back to find a table and park for a bit.\n\nThe food was better than either of our meals the previous two nights, and at half the price. \n\nI had pork shoulder (in a broth born for sopping with good French bread), but honestly the chicken confit was the best plate of food I've tasted in a long time. \n\nOlive oil cake is worth a taste for dessert.\n\nLittle cold this week so the heaters were out, which was great, but I'm looking forward to a warm sultry night here sometime in the near future!",

Because I have eaten at Nabin's other Restaurants and have found his Chef skills to be superior, I anxiously awaited the Grand Opening.\nI recently attended Lunch Buffet with family. One member from New York stated, \"This is THE BEST Indian food I have ever had. And I have been to the best of them in New York\".\nOn this day, the food was better than ever. I was told they hired an additional cook.\nI had my Saag made without cream - the yummiest!\nAnd the Chai was exceptional.\nThere are more decorations. It is quite a beautiful place to be proud to take a group to eat.\nA big bronze Dakini greats you (I think it's a Dakini - a divine being of nature)\nI always love the Yellow Dal, Kulcha Bread, their fragrant Rice and so much more.\nEveryone is friendly and inviting.\nService is stellar - felt like a Queen with many waitstaff stopping by.\nThank you Nirvana - so aptly named!",

    "text": "FAN-TAS-TIC. From the ambiance to the staff to the FOOD, the experience was definitely worthwhile.  Our waiter was very courteous and we felt very welcomed the instant we stepped into the restaurant. There was about 8 of us which is probably the ideal number (8-10) comfortably sat around a round table. \nThey started with the hand washing and distribution of towels (yeah we were dressed all nicely which is fine, but keep in mind that your pants might get dirty). The cucumber and eggplant portion (it tasted like beef lol) was delicious, the chicken/egg plate was odd but we liked the flaky stuff as we all choked on the powdered sugar on top haha Then came the meats; we had the mild chicken with olives where, its true, the meat just fell right off the bones, and we had half of the beef kebabs and half of the lamb. The lamb was dry, definitely go with the beef kebabs. The couscous was ok, not really great but it probably would have been better to give that before the meat courses because we were getting stuffed. The desserts were fabulous; incredibly fresh fruit,  yummy baklava, and tasty mint tea. The courses were nicely paced and we were finished dinner in a little over 2 hours. All of this for $25 a person! And if you get the wine carafe ($12), get the white wine. \nNow for those of you interested in the belly dancer, our dancer was not that great. She seemed nice but we weren't really into it. However, the other incredibly drunk parties were (luckily we only had to deal with them for a few courses).\nSo gather round some friends, pick a date, and fumble through your way to Marrakesh into the alley and the very dimly lit rooms. You'll like what you find.",

New York has incredible middle eastern food, but this is, bar none, the best I've ever had in my life. Best chicken schwarma, best seasoned falafel, best (and most massive) vegetarian platters. The portions are huge, and did I mention delicious? Two very hungry people could make a great meal out of one serving.\nI've had the garlic chicken- shredded white meat with many optional sauces, making each bite a different taste experience, as well as the vegetarian platter, which was so gigantic that my very hungry friend and I still had two containers to take home. Everything tasted fresh and delicious.\nThe service is also five stars. Smiley and Mrs. Smiley go out of their way to make sure you are charmed and satisfied, whether that's sending over free baklava or extra smoothies so that everyone can have a try. \nI'm happy to say I'm a Smiley's regular, and will sing their praises to whoever will listen.",

I live in California where there are plenty of Fresh Mex restaurants, but Buena Onda has the best tasting fish tacos hands down. The fish is lightly grilled, moist and seasoned just right wrapped in fresh tortillas, garnished with pickled relish and small thin slices of avocado. The tacos are served in a taco holder which makes it easier to pick up and relish every bite! The restaurant itself is bright and clean, quick service and friendly staff.

    "text": "In my mind, a line out the door and sometimes filling out into the parking lot can never be a bad thing. This line situation has ALWAYS been the case, and I've been coming here since I was little girl when trips home from grandmas on I-70 meant taking a detour off the interstate to Gray Brothers Cafeteria. The lines may be long, but the place is huge, there are at least 3 very large rooms for dining, so don't worry about not being able to get a seat. The wait staff is friendly and will help carry your trays, bring you drink refills, etc. \n\nGray's certainly has the best tasting cafeteria food I've ever had. If I didn't go through the line looking at all the options myself, I would have thought someone's grandma or mom was back there serving up all of these home cooking favorites. \n\nObviously, the strawberry pie is iconic. It is good, a little sweet and syrupy for me. I like the sugar cream pie better personally. \n\nAnd again, obviously, the fried chicken is also iconic. But that is finger licking good. Sometimes I opt for the chicken strips because I find them easier to eat - but all of their chicken is tasty. As are all of their meat and fish entrees I've tried. \n\nNow for the sides. THE SIDES. I am a mac n cheese expert, let me tell you, and this is the BEST I'VE EVER HAD. Perfection. I wish I could get that for my entree. \n\nThe mashed potatoes and gravy are great, the green beans are great, the corn is great, heck, even the broccoli is great.\n\nIf I haven't convinced you to come here by now, I'm not sure if it will ever happen. But if your mouth is watering even a little bit after reading this review, I highly suggest making your way down to Mooresville, Indiana and heading to Gray's. It is worth the drive. Promise.",

I tried to order as much cooked fish sushi as possible, so that meant crab, lobster, and smoked salmon. I did get a little spicy tuna in there too but only because the rest of the group loved it. Long story short, I loved every bite, the lobster rolls were delicious, and we got some firecracker roll with lobster, spicy tuna, and some crunchy stuff (ginger?) on top of it... that was the best sushi flavor/texture combination i have ever had!\n\nAgain...I didn't pay for the meal, so that may have influenced my rating a little.

The portions for the main course that I got seemed small - but if you get an appetizer either to share or on your own, an average person should be in good shape. \n\nFor the table we got an order of the Truffle Rosemary Parmesan French Fries, which were very flavorful. It had a nice earthy truffle taste, balanced with the saltiness of the Parmesan, and rounded out with the rosemary. \n\nMain course was the Bacon Wrapped shrimp with Stone ground Grits. This was exceptional - and was probably the best 'shrimp n' grits' i've had in NOLA. Shrimp was perfectly cooked, with a crisp piece of bacon wrapped around it. It stayed crispy even on top of the moist, decadent, and flavorful cheese grits.",

I recommend the steak bites with gorgonzola cheese dip appetizer and the cannelloni with rose sauce. I usually prefer the lounge to the restaurant because it has a great laid-back vibe, awesome music, excellent service and is generally not too busy. Oh! And the lounge also has free popcorn and board games every night. The Jasper Ave location pales in comparison, so make sure to go to the South one. Also, it's never a bad idea to go for the Sunday pasta special that's a giant family style plate of 5 different pastas for about $13 per person (of parties of 2 or more).

I visited my sister in LA and she sprung on the great surprise that we were headin' to Santa Barbara for the weekend.  \n\nThe Shellfish Company sits on the end of the Stern's Warf which is one of the longest deep-water pier between Los Angeles and San Francisco.  From the outside you can see the tanks of fresh Abalone, Dungeness Crab, and the infamous Spider Crab.  You must make a reservation here and be prepared to wait a bit.  The inside is a classic, you are here for the food not the ambiance,  tavern style seafood bar with outside seating (be careful it can get windy). My sister and I sat at the bar.  The bar and overall inside seating is pretty tightly compacted which may bother some.   We, however, were in seafood heaven and talked it up with the staff/bartenders who were really awesome; enjoying life kinda people - they tipped it to the official 5 star review. \n\nWe started with the Abalone for an appetizer which was really good; perfectly seasoned and cooked. I also had to try the chowder - awesome, but Maine's is better!   They have a decent array of beers on tap and I chose a local brew.  For dinner we split the Spider Crab cause we ain't scared of shh... ok, maybe I was a little....it was huge!!!  The dinner combo, I believe, came with choice of soup or salad.  Splitting the crab was definitely enough for two people. I recall my sister throwing in the towel and me testing my manhood.  My one critique is that I thought the Spider Crab was over cooked.  It by no means ruined the meal and may not be noticed by most but I know my seafood. \n\nOverall one of the best experiences ever.  If you go to Santa Barbra you MUST go here!",

Another reviewer called the location \"Dogtownish\" but it is actually Richmond Heights-ish, meaning that it is really truly in Richmond Heights. It is right off of 64 on Big Bend, so if you're cruising through town hop off and try it! Also, if you are dining at any of the Maplewood establishments on Manchester, Mr. Wizard's is a pretty easy walk from there. \n\nNow to the good stuff: I can't vouch for all menu offerings, because my go-to is a concrete with butterscotch and pecans. Delicious! My bf likes the malts.\n\nI can't settle the Mr. Wizard's v. Ted Drewes argument because I am new to town, but it is very hard to imagine that Drewes serves anything better.",

    "text": "I created this yelp account just so I could write a review for this place. So I was on my way through Nashville while on a trip to Texas from Maine with my girlfriend and decided to stay in Nashville for the night. We stopped by this restaurant and started off with some drinks which were both fantastic beers that were recommended by our waitress. We then ordered our burgers, I ordered the chili-chili bang bang and the Benton's bacon mac and cheese and my girlfriend got the buy the farm and truffle tots. Now here's where things got interesting and the reason why this place gets a 5 instead of 4 from me...... I got my food (which was cooked perfectly and had plenty of flavor) and my girlfriend took a bite into her burger and pulled out what appeared to be plastic from it. We politely told our waitress and she took the burger right back and had them make a new one for us. The manager (I believe, it may have been the chef) comes out and apologized and you could tell he was very remorseful and that this is not a regular occurrence. He explained that the wax surrounding the cheese must not have come off and fixed the burger immediately and triple checked everything again. He even came out with two extra sides of tots and quickly brought her burger back. Then to top off this already incredibly generous gesture, they comped her entire meal for us (which they didn't have to do, for after that level of service I would've been glad to pay full price). We made sure that we still tipped over 20% of the original price of the meal before some of the food was comped for the excellent service. I went in to try and shake that gentleman's hand but he had gone out back right as I was leaving. I would recommend this place to anyone of my friends who are traveling to Nashville, and I will definitely make a repeat trip the next time I'm here",

After hear one raving review after another, I said enough is enough and took a walk over...and I was not disappointed (except for one minor factor).\n\nUpon walking in the women behind the counter were so sweet and patient. I told them it was my first time and they were more than happy to work with me while I surveyed the entire menu. Eventually I ended up ordering for my dad and I two chicken sandwiches and two cinnamon sugar \"fresh and hot\" donuts, and a cold brew coffee for myself. This is where the one bad part of my experience comes in: the price. These five items came to $21.60, which I believe is quite expensive.\n\nThe cold brew coffee is soooo good. I feel like most places try to nail it down and can never get it right, but Federal Donuts sure did! It had a very robust coffee flavor.\n\nThe chicken sandwich was absolutely delicious; the chicken was juicy with a crispy battered outside, the seasoning was nice and balanced, the touch of sauce was just right, and the potato bun was very fresh.\n\nThe cinnamon sugar donut...just, wow. These people don't lie when they say it's \"hot and fresh.\" It was warm, soft, moist, and loaded with cinnamon sugar. I could easily eat 3-4 of those things in one sitting. At $1.50 a piece you are paying a premium for quality. \n\nDespite the price being a little high, I will definitely be back to try their other varieties of donuts and chicken. 10/10 (or 5/5, according to Yelp).",

Hasan made sure my husband not only enjoys the Lassi but also catered his sore throat with a medicinal combination. It tasted amazing.\nI wanted a spicy Chaat... Its been ages I had such a perfect chaat... Spice, taste and innovation all came together. Must say, have never had such a chaat even in India. \nI wish we had one in Milwaukee.

    "text": "My wife and I have a specific location we go to in VA.  Whenever we \"cheat\" on them, we are always disappointed.  However, on our recent trip to Tampa, our host said this place was good from what she heard.  After looking at the reviews from a few spots in the area, we decided to give it a try for my wife's birthday.  \n\nOne thing I will say is that this place is expensive!  So is our spot in VA.  However, we felt we got our monies worth here.  We waited about 10min or so and we were seated (it was a Thursday night).  Our waiter was Lou.  From the time we sat down to the time we paid, he kept us laughing.  I forgot our chef's name but he was awesome as well.  \n\nThe food was great!  I didn't expect the noodles which was a plus.  I also ordered Supreme California Rolls and my friend ordered something else.  Both were up to par with my standards.  \n\nFor the main meal, the steak, chicken and shrimp was cooked perfect!  The yum yum sauce I'm used to isn't as watery but it was still good.  \n\nI did order 2 Sake Bombs and when asked if I ever done one, I said I sure have back home in VA.  Lou said we haven't done one FL style..lol.  Lou then got everyone together to chant along (2 tables) as we did the Sake bomb.  We made a mess but Lou was there with replacement napkins.  He also got everyone at the table to sing happy birthday to my wife which was cool.  Then again the people at our table were cool to begin with.\n\nOverall, I loved this place.  It was pricey but well worth it in my books.  If you ever go, ask for Lou as your waiter.  You WILL NOT be disappointed with him.",

EVERYTHING on their menu is so good and filling! My favorites are veggie burger wrap which is $5 (instead of veggie burger, it'll be in a tortilla, but somehow 10x better) and chicken satay tacos (2 for $7). Their thai bubble tea is extremely tasty too! \n\nBeware of the long lines though (try to avoid going anytime from 11:45-12:30, if you do, expect a long wait, and no you cannot call ahead and order). If you're a Drexel student, go in between class, guaranteed no line! \n\nCASH ONLY",

    "text": "First time venturing out to Brewerytown! \n\nAnyways, the burgers were so good! You can get them medium rare or to other likings. The buns were that soft potato roll quality like shake shack's. The size is bigger &thicker than shake shack but smaller/thinner than regular steakhouse burgers. \nWhat made the burgers so good were flavors! \nI got umami burger which has sauce based on korean ssam-jang (miso/chili pepper paste) and topped with mushrooms and shredded lettuce+cucumber. I wasnt sure how the sauce will play with the burger but boy did that combo work! Lk the name, lot of umami from the sauce with a nice refreshing balance from the veggies. I've never had a burger taste like this before. \nBf got butcher burger which had onion, tomato, and horseradish sauce. The sauce in there was also awesome, giving the greasy burg an extra kick. \n\nService was quick and friendly. Not a lot of space for a large group though. \n\nOh and it's byob? We picked up some beer from rybrew across the street while waiting for the burgers. There seem to be other cool new spots around here like crime and punishment brewery, and aforementioned rybrew, which is somewhat like foodery.",

Bacchanal is a fun, memorable, tasty way to spend a day.",

    "text": "We had to go to Costco to buy a new TV. We wanted to avoid driving 465 (coming from Bloomington) so we decided to go to this location instead of Castleton. We were sort of dreading going on a Saturday afternoon, thinking it would be a madhouse from the parking lot to the check out line. Boy, were we wrong. The Greenwood Costco is the most mellow, low key, Costco I have ever visited. \n\nSeriously, we were blown away. Plenty of parking. Not crowded. Nice people working there. Lines not too long at check out. Clean! \n\nI have been to Costco locations from California to Indiana and this is my new go-to location. Have been visiting the Costco in Castleton but this location is so much nicer. (only wish that there was a Trader Joe's nearby)\n\nAnother cool thing, this location has so much more Indian food than any other Costco I have been to. I assume it's due to a larger population of Indian people in the area. \n\nWe asked the cashier why it was so mellow there and she said \"I think it's because we are so new\" but honestly, I would think that would be a reason for them to be crazy busy there. Regardless of the reason, it was the best Costco experience I have ever had.",

Bossman got the porkchop that was about 4 inches thick (no kidding) and I got the bourbon chicken. Both were excellent, and the pork wasn't tough, which was surprising Considering how big those chops were. \n\nA few things about Alton:\n\nEast Alton is a rusty old industry town, a place in its hay day made some awesome stuff. They still have Winchester making ammunition their and Olin Brass cranking out precision copper and brass alloys. unfortunately, my reason to go  there was to decommission some research equipment at the olin Brass Metals research Lab. Yeah, the bean counters shut down the research department. Stupid. I wonder what the heck is going to keep this country going in the future. \n\nAlso, Alton was home to the worlds tallest man.",

Frenchman Street is where the music is. I highly recommend Three Muses, which is a gastropub on the street. The food is incredible. The mac and cheese is amazing. The cheese it uses is great and the dish comes out sizzling hot. Once I started eating it, I could not stop till I finished it. I have the dish ranked as good as any mac and cheese I have tried. It is in a tie with Beechers (locations in New York and Seattle). The pork belly and \"Banh mi\" Gulf Fish Tacos are excellent. The lamb sliders and sweet potato gnocchi with Louisiana crab are very good too.\n\nOf course, Three Muses also has live jazz performances. The music is fantastic. I arrived at the gastropub ten minutes before it opened so I could get a seat at the bar immediately. It was a Sunday night and it still got busy for dinner in a hurry.\n\nIf you are visiting New Orleans and looking for recommendations, feel free to message me through Yelp and I can share my itinerary, which includes my Yelp reviews. The information for an electronic copy can also be found via my Yelp profile.",

Medium sized restaurant with two separate dining areas, good for large groups as you can reserve the entire back room.\n\nThe service is fantastic, even when we've shown up 20 minutes prior to closing time, the wait staff was still incredibly hospitable.  The margaritas they mix are great, which is saying something as I typically don't enjoy margaritas.  The food is delicious, and parking is very easy in the area.

    "text": "It was my 30th birthday, and Ralph's food was all that was on my mind.  I was thinking about veal since I knew that Italians really do make it best.  My husband and I stopped in to make a reservation for later that night and the host was very friendly and said \"We don't have anything open until 8:30pm\" but that was no problem for us and we just strolled around the surrounding area and stopped in a few shops while we were waiting.  At 8:15 we came back and our table was ready.  We sat down and were promptly served a nice cool glass of ice water.  My husband ordered an Italian Kiss which is some sort of espresso mixed drink.  He said it was out of this world.  A few minutes later we were served some delicious Italian bread and butter.  The bread was wonderful.  We then placed our order after looking over the menu.   We got the escargot as our appetizer.  This was absolutely wonderful!   My husband knew he wanted the Seafood Pescatore.  I decided to have the Veal Marsala and a side of meatballs.  We enjoyed our bread until our meals were brought out.  Now my Veal Marsala was hands down the best dinner out I have EVER had.  The veal was tender, the mushrooms were delicious, and the sauce,  well I think I had dreams about it that night.  My husband's dinner was also wonderful.  He used to prepare this himself and was surprised at how fresh and tender the mussels were .  He said he would get that again.  Now the meatballs are something you HAVE to get if you go to Ralph's!!!  These were nice and firm and the gravy was wonderful!  After all this good food we had to finish off the night with a cannoli.  My husband and I both ordered one and got one to go for my Dad.  Well those were crisp and the filling was the best i've ever had!    We will be returning to try more of their food.  Thank you Ralph's for making my 30th birthday incredible!",

You will not regret swinging by here.\n\nOne, the place is adorable. Upon first glance, one might note that it is reminiscent of an old industrial factory, but more like a factory that a group of rag-tag children made into a playhouse. Vibrant color, flowers, natural lights fun stair cases, decorative window panes... Really fun environment. \n\nService was a little slow, but considering they were packed to the brim because of our conference I let it slide. Waitress and hostess were really friendly. \n\nThis place has delicious and fresh burgers that come in such unique flavor combinations. I came back a second time just to try another one. First one I had was the Hog-Thai'ed which was a peanut glazed burger served with Thai rice noodles. SOOOOOO GOOOD. The one I had the next day was the American. (If you're worried about your cardiovascular health, please don't eat this one.) it is your classic bacon burger topped with melted cheese and fried Mac-n-cheese. Let's just say it changed me. Fries are amazing and paired perfectly with their unique sauces. Loved the sriracha mayo. A must try. \n\nThey also serve a million types of sodas including draft sodas, shakes (loved the cinnamon shake) as well as boozy shakes which are as wonderful wd they sound. \n\nIf you're looking for THE place in downtown St. Louis, please stop here.",

There is one guy behind the counter who spent a while asking me what sorts of food I liked and what spice I can handle.  I asked him to explain all of the ingredients and he went through them one by one.  It was very informative and interesting, and I appreciated his excitement and knowledge about the different flavors and combinations.\n\nWe eventually decided on the crazy chaat, a blend of a lot of chaats.  I say \"we\" decided because he took my feedback - and perhaps my mood - into account.  I would venture to say the chaat was life-changing, but I'm also a huge fan of Indian food and chaat so count that as my bias.  In any event, because of the good vibes of this place and the ridiculously delicious food, I will surely be back.",

The service on Friday nights is fantastic.  \n\nOver the years, the cooking has improved and is tastier than ever.  It's hard to get a seat, so plan on waiting 30 minutes on a busy night - that being said, it's not long until you are seated and promptly given water and they have real candles here.  \n\nI always order the coconut soup (I order it with the tofu \"not fried\") and also the yellow curry with tofu - also not fried.  It lends a more delicate flavor to the already rich curry.  It is to die for - tastes like dessert.  It is served with rice.\n\nLast time I ordered the Pho - my goodness, the bowl is so huge and served with two sauces - hoisin and siracha.  Very good and filling - I would order it next time with more veggies (they are very good at helping you with special orders)\n\nThis is a BYOB and the prices can't be beat.  The menu keeps getting larger and I only wish I were closer to this place, as I would come here weekly for sure!",

For lunch, I had the Korean chicken sandwich. The fries were incredible; they must have been fried twice because they were super crisp.

It's a shame it's so small, as it makes it NOT a good choice for one of those Friday nights when you're like \"hey, why don't we...?\"  But, I'll forgive it for its smallness and move on to my fav things there.\nThe first time I ever went there like 5 years ago, I got the El Fino Wrap (it's this wrap with poached pears, gorgonzola cheese, toasted (i think) pecans and maybe some dried cranberries and onion?), and I almost passed away it was so amazing. To this day it's still my favorite thing there, and in my top 5 favorite foods on earth.  They don't have it on the dinner menu though, but you can always order it.  THAT is my ultimate fav.\nIn terms of soup - they are like soupmakers from the future.  Flavor combos I've never heard of warm ginormous bowls. The thai carrot soup makes me want to live in Thailand and become a carrot farmer.  They drizzle this creme fraiche on top and.... yeah.  You get it.  I also had this really awesome beet soup there... Which reminds me...\nThose crazy cooks at Blue Sage are like Masters of the Beet.  In fact, I was not aware of the degree at which I adore the beet until I'd seen it cooked/utilized about 5 different ways there. It's awesome.\nThen it's like, okay.... What else could they do to be Awesome McAwesometon?  Oh, they could have world-class desserts (w vegan options too) that make you want to setup a little cot and just live in their dining room.\nSo, obviously, I love this place.\nOne more thing - I prefer Blue Sage for lunch.  The options are there, it's cheaper, and they actually have more stuff I like on the lunch menu.\nDInner gets a little too grainy for me - literally.  I mean, I like quinoa, but it just doesn't wow me like the lunch stuff does.  Na mean?\nHearts out to the Sage.",

I have been to this location numerous times and I always have a good time with friends. The staff is always helpful when it comes to suggesting or teaching games. Any time I visit I usually leave with interest in a new game. \n\nThey have a good selection of snacks and beverages. They have quite a few sandwich options available. I recommend the Grilled Cheese. Table Top has a wide variety of beer and \"adult\" beverages. My wife usually gets an \"adult\" Slurpee while I usually stick with their craft beers or coffee. \n\nIt's a $5 admission fee but your time is unlimited so you can have a long game session with friends or short visits without guilt. You can usually get a table however I recommend making reservations so that your group is guaranteed a spot.  I have purchased quite a few games during my visit and I have not been disappointed with the prices.  Table Top Cafe also has games available on \"sale\" so I always keep an eye out for something interesting. \n\nYou can follow Table Top in Facbook, Twitter, and Instagram to hear about new games or events hosted at the cafe.",

It's also not that expensive - only about $10 /platter and it comes with two sides and cornbread... and if you don't like cornbread you can swap it for another side.

Whatever it is, it's got pretty great stuff!!! They have some beer flavors off the tap that I've never heard of before like \"Strawberry Shortcake Lager\" (which was what I tried). It was good, smelled like strawberries but tasted nothing like them. I also had a taste of their pear cider (which you can also get off tap) and the flavor mixed with the fizz was actually really good. Not the kind where it sort of hurts your throat. And with the ciders you won't feel the alcohol so much too so you wouldn't really know if you're starting to get tipsy or not. We had some food along with the beers too, we tried their pretzels with beer cheese dip. The pretzels were freshly made and the dip was exquisite!!!!! Really good salty side to pair for a great night with beers and conversations!",

Try the Buffalo Chicken nachos... the chicken is grilled, so no worries there. It is covered in cheese sauce and bleu cheese, too. I opted for extra buffalo sauce for more balance between hot and cheesy. I got the bacon cheeseburger with no bun, which was made from high quality sirloin. It was incredibly good!

    "text": "Chink's is probably not the BEST cheese steak I've ever eaten (and I have eaten THOUSANDS) but it is certainly in the top five of all time. \n\nIt is unique, somewhere between the Steve's (whole flat slice) and Jim's (chopped to death) presentation.  It works REALLY well, texture-wise.  Liscio's rolls were fresh and shiny, and the Wacky Wednesday deal of a large for six bucks was fortuitous. They usually have SOME kind of deal going though.. Meat was tasty and not gristly, the white American cheese melted like a dream (but short of the sauce that Steve's is.)  I got more meat than my son did, but both were acceptable portions.  Fried onions were 1/4 inch cubes, and caramelized beautifully.   Crinkle cut fries only get so good, but these were pipjng hot, and the Whiz that came on the side worked great on the sammy as well.  Lots of people on Yelp complained about the Whiz, but I could see it along with American as a great combo.Whiz is what Whiz is.\n\nPossibly the REAL best thing here is the 1949 vibe.  This place is a time capsule, where only the prices have changed (and pretty minimally at that) over five decades.  Everything (including real fountain sodas) are made to order. Milkshakes (the half and half was very popular)  were killer.   Waitstaff is attentive and friendly as you are likely to find on the East Coast.  The accents tell you you;re not in Kansas, but the hospitality is sans atty-tude.  It really does transport you to another era,,\n\nWe got there 12:30 and were lucky to snag the last open booth.  Full of regulars, with good reason.  Parking is not easy, but there are plenty of side streets, keeping the walk down to an easy block or so.\n\nIt was well-worth the 20 minute ride from the Main Line to make this pilgrimage, and it certainly won't be a \"one-and-done\" experience.  I usually find some reason or other to venture up route 1 every month or so, and when I do, this will certainly be a set waypoint on my GPS.",

The flavor combinations were not only creative, but sensibly ordered so that they complemented eachother, culminating in what felt like a gourmet meal from appetizer to dessert. The slightly odd feeling of sitting at a campus dining hall take away counter at Penn State quickly diminished as we realized we were getting the best seats and the best deal in the house.

My favorite is the goat cheese and pesto unfortunately for some reason they took that off the menu - which I'd like to go on record as saying I am upset about that.  My second favorite (which is still on the menu) is the Pistachio herbed Ricotta with Lavender Honey.  Tria's food is on the lighter side.  Usually when I go with someone else we load up on brushetta and cheese and split a panino.  One of my favorites is the Smoked Chicken panino.  During happy hour they have good beer specials.  If you don't feel like drinking while you there I recommend the passionberry iced tea.  It's bottomless - can't beat that.\n\nService:\nI've been here countless times and never had a problem with the service.  Everyone is nice and the food comes out quickly.\n\nAmbiance:\nIt depends which one you go to.  The one around 13th is bigger and has nice heated outside seating.  The one at 17th and sansom is smaller and since you can't make a reservation you have to get there before 5 to get a table.  The inside are both are basically the same.  Hardwood floors and a nice bar.  Candle at the table.  It can get a bit loud but other than that it's a nice place to eat.",

I have eaten there twice and verbally (and loudly) moaned in food pleasure over each meal!\n\nMeal One:\nWe Appz'd on the Assorted Breads.  Safe choice, but wonderful selections!\nMy dinner entree was the Amish Chicken. Very tender and juicy and the potato hash was wonderful!\n\nMeal Two:\nThe Appz was the Potted Pig, and the Flash Fried Brussels Sprouts.\nThe potted pig was plated creatively having to use a spoon to dive into the pork (texture of a country pate) and then add your toppings from the pickled selections of veggies they gave you either on a cracker or bread.  It was good.... BUT\n\nIf you REALLY want a surprising treat, get the Flash Fried Brussels Sprouts! Holy YUM. If Brussels Spouts could ever be considered candy.... you found it here.  They flash fry them and put them in a dish with onions, almonds and bacon! What a TREAT! \n\nI chose (after tasting my buddies last visit) the Pork Chop. And I remembered correctly, it was fantastic! The pork was perfectly seasoned and cooked and they put it over a bed of  sweet potatoes and topped it with apple slaw. So many flavors that melded together perfectly! and YES I ate my entire plate!\n\nDessert\nwe each got one and shared - table of four here-just for reference ;)\nWe got the S'mores pudding. They topped with semi burned marshmallows. Holy yum. and the pudding  was topped with candied pecans.\n\nI can not recall the name of the dessert our friends got, but we tried it and it was good as well! I do remember it had cinnamon ice cream.\n\nOne of the things I like about The Block is you can also purchase fresh butchered meats here!\n\nGreat place!",

It is ALOT of beets and ALOt of goat cheese, but oh so good!\n\nThe only catch to it is I feel like everything is a little over priced, but I will pay a little extra for great food and wonderful service :)",

Far, far better than Couch Tomato (no surprise there since this is a Mediterranean joint). Prices are fair, food is super fresh. Their hummus is silky with just a hint of lemon. Yes, carryout can take a little while but everything is made to order so I'm happy to wait or just call ahead. Do not miss this great little place!!",

    "text": "Dined here because a friend kept telling me that the BBQ shrimp was a must! We made a reservation and specifically told the receptionist that we will have a baby in a stroller. When arriving right on time for our 6:30 reservation on Friday 07/17/15 the hostess had this mean face. I informed her that we had a reservation and provided her the information. In a not so friendly tone she asked me if everyone was present. We informed her no, but they were on their way. The door to the restaurant is one of those spiral hotel lobby doors. My dad didn't know how to get the stroller inside. The male hostess walked to the door and was informing my father to go around. When I saw they were here, I walked up to the mean women and informed her my party was complete. She watched with an even uglier face on as my father walked in with the stroller. She ignored me as she was watching him and I repeated twice that my party was complete. She finally decided to talk to me and informed me that the stroller cannot go by our table. I then replied that I specifically informed the receptionist about the baby. At that moment the hostess raised her hand to my face to tell me to stop. I was shocked and wanted to hit her hand out of my face. However, being in a nice place I kept it in and just walked away. The male hostess sat us at a table that had booth seating. He pulled the table out for some of us to slide in and he walked away! So the rest of the party pushed the table back. I then was telling my family how shocked I am about our dinner experience starting the way it did. Mr. B's is a more upscale and nice restaurant and I didn't feel the southern hospitality at all! I had better service the night before at ACME! \n\nOur server Kevin & Renata then greeted us but being so heated I asked for the manager. EJ (Manager) came and I informed him of what happened. He offered to buy us our first round of drinks (which was very nice, but was not necessary). \n\nKevin & Renata were amazing! They turned our dinner completely around the recommended amazing dishes and treated us with respect. They both are great assets to Mr. B's restaurant. I dont leave 40% tips often, but when I do it's well deserved!\n\nWe ordered \nAppetizers \n1-1-1 soup\nSampler \nEntrees\n2 BBQ Shrimps (AMAZING)\nButter Truffle Filet (meat was good and very tender)\nCrawfish Ravioli (it was yummy but not as great as the other dishes)\nBacon wrapped Shrimp & Grits (delicious the grits were so soft and melted in your mouth)\nSoft shell crab (yummy perfectly cooked not to hard and dry)",

Ambiance is suitable for first date (not too dark) very open seating, casual dress OK. Music not to loud, you're able to carry on a conversion.  Also very comfortable choice for business or eating alone.  Service was excellent. Eddie my waiter, was very nice and helpful regarding the menu.  Also other waiters make sure you don't need anything. Very nice group effort in that regard. Nice outdoor seating available as well. This is a bit upscale so expect that to be reflected in prices.

Tasty and tender.\nWe also had oysters and cherrystone clams on the half shell to start. They were fresh and perfectly shucked. \nWine list is \"OK\". Typical steakhouse mark up but nice to see they also offer an \"under $50\" list of wines (of course very mediocre wines under $50)\nService is a \"B\" only because it took a long time for the waiter to give us the menu and later on took a while to bring us fresh horseradish.

    "text": "Had the best time at 3 muses! Made a reservation (highly recommended as this place is small and BUSY). When we got there, our table was almost ready so the hostess asked us to wait at the bar. We got a drink while we were waiting and the bartender happily transferred our tab to our table. They had a specialty house drink which my boyfriend and I both tried, it wasn't my taste but he loved it. There was a band playing that night, and our table was close by. The band was wonderful, played excellent jazz!\nThe food is served tapas style so it comes out as it's ready. We started with the fries, topped with feta cheese which were perfectly crispy and delicious. We got the bulgogi rice bowl which was flavorful but could have had a little more meat and vegetables to go with the rice. We were still hungry so we got an order of the mac & cheese and the bruschetta which were both phenomenal, I recommend getting each. After my house drink I had one of the beers, the fire ant, which was delicious. At the end of our meal the hostess came by to ask us if we minded moving to the sidebar table as they were behind on the reservations. It was a little offputting to be asked to move after spending $80 on a meal, but I understood and we happily moved. I read reviews that the servicehere was lacking and the bartenders were rude, but this was not our experience. The server was attentive, and the bartender was extremely friendly and helpful in ordering and was happy to transfer our tab for us. We will happily be back on our next visit to New Orleans!!",

    "text": "The Silver Spoon is the cutest freaking place ever.  All I can think about is how fantastic it's going to be when Spring/Summer happens and they open the doors and have seating out on the patio.  I will be bringing my OB, and planting my arse there for hours, that's for sure.\n\nI went there (thanks to Yelp!) a couple Saturdays ago for a late breakfast / early lunch.  I was paranoid there wouldn't be any tables, because that's how I am whenever I go somewhere with an above-average Yelp! rating, but the place was pretty empty at around 10:30 a.m., so we got a spot by the window.\n\nI was immediately charmed by the warm yellow walls and metallic ceiling tile-thingies (I'm so not interior-design-savvy), and the case of mysterious desserts and granola-y looking items.  I say mysteries because they didn't have any labels, nor did anyone mention them on any menu I saw.  Also charming was the four-top of older, nicely-coiffed ladies who were literally discussing various iterations of Bridge (apparently there's something called \"the _new_ bridge,\" which is played by the most foreward-thinking old ladies, but hated on by actual old ladies), and saying things like, \"Doris, you have *got* to come over for Mah Jong.\"\n\nThe menu was pretty awesome.  Saturday mornings, they put out the Mid-Day menu, which is a smattering of both breakfast and lunch items.  We had envisioned breakfast at first, but then they described the soups, so we changed it up.  My husband had the Silver Spoon Mushroom soup with cumin croutons and chili oil, which was amazingly rich and has to be a calorie-fest.  I got the turkey and escarole soup which was light, tasty, and more escarole-y than turkey-ish.  Then, my husband ordered this breakfast sandwich - homemade english muffin, bacon, caramelized onions, egg, and cheddar; I ordered the tuna sandwich, because it said it included pickled onions, and I was inspired to go there before 11:00 a.m., simply because they were going to let me. \n\nOur server, whose name I forget, was really welcoming, funny, and gorgeous.  We hung out for a while and had two ginormous cups of coffee, soaked up some rays in our window seat, and then picked up some menus to take home with us to pine over our next meal there.\n\nAny place with pretty people, sunshine, homemade english muffins, and local ingredients is a must in my book.  I'm going back for Sunday brunch tomorrow with a girlfriend, so hopefully my 5 star Yelpage won't catch on so soon that I have to wait in line!",

The setting is very low-key, the service a little on the slow side, but the food was outstanding -- certainly the shrimp and grits, and the banana's foster french toast.  I really enjoyed the combination juice -- thick, fresh and flavorful and definitely not from concentrate.\n\nThis was a gem from the lonely planet guide that lived up to expectations.\n\nCash only.",

No label is by FAR the best gluten free bakery--for bread, cookies, brownies...ANYTHING! Unfortunately I am on the far south side of the city and rarely make it to the north side, so I haven't been able to visit their store front until now. Ive had to use market wagon to get their breads and baked goods. I was so excited to finally be able to visit them. They were actually fairly busy when we went on a Saturday late afternoon. We got in and out quick and they were very helpful. I didn't see any bread out, but if you don't see any--be sure you ask! They had a ton in the back, they just keep it in the fridge! We purchased a LOT since we aren't able to make it up to Carmel much. We purchased a loaf of white bread, a cereal bar, peanut butter brownie, and nutter butter cookie sandwich. Everything was so great! My husband isn't gluten free, but he even loved everything he tried. I love no label and will always use them for my GF baked goods!",

I couldn't wait to try it here in, my new home. \n\nThey just opened 4 days ago and I highly do recommend giving this place a try if you want something new or different... The customer service is awesome and the lady that works there is very welcoming! She puts a smile on my face .  \n\nThey have sandwiches that are 12'  -- you can order just the sandwich or a combo that includes a fountain drink and a side of chips.\n\n[ Breakdown ]\nCombos (depending what you get): $4.95-$6.65\nSingle 12' sandwich: $3.00 - $4.95\nThey also sell variates of  spring rolls ( YUM )and have a section for Asian baked goods, smoothies, mocha freezes, and boba drinks!! \n\nMy order:\n- Grilled Beef Sandwich\n- Thai Tea w/ Boba\n- Spring Rolls \n= Deliciousness !!!! \n\n:] Hope you guys enjoy!",

This is the old Filo's, I spent many nights there having a few drinks,  listening and dancing to great music by the Worship crew, then walking home. \n\nWe decided to check this place out one Friday night when a friend from out of town was visiting. It was the perfect atmosphere and food in the downstairs lounge area. The music the dj was playing was great and funky, yet not too loud, so that we could still hold a conversation. The food was spectacular, we had the Ceviche de Callos con Sandia (watermelon and scallop ceviche), I wasn't sure what to expect, it was not like the typical ceviche I have had before, but it was delicious. We also had the Queso Fundido, one with chorizo and the other with mushrooms. They were both devine!\n\nThey also have a reverse happy hour special in the lounge: Thursday - Saturday, 10pm-12am. We had some tasty margaritas (although not the best I have had, but good enough for the price), and we were feeling really nice by the time we left there, not too full, it was the perfect amount of food, and we still had some $ in our pocket!\n\nI am definitely looking forward to going back to Xochitl.",

    "text": "HipCityVeg is different than the other vegan restaurants Philadelphia has to offer because it is based on great tasting fresh foods that are prepared fast. The menu was created by Marquis and Rich Landau, known for the upscale vegan restaurant, Vedge, and his previous endeavor, Horizon's restaurant. HipCityVeg is a fast food restaurant that serves burgers, wraps, salads, fries, and healthy drinks of many popular non-vegan dishes. I had to try two of these creations!\n\nLet's be honest... These sandwiches didn't last very long! The sandwiches had a lot of flavor and were fantastic! My favorite of the two was the Crispy HipCity Ranch, by a long shot! I liked the Buffalo Bella, but I thought that there would be more of a buffalo flavor. The Crispy HipCity Ranch tasted very much like it's non-vegan counterpart but more fresh and better prepared. I was most impressed by this sandwich! These sandwiches aren't cheap, but are worth the cash if you can spare it!\n\nThe restaurant is small. Small enough that I decided to take-out instead of waiting for someone at one of the 5 or so small tables to leave. I decided to just take my order home to eat, but the restaurant is close to Rittenhouse Square, a great park for picnicking or eating from a bench. The atmosphere at HipCityVeg is clean and refreshing. There is water available while you're there that is flavored with fresh fruits. I enjoyed some while I waited for my order to be prepared. There was a FourSquare deal available when I ordered here, and they accept LevelUp, an iPhone or Android app based payment service that has loyalty discounts.",

Lately going out we have been disappointed in the lack of service at so many restaurants. We went in with no expectations other than it looked good on yelp. When you initially look at the menu and the descriptions, it automatically creates a high expectation for the food. I can say that there were 0 disappointments the entire night! We received exceptional service and excellent food! We ordered the Simple Green Salad (far from simple, DELICIOUS LIGHT DRESSING), The Prince Edward Island Mussels (PERFECTLY cooked- all mussels opened and not chewy at all!), The Grilled Lamb Loin, and Seared Red Snapper Veracruz Style- BOTH so unique and flavorful! For Dessert we had the bread pudding (best I have ever had in my life!)  The waiter was extremely personable and the manager came over multiple times to ensure that we were having a great experience. I have respect for this establishment- there are two types of people in this world, people who work for the paycheck and people who work because they love and care about what they do. This staff works for their wonderful reputation.You can tell that the Red Owl Tavern's employees try to establish a relationships with their guests, rather than just trying to flip tables and want to be hospitable. The manager was in communication with us the entire night, ensuring we were having a great experience, as well as the waiter being prompt and attentive from the moment we sat down to when we left. They even gave us the dessert on the house! We will definitely be returning to the Red Owl Tavern next time in Philly.  HIGHLY recommend the Red Owl Tavern:)",

But the helpful staff was very knowledgeable about the different dishes and helped steer me in the right direction.  I went with the Pangoa, and it was DELISH!  It was picture perfect actually. Brown rice topped with fresh avacado, cilantro and cherry tomatoes, roasted corn, black beans, chicken and drizzled with a tangy \"spicy\" BBQ sauce (not so spicy for my tastebuds). I'm literally craving it as I type this....My friend got the Cobb salad and he couldn't stop raving about it. Everything was fresh, crisp, delicious and fast!  Also, a greats option for VEGANS, as the have tofu and falafels for all meal options. They also had a huge array of smoothies, a juice cleanse and breakfast options!!!

I never doubt the quality of the drink here, because the milk is really quite good. Also, some of the baristas here have some stunning latte art. Don't know what that is? You should ask one of them, they're all very experienced with what they're talking about. That's another great reason to come here - not only is there quality of service, but there's also friendliness. The baristas are always very kind, helpful, and informative about what it is they do. \n\nNot only is everything about the service great, the atmosphere is really cool too. I often find the art that they put up on their walls interesting and unique, and they change it out about once a month. The wood and white theme they have going on is very aesthetically pleasing, as well as nicely calming. \n\nThis is definitely one of my favorite places to go!",

Our server was very sweet and attentive. My friend and I ordered two orders of guacamole it was so yummy. She got the fish tacos and I got the shrimp, both were super tasty.

    "text": "It's all good when it starts with a biscuit! Yes, a large homemade cheddar drop biscuit brought to the table almost as soon as we sat down. Crispy at the edges, soft in the middle and so flavorful I did not even put any butter on it. \n\nThe brunch buffet is now an a la carte menu (except for special occasions, like Mother's Day, I think), which suited me just fine. Although I was curious about the savory offerings, I always have to try to the french toast when I go somewhere new. I was not disappointed. Thick slices of bread, perfectly cooked. The side order of bacon was generous and just crispy enough for me. \n\nMy dining companion had one of the benedicts - with smoked salmon. I had a bite and was impressed and I don't even like smoked salmon. Next time, I'll probably try the steak benedict. The regular one with shaved ham looked really good, too. Yes, I was ogling everyone's meals and they all looked wonderful.\n\nService was very friendly and attentive. There was a large group next to us and they seemed to handle that well, too. It is a comfortable, casual place. The perfect spot to start the day!",

My husband had the traditional Monday special in NOLA, red beans and rice. It was a generous bowlful that came with a side salad and bread. He added the grilled chicken, and got 3 large boneless pieces. I got a cup of gumbo and two a la carte sides. The gumbo was full of smoked sausage and tender chunks of chicken. My sides were smothered okra with shrimp and mac and cheese. The okra was yummy, although a bit skimpy on shrimp. The mac and cheese was outstanding. All of this, along with 2 iced teas was less that $30. I would definitely come back.",

Unfortunately, since it was late in the day some of the food items I wanted to order were sold out.

Our waitress was awesome, very welcoming and knowledgeable. I started off with the red pepper and gouda soup- just as wonderful as it sounds. Plenty of substance, not overly cheesy - very filling for a soup. Everyone else got one of the signature martini's. Everyone loved them, except two people with the same martini complained their drinks were dissimilar, and the waitress and bartender quickly corrected it, no problem. They have small plates there, which aren't my thing, but the one person in my party who got one liked it.  There was a fish special that looked and apparently tasted delicious. At the end, we each got desserts. \n\nThis is definitely a dessert bar- the portions were huge. I seriously thought they brought me two. I ordered a blondie, and received a large brownie AND a nice portion of ice cream- I was in heaven; just as delicious as it looked. \n\nGreat service, great food, great dessert. All I need. \n\nOn another note, I love that they had several areas, a bar, an area with tables by the window, and two sections with more personal seating, sofas and comfy chairs in the back. Really something for everyone, except for people expecting big burgers...",

    "text": "Marrakesh is a total package dining experience. Not only do you get to eat authentic Moroccan cuisine, you get to enjoy a cultural experience as well. \n\nYou may have walked past Marrakesh or the surrounding streets many times without even realizing it was there, like I had prior to this visit. It's nestled on Leithgow Street just a notch off of South Street. Forget South Street or even the rest of Philadelphia for that matter. You are about to step into a different world. To enter you must ring the doorbell on the side door. \n\nI felt more like I was going to a house, than a restaurant; especially with the shower located in the restroom on the second floor. During my entire visit, I never felt like I was at a restaurant. I felt comfortable and relaxed. Maybe eating with your hands with a towel on your lap has that effect. \n\nI found my group of fellow Yelpers in a cozy private room.  The room had four tables with booth seating along the outskirts of the room. Ottoman like chairs took up the rest of the space for the rest of us. With such a large group in not the largest of spaces, it got loud.\n\nOur meal started with customary hand-washing and we were even entertained twice with a belly dancer. After placing our order, the food kept flowing. The service was probably the most unobtrusive service I've ever had. As one dish was placed in front of us, another was seamlessly removed. I felt like royalty or at least someone enjoying a nice meal at someone's dinner party. The regular dining formalities I'm used to were thrown out the window, and it was fantastic! \n\nAs I'm sure you're aware, this $25 prix fixe menu has seven courses and you are welcome to BYOB. While it was a ton of food, I walked in the door absolutely starving and walked out not overly stuffed. I believe most people left absolutely full, so maybe the tip is to come in extremely hungry. Here's a little rundown of dining experience:\n\nCourse 1: Three-Salad Platter- The eggplant is phenomenal (and messy). Luckily you have some assistance from the pita to eat it. The cucumbers and bell peppers and carrots and cucumber were good, but the eggplant stole the show. \n\nCourse 2: The B'stella- As someone who doesn't normally love sweets but loves cinnamon, carbs and meat, this dish was a winner. This dish was dough filled with chicken, nuts, almonds, egg, peppers and onions. It was really hot at first, but once you cracked open the shell and let it cool down, it was easier to eat. I had some pita saved from the first course, so I found it easy to break off a piece and rest it on the pita while it cooled down. Truly a sweet-savory delight. \n\nCourse 3: Chicken- So here's where the choices began. You can either get chicken with lemon or spicy chicken. My group opted to get the spicy chicken with the cumin sauce on the side. The chicken was melt in your hands and then melt in your mouth good. The spicy sauce had a nice kick without being overly spicy to me. I still had some pita leftover so I did a little dipping with the sauce. \n\nCourse 4: Beef or Lamb- My table got a little creative here and asked for half portions of both the beef and lamb. The beef was served shish kebab style, and to be honest, not my favorite. It was a little well done, and I struggled a little to get it off the stick resulting in a pepper flying into my husband's wine glass. Sauvignon blanc tastes best with a little pepper anyways, right? The lamb was perfect. Even the non-lamb eaters thought it was delicious. It was tender and took on the flavor of the chick peas and onions without having an overwhelming lamb flavor. \n\nCourse 5: Couscous with veggies, chick peas and raisins- This was probably my least favorite dish from the main meal. It was a little blander than other couscous dishes I've tried in the past. I would have been disappointed if this was the only thing I ordered, but everything was a hit thus far in the evening. They did give us spoons at this point, so don't worry about eating the little grains with your hands.\n\nCourses 6 & 7: Dessert- I'm assuming the tea, fruit and pastries count as the sixth and seventh courses. At this point in the evening, my bottle of wine had been consumed and I wasn't counting the dishes, and am making this assumption while referencing the menu. I'm not a tea fan so I passed. The pastries were little crisp triangles that reminded me of baklava. The fruit came out frozen was a little hard to eat. I nibbled on a strawberry and took a banana for the road since the majority of the group passed on the fruit. Perhaps the fruit was customary, but I thought a little unnecessary. If it's part of the traditional meal then no harm, no foul.  \n\nTo sum it up, I had delicious food and hours of fun. It's an experience not to be missed in Philadelphia, especially if you go with an adventurous group of friends. While I couldn't imagine going to Marrakesh every Friday night, I can definitely pick a handful of occasions that would be a perfect fit.",

    "text": "So this is a delayed review because I forgot the name of this place, but figured it out via google street view.  I came here the day after the final day of the bar exam.  I was drained in every conceivable way, and had a hangover (thanks, AC) that could only be cured with the best, most gluttonous diner breakfast.  \n\nEverything my gf and I ordered was great.  I got basically every breakfast item on the menu (pancakes, eggs, hash browns, bacon, toast, sausage) and she got the cheesesteak.  Including a basket of great onion rings to start and 20% tip, it was only about $30, which is what I'm used to paying per head for a weekend brunch.  I'm crafting an excuse to travel over the bridge just to get some great homestyle diner food.",

    "text": "What a perfect way and meal to end our trip. \n\nOne of several restaurants owned by Chef John Besh In New Orleans.  From appetizer to entrees all the way to the end, dessert. \n\nFor our appetizer we split the Crab Meat Maison, served with fresh herbs, touch of horseradish and country bread croutons. \n\nMy choice of entree was the Jumbo Louisiana Shrimp over Roasted Jalape\u00f1o Cheese Grits and Andouille/green onion sausage.  I have never been a fan of grits before.  They have always been kind of bland, this one knocked my socks off. \n\nThe wife went with the Fresh Gulf Fish done Amandine Style.  It was lightly battered with buttermilk and flour, then fried and topped with Almonds in a brown butter sauce.  Served with new potatoes, green beans and roasted vegetables. \n\nPlease, try to save room for dessert.  Somehow we did. With two Cappuccinos we ordered Brendan's Bread Pudding. This is to die for! It is topped with Vanilla Bean Ice Cream and is accompanied by a buttered pecan sauce.  Also ordered the Chocolate Bourbon Pecan Tart, made with bittersweet chocolate and topped with Coconut Sorbet. \n\nPut this place on your bucket list of restaurants in NOLA. You won't be disappointed.",

    "text": "I was in town for a mini-family reunion.  The desk clerk at the Hampton Inn recommended this restaurant.  It was great.  We did have to wait about 30 minutes for a table.  But that is because it is so perfect, everyone wants to eat there and never leave.  The staff encourages this relaxed feeling, we never felt pressure to eat and run.  Instead they offered frequent top-offs for our coffee and water.  \nDana, our server, patiently explained the specials (a few times over) cause we couldn't make up our minds.  She made sure that the decaf crowd and non-decaf crowd were served correctly.  Also, she gave a more than accurate description of all of the menu items.  She was super welcoming and gracious even though the restaurant was busy.  \nThe food choices fit everyone's needs; savory or sweet, veggie or not.  Interesting combinations of old and new.  I had the Mac, egg whites, veggie sausage, spinach, etc.  It was very tasty and filling.  Also, appetizingly presented on the plate.  \nOthers in my party had variations of French toast and omelets.  Tasted the French toast and was in heaven.  All food arrived promptly and at once.  A request to cook a dish a little bit more was handled with ease.  If I had more room I would have had one of the pastries which looked delicious!\nThanks to all at the Prep & Pastry for making our family feel very specially treated and welcome.",

It's a cute, tiny spot that seems good for getting a few hours of work done or even just chilling. The crowd when I walked in was mixed, it included a man busy at his computer as well as a mom & her child enjoying breakfast. A couple others came in and out while I was ordering as well. \n\nI was really impressed with the beautifully crafted \"Lucky Goat\" latte I ordered...Dark chocolate, hazelnut, sea salt! It was delicious The barista was also patient and nice as I looked over what to order. I would definitely be back to try the other special drinks which all sounded amazing or try some of the fresh baked pastries. I'm also curious about the iced coffee.\n\nOne suggestion I'd have is for them to update their website! The website still lists fall specials and I know they have a couple of new drink specials every season! I'll be back soon to try more items off the menu!",

The menu is pretty tight with how you can get your steak here. There is no whiz (thank god) and the Pizza steak, Steak Hoagie, etc...where not listed (although they do serve hoagies, so maybe if asked nicely you could get one if that's your thing). Next thing to know is that they don't disguise their meat by chopping it up into fine little bits. This is sliced baby, and it is good. The real stand outs for me were the most amazing roll and the fantastic sauteed onions. Both components are easily the best I've yet to have in my travels around the city and made for a delicious gooey mess by the end of the roll.\n\nThe place itself has a great vibe. It is tiny and I can imagine fills up during those prime times. Its 5 cozy booths with individual jukeboxes surround a little soda fountain! The place was staffed today with 4 (including the cook) twenty-something girls who rocked the place. They were having fun and totally added to the uniqueness of the place.\n\nSteve's Prince of Steaks has been my favorite for a while, but Chink's has taken over thanks to the equally as good cheesesteak and the better than average atmosphere.",

Do yourself a favor and wake up early to be served within a reasonable time. \n\nIve had the Costa Rican and Banana Foster French Toast. Both were wonderful, but the french toast was OUT OF THIS WORLD. My god, the combination of the creamy, sweet flavors exploded like fireworks in my mouth. I didnt want to stop wating it was that good! If you want something sweet, please order this. The Costa Rican had all fresh ingredients, blended well together, left me pretty full. The rice was a little funny tasting, but I dont think I was use to how they make it. It wasnt that big of a deal mixed with everything else. I also tried some of my friend's biscuits and gravy. It was really good, even for something I normally would not order.

The wait staff was very attentive & professional, the food was exceptional & the timing the food came out was perfect. When I went in Sept they offered a restaurant week menu for $35, with a plethora of options to choose from. I started with their fresh crab app baked in a butter sauce with almonds. The crab was fresh & crisp & the lemon butter sauce was so fabulous, I had to dip some bread into it. For a main course I had their blackened & seasoned tuna served medium rare. It came in a delicious creamy pesto like sauce that complimented the tuna very well. For desert, I finished with their pecan pie with vanilla ice cream...easily the best pecan pie I have ever tasted, I could tell it was made at restaurant, absolutely phenomenal. I love that the chef recommends certain a wines with each dish too...the wine I had complimented the food well. \n\nI can see this place getting packed, so we went early.

The new venue is clean, organized, and very much resembles the layout of Allagash Brewery in Portland, Maine, for anyone that has been to that one.

Their beers are all unfiltered as opposed to other local craft breweries such as Yards and Flying Fish were are filtered.

Specializing in sandwiches, pizza, soups &salads, all fresh and taken up a notch.\n\nI chose Newk's Q sandwich which is sliced, flame broiled chicken, thick cut bacon and imported Swiss cheese served in a crispy semi-soft sub roll with their signature white BBQ sauce. Very delicious. Then I ordered  a bowl of corn and crab soup. Great flavor and a half Caesar salad which had fresh, crisp lettuce, toasted, seasoned croutons and plenty of Caesar dressing. All very flavorful. All that and an Imported bottle of Italian water for $10. I used one of the $5 off coupons direct mailed to my home. You order at a counter. You're given a number to display on your table and food is brought to you. \n\nManager and personnel very friendly and helpful. Nicely designed interior with an outside patio. Good quality entrees, lots of menu variety. They also have Mac n cheese and a dessert menu from Brownie's to home made cakes. Great format. I'll be back.",

The waitress we had was as good as ones we've had in previous locations: super cheerful, adorable, and prompt at checking on drinks and clearing away the plates.\n\nWe went today to check out Pliny the Younger, and while the ensuing scene was a little chaotic (maybe drink tickets would have been easier?) with two lines on either side of the store, they did the best they could, letting in 10 people at a time until the restaurant was filled. We were worried about our friend, who was running late and doesn't like beer, not being allowed in, but she had no problems after letting the host know we were waiting for her.\n\nThe food was also delicious. We all shared the Asturian Blue cheese which was nicely complimented by a blackberry sauce, I had the wild mushroom sandwich which had a lovely lemony flavor, my boyfriend had the three cheese sandwich (which I have ordered before and is quite good), and our friend had the truffled egg toast, which we have also tried before and is one of the standout starter items.\n\nAll in all, I have yet to be disappointed by an experience at a Tria in either location, even with these crazy extenuating circumstances!",

We got 2 brisket tacos and the daily feature, fried green tomatoes. The food took awhile to get to us, but when it did... holy crap. It was SO GOOD! The tacos were amazing, stuffed full of juicy shredded brisket, pico de gallo, beans, fried jalapenos... maybe more stuff but they were so flavorful and amazing I could barely stand it. And the fried green tomatoes were delicious as well! It ended up being way more food than we wanted for a small snack but we ate every single bite. Well worth it!

To start off, we ordered Vietnamese spring rolls which were delicious ! Light and flaky, with a wonderful side sauce. I ordered Beef with crunchy noodles as my entree. So good ! The beef was tender, green pepper and onion were cooked so that they weren't too soggy. Just right. And the noodles were crisp with added flavor from the curry sauce. Wonderful !! My sister ordered the Triple Delight , with shrimp, scallops and chicken. And she loved it ! ( She doesn't like spicy food, either. But said this was perfect.  Not spicy hot. We couldn't finish our platters. But found room for ice cream with fried bananas.  Perfect end to a great meal. The service was great, too. Food arrived quickly and the waiter and the mgr stopped by to ask us how everything was. They offer additional sauces on the table. One I fell in love with was Plum sauce. It's kind of like a sweet soy sauce. OMG.. So good. And the Owner was nice enough to give me a container to take some home, too ! Add this to your list of places to go. It's casual and quiet.  Nice place to eat and relax. Will definitely be back !",

I rank the dish as one of four French Toast dishes that are above all others. I do not even want to rank them 1, 2, 3, 4. Instead, I will rank them 1, 1a, 1b, 1c:\n\nTop 4 French Toasts:\n\n1. Blue Moon Caf\u00e9 in Baltimore (1621 Aliceanna St, Baltimore, MD 21231): The Cap'N Crunch French Toast tops my list. Grinding cereal and using it to create a crunchy crust is genius. I also enjoy the fresh fruit on top.\n\n2. Blu Jam Caf\u00e9 (7371 Melrose Avenue, Los Angeles, CA 90046): The Crunchy French Toast features a cornflake crust. It also has berries on top. I slightly like the Cap'N Crunch French Toast better because I enjoy the Cap'N Crunch crust a little more.\n\n3. Surrey Caf\u00e9 and Juice Bar: The Banana Foster's French Toast is on par with both. I give the other two the thinnest of margins because I love the cereal crust. Nevertheless, the banana cream and Banana Foster sauce is an equalizer.\n\nI also ordered a side of home fries. The potatoes had excellent seasoning and a nice crunchy skin. In addition, Surrey is a juice bar. I had a fresh squeezed orange juice. Is a large, 16 ounce juice really worth $6.50? Personally, I would not normally pay for it. However, I wanted to try a fresh juice since I saw great reviews for them. It was very good. Nevertheless, it is a lot more than I would want to pay for juice. I got to Surrey at 8 AM when it opens. The place is great so the seating will fill up quickly. On a Sunday, it was almost full by the time I left at 9 AM.\n\n4. Stanley Restaurant :Surrey's Caf\u00e9 and Juice Bar have a slight edge with the toast and Fosters sauce. However, Stanley's additional toppings (bananas, banana chips, and vanilla ice cream) and beautiful presentation is an equalizer.\n\nIf you are visiting New Orleans and looking for recommendations, please see If you are visiting New Orleans and looking for recommendations, feel free to message me through Yelp and I can share my itinerary, which includes my Yelp reviews.

    "text": "This place was a wonderful find for a late-night meal! We were at Chaifetz Arena for a concert on Saturday night and were hoping to find somewhere to eat in walking distance so that we didn't have to drive and hunt. It was 11pm so the first place we tried had already closed their kitchen. We then decided to try The Fountain. We were pleasantly surprised to be cheerily welcomed in and told the kitchen was open. And not only was the kitchen open but the menu options were great! As a vegetarian I was pleasantly suprised to find multiple options. I went with a veggie hummus sandwich on a unique and delicious bread. They had several unique and healthy side options as well. After a fairly healthy meal, we decided we could treat ourselves to the chocolate banana malt and it was fantastic! I am very glad we found the Fountain! In addition to the great menu, the decor is really cool and the staff was wonderful!",

    "text": "Aroy Thai is the newest addition to the Thips Thai/Sala Thai famly and does not disappoint!  It is located in a new strip mall just off highway 64's Green Mount  Rd. exit in O'Fallon, IL (less than a half hour drive from St. Louis).  It is nicely decorated, simple, earthy, and contemporary.\n\nThey have a few Chinese items on the menu, but it is primarily Thai.  I had the pleasure of doing a curry taste test at a recent Thai festival in Florrisant and Sala Thai was the best by far.  It is good to know their cook is carrying on the good cooking at a newer & nicer location!  \n\nToday, we sampled the tofu yellow curry, pad Thai, Thai sweet & sour shrimp, & Thai cashew chicken.  The Thai version of these dishes has more complex flavor combinations and is lighter and more delicious than simlar dishes from some of their Asian counterparts.  I loved it all!\n\nVegetarians will like Aroy, as well.  They have a large selection of interesting and tasty vegetarian items.\n\nThe food service is a wee bit slow and the items are priced a little high, but it is absolutely yummy!  My only real complaint is that it is small and they get packed early.  So give yourself some time.\n\nIt still amazes me that the four best Thai restaurants in the region are in the Metro East.  Come on St. Louis, can't we do better?",

    "text": "Several friends and I continued our mini-pub crawl of mixology bars (begun at Franklin Mortgage and Investment Co.) here. Good move!\n\nWe parked it at the bar and got the show from Sasha, the bartender, who kept up friendly banter with us even as she concocted a variety of beverages throughout the course of our stay. \n\nThe cocktail menu was fairly extensive, broken down into Prohibition- and Repeal-era drinks, not to mention long lists of bourbons, ryes, and scotches. I ordered an Aviation (a drink I make myself, with my own brandied cherries, but here they do it the right way, all out with Creme de Violette to tint it blue like the sky; Sasha let me take a look at the bottle, perhaps to know that it wasn't some awful curacao!) \nFor another friend she created a drink with Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction's Root liqueur (which is made with the roots and herbs used in old-fashioned root beer), chocolate bitters, seltzer and orange. \n\nWe also partook of food here: First, duck fat fries (which have been a trend in Chicago, where I live, for at least a year, but I'd never had them; I'd never eaten anything involving duck before this, so now I suppose I have lost my duck fat innocence). These were thick-cut, rich in taste [gratis the duck fat, one presumes], not actually greasy, but definitely better when ordered with the cup of cheese sauce on the side. \n\nWe also got soft pretzel sticks, which would have been fine but not especially remarkable without the mustard sauce (which had a distinct taste of raspberry, to my mind) pooled in the cup underneath them.\n\nOverall, this was a friendly place with fab drinks and great food. I wish it was in my city.",

    "text": "I'm still a bit in awe of the experience my wife and I had at Livery yesterday evening, and am trying to think through how to succinctly cover everything I want to share - but simply put, it was incredible.\n\nContext:\nIt was our Golden Anniversary last night, 6 years on the 6th... We had just briefly met Exec. Chef Casey Frank at an event this last Thursday, and decided to celebrate at Livery as we'd been meaning to stop by for awhile now. It seems he must have 1.) seen us come in; 2.) recognized who we were from the event; and 3.) remembered we had mentioned it was our anniversary that night - because after we placed our order of a salad and two entrees, the server came back out and informed us we should \"...forget about your order\" and wait for the experience Chef had lined up for us... \nWhat followed was an astounding 8-course small plate journey, with some of the most delicious and memorable flavor profiles we've encountered in Indianapolis. Chef Casey came out on two occasions to chat with us about the food and make sure we were having a good time. We felt like nothing short of royalty at 6:30pm on a Sunday. \n\nFood: (I'll highlight just a few dishes so as not to write a novel) \nSweet Plantains were culinary genius. Sweetness of the plantain, saltiness of black bean puree, spice from the habanero guajillo sauce, and brininess of the pickled onion in the pineapple salsa were perfectly balanced. The combinations were so complex, but you could still individually identify each component and the role they played in the dish. \nPork Tenderloin could be cut with a fork and was full of flavor. Slight char on the outside gave it smoke, which was complemented by an incredible sweet corn puree and spicy serrano hot sauce. \nScallop was the most well-prepared I've had in a long time. Perfect golden-brown sear on the outside, and so tender with not one bite of grit... A feat that, in my book, is quite an accomplishment! Served with a roasted carrot and poblano pico garnish, it was another masterful balance of sweet and heat while letting the seafood shine.\nChurros were a playful and well-executed nod to Latin street fare. Crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, with a wonderful caramel sauce that was obviously made in-house. \n\nService:\nOur server Tommy was a delight, from the first moment when he brought us 2 complimentary champagnes to toast. Friendly, knowledgeable, and attentive, he engaged my wife and I just enough to provide quality service and make sure everything was in order, while giving us privacy to enjoy each other's company. We very much enjoyed his service!\n\nI honestly don't know what we did to deserve such a gift, but sincere and heartfelt thanks - To Chef Casey, Tommy, and Livery - for making our Golden Anniversary so very special. My only regret is not taking pictures before devouring every bite! We will certainly be coming back, and are adamant about spreading the word on this gem of an Indy restaurant.",

I can't help but be a repeat offender of their Rainbow bowl.  OMG it is out of this world fresh and delicious.  Their granola adds the perfect crunch, who doesn't love coconut and honey and there are so many gorgeous colors in this bowl.  If you are looking for some \"Acai-cream\" as a healthier alternative to the yogurt and ice cream pretending to be healthy.. You must come here and try them.  \n\nThey also have cold pressed juices and lots of other delicious things.  This is just my favorite bowl!",

The look and feel of the restaraunt is perfect for a date night or a meeting, it's not too big and not too loud so you can actually hold a conversation with who you're dining with. The drinks and food here are very good. The bartenders take crafting a cocktail seriously and you can see this and taste this in their drinks. The food is fresh and appetizing. Their tacos are simply delicious, the corn tortillas are a perfect thickness and the meats and tacos filling is so fresh and so filling.

Im more of the food trucks and hole in the walls type, so this was different than what Im used to. \n\nThe atmosphere at Besito is tough to beat. They have Merengue & Salsa on the background which doesn't really go with the Mexican theme but who's paying attention. An ideal Date night atmosphere for sure. \n\nFood here is fantastic. A little pricey, but you get your money's worth. You have the ($3) valet outside, great service, waiters have always been friendly and happy to discuss the menu, Besito more than met our expectations. \n\nIf you love Mexican food, and feel like taking it to another level for once, Besito is your place. It's a gourmet mexican restaurant, certainly worth trying.",

The description on his website was exactly what we got.  Several other reviews have covered the main points of the class.  \n\nIn short - we had a great time and highly recommend the class.  It was one of the highlights of our few days in New Orleans.  It was a fun, laid back, way to spend an afternoon.  Learned a few things.  Created and ate some great food.  If you're on the fence, definitely do it.\n\nWe attended a Sunday class that started at 11:00 AM.  The first ferry is at 11:00 AM on Sunday and the trip over only took a few minutes.  (Ferry tip: the fare is $2 per person each way.  Bring *exact change*.)  \n\nI'd recommend calling him on the way so he knows you are arriving.\n\nWe ate a late breakfast before the class and that worked great.  Keep in mind that it takes a while to cook everything, so don't expect to eat until late afternoon.  You don't want to be cooking while you are starving.\n\nMy wife has a couple of food allergies and we let him know in advance.  Chef made some adjustments to accommodate, although he wasn't able to eliminate the allergens completely.  (We understood.  It's difficult when you aren't used to it.)\n\nWe did read the reviews here before booking.  So glad we didn't let the one negative opinion keep us from having a good time.",

We also ordered the custom-made guacomole for the table; a server came out and made it for us right at the table. And just as swiftly as he had made it, the four of us devoured it.  SO good.  And the waitress was super-attentive and more than willing to offer recommendations.\n\nOn top of everything, the place has a very cool atmosphere and is on a stretch of south street which is very pretty, especially on a temperate spring/summer night--perfect for a little post-dinner stroll or if you're en route to some bar hopping later.\n\nTry this place--you won't regret it.",

None of these dishes were things that I would normally order.\n\nI like steak and deep fried appetizers. That's not what we had. We went in for a chef's table where chef Paul offered to cook us a multi course menu of his design.\n\nIt started with duck pate on French toast with Saskatoon berry jam. It blew my mind. I hate Saskatoons, but these were firm and paired perfectly with the savoury and sweet toast and the house made duck pate was amazing.\n\nI would run you through every course in detail but the truth is they were all amazing. The basics were:\n\n1.Duck pate French toast 10/10\n2.3 color Beet salad with beet jam and balsamic dressing 10/10\n3.Jalapeno tuna poke 10/10\n4.Pantry board of fresh charcuterie with at least 10 different items 10/10\n5. Cream cheese and mushroom ravioli with fresh grated truffle and parmesan 11/10\n6.double duck sausage and gnocchi with veg. 10/10\n7. Lemon tart 10/10\n\nwe were promised 5-6 course with wine pairings and what we got was a menu of heaven. Every bite better than the last. Nothing was under thought, everything was executed perfectly. The service was on point the water was always full.\n\nThe open style kitchen allowed a unique vantage point that made me feel like chef Paul only worked on our meal all night. I can't wait to go back and cannot express enough much amazing this meal was.",

Upon my return to Tucson I was surprised to see that it was still open and still great!  They have a wonderful hearty red sauce which enhances every dish on which it is used.  The manicotti and parmesan dishes are outstanding.  Their house Italian dressing is my favorite anywhere.  They do have a special lunch menu.  They do not take reservations for smaller parties, so it is good to come early for weekend dinner to avoid a wait for a table.",

The chips were great, but the dip was way too salty. I'm not sure if the dip was supposed to be that salty or if maybe the chips' seasonings brought out more saltiness, but my taste receptors were screaming. But then it was time for the main attraction of the night: our large 1/2 Bucktown and 1/2 South Side Classico. At first I thought a large would be too much food, but between my boyfriend and me, we really only ended up with three pieces of leftover (pizza for breakfast is unparalleled, am i right?). The cornmeal crust was perfectly crunchy and flavorful. The toppings of each specialty pizza complemented each other well. The tomato sauce was a bit on the tart side and fairly overpowering but delicious all the same. The restaurant itself has loads of seating and the ambiance is nice. I would highly recommend Pi if you're in St. Louis and have a hankering for deep dish.",

We showed up at 6:15 with no reservation and walked right in. By 6:30 there was a line at the door and an hour wait. The menu offers an eclectic mix and it all looked amazing!  We had the short rib appetizer to start. Which was glazed in an Asian sauce with a little kick yum!!. My husband had pasta with a white sauce which I swear he hummed with delight thru every bite. I kept it simple with a burger which I was told would be life changing. They weren't kidding! I have dreamt of it nightly since our visit. Will I go back?  Hell yeah!  I'd camp out for this place !!",

I stop here A LOT, TOOO MUCH for lunch and I've become familiar with the things that they do well and the things they don't. Even their soups can sometimes be bland and sad. I still appreciate their food though, on a busy day when you want something wholesome it's one of the only places to run in and out, well near my work anyway. I have to say their breakfast bar on Saturdays and (I think also on Sundays) pretty much blows the one at Whole Foods out of the water. In fact I would say their hot bar is just better than all the hot bars at Whole Foods combined. So take that.",

I ordered from Golden Triangle last night but I can't remember the details because of the fat and the lazy. \n\nI think I ordered roti cani, but I can't be sure. Definitely some sort of Indian chili chicken which was delish -- the sauce was a fascinating blend of red curry, brown sugar and about 15 other spices I can't put my finger on.\n\nI eschewed a side dish in favor of 2 desserts -- the peanut pancakes, which look and taste exactly as you'd imagine and the falooda/faluda, one of the single most delicious, creatively concocted beverages a have ever had the pleasure of slurping down in 40 seconds. This thing is traditionally made from mixing rose syrup, vermicelli, sweet basil (sabza/takmaria) seeds, and pieces of jelly with milk, often topped off with a scoop of ice cream.\n\nSounds bizarre. Google it and see. It's okay, I'll wait.\n\nWell that took you long enough! See what I mean? Crazy, right? I cannot recommend it highly enough.\n\nBonus: You can grab some scene cred just by eating a few of these Malaysian things no one has ever heard of.\n\n***** Would faluda again.",

You can see one half of a breakfast sandwich in my picture. All of this for just $6.99. A very good value considering their normal bakery items are a bit expensive - but worth it.",

The large head-on shrimp are simmered in a rich sauce of butter, Worcestershire sauce and Creole seasoning and served with French bread. The flavor in this dish is beyond incredible, and after the shrimp are all eaten I'm sopping up every last bit of sauce with the bread.\n \nFor the rest of the review, visit: http://dashofles.com/blog/new-orleans-birthday-weekend/",

I prefer to go there when I can get an outside table, or when I visit with a particular group of friends who also share in my sentiment of fondness. Now what the heck took me so long to experience Zorba's delivery?! Shame on me. It's the same delicious food, just in my pajamas in front of my TV. \n\nHaving experienced a day that could only be fixed by delivery, my husband handled all of the order details. I believe he placed directly with them, as we were able to pay in cash when the delivery guy arrived. The wait time was standard- I don't recall it arriving early nor do I recall being antsy about its whereabouts. \n\nI'm no stranger to the Imam Baldi. I think every time I have this eggplant in red sauce souffl\u00e9, I go on the record that this dish can turn me into a vegetarian. It came with the standard sides of rice, veggies and potatoes, all separated by little dividers as to not mingle. \n\nWe were first timers to the Skordalia. Think extra, extra whipped mashed potatoes with extra, extra garlic. Move over (already fabulous hummus), you may have just been replaced in our repertoire. Okay, I kid. We'll just get both and have leftovers.\n\nSpeaking of leftovers, we totally were able to split our order into two meals. Score!  \n\nLove that fresh bread they put on the table? Don't worry, you get that too. \n\nI'll still visit their actual location, but it's really good to know that I can get my Zorba's fix in the comfort of my own home.",

    "text": "The carnivore aficionado will know that real barbecued meat will have a nice pink ring from the hours of cooking in the smoke. The meat at Brady's has this coveted pink ring. They have three sauces to supplement the meat- thick and sweet, thick and spicy, both tomato based and a mustard based sauce. I was a little disappointed when he said he had something hotter than the thick and spicy sauce and proceeded to bring over a bottle of buffalo style sauce and a bottle of branded hot sauce that I find to be rather mild with a flavor more appropriate for buffalo wings. Needless to say, I stuck with the thick and spicy and the mustard based sauces, both of which I found to be quite worthy of applying to good BBQ.\n\nYou won't find garlic toast or fries at Brady's. Instead you have a choice of sides like garlic red potatoes, black-eyed peas, and corn bread pudding. They have a \"try\" portion for $1. Since I've never had cornbread pudding, I tried the corn bread pudding and the portion was closer to what I would have expected from a regular sized order instead of a \"try\".\n\nI know I'll be returning to Brady's the next time I'm in Safety Harbor craving BBQ.",

Its really shocking to me that very few places bother to do this.  Gravy was tasty, but could have used a little more.  Now, in all fairness, I treat gravy like an entree as opposed to an accompaniment, so for \"normal\" folk, you may find the gravy quantity acceptable.  I went with bacon, which was really good - thick slices, nice and crispy.  And my eggs were cooked perfectly to order.  I really liked the crispy potatoes, as well.  Two, small whole potatoes, well seasoned and seared on the outside.  The OJ was fresh and tasty - not too tart. \n\nMy friend had the nest egg.  She thought it was really tasty, but since I didn't try it, I don't have much to say about that. \n\nI think the food is excellent.  I will agree with other reviews - not a fan of the community seating.  We didn't have an issue finding a seat and people did move along quickly, but since folks tend to want to catch up over a meal, you don't really have the privacy or the space to do that here.  I am hoping the excellent food results in more seating!!",

I don't know what's so Southern about these green beans. But they were flatter and longer. And bacon was involved. Bingo!\n\nAn incredibly juicy medium cheeseburger , , , really good.

    "text": "I've been to New Orleans several times but this time I was looking for a different kind of dessert type of treat aside from the go-to beignets. So I found this spot on Yelp. They had 8-10 flavors to choose from so we got 4 of them. Praline bacon, raspberry white chocolate, pineapple upside down, and cookies and milk. Praline bacon was the 1st one we tried and it was a tough act to follow! It was a flavor party where sweet, savory and yummy had me dancing. The pineapple upside donut was good. The raspberry was my least favorite. However, the cookies and milk pulled up the rear and made the wait worth it. Overall, the donuts are great and whatever batter they use for the actual donut is really tasty. I will be back for some donuts AND sliders next time.",

Seriously the best food in the city.\n\nService:\nOur waitress looked like Anne Hathaway and she was really nice.  They strive to make sure you enjoy their food.  At one point she noticed that we didn't like the goat that was served as our 6th course - even though we said it was okay somehow she knew we didn't like it (I think they bugged our table).  They actually gave us an extra course of the Hallibut to make up for it - which was awesome.\n\nAmbience:\nThe restaurant is in a row home on Spruce street.

And since they are relatively new  (opened summer 2008 I believe) they are very clean.  \n\nI have been there a few times now and I have to the the Sex and the City, Hurricane, and their deep friend rolls are my favorites.  Their appetizers are also great (monkey brains- spicy stuffed mushrooms and soft shell crab).  Their fish are surprisingly very fresh for being so far from the ocean.  But if you'd like to try something different, their Korean dishes such as their Bulgogi and BBQ ribs (prepared in a Korean traditional way) are also a good way to go.\n\nAs for service, the servers and owner Eugene cannot be any more friendly.

Great food and the house wine is really good (and inexpensive). You almost feel as if you were invited into someone's home. A belly dancer even came out in the middle of our meal! \n\nWe went pretty early on a Saturday night, so the fact that we didn't have a reservation wasn't a problem.

    "text": "Always worth the wait. Filling this review out after I've gone a few times (5-6 times). Immaculate baked goods, inspiring latte combinations, creative soulful brunch food. I recommend grabbing a latte and a baked good to munch on while you wait. \n\nI've had few dishes I haven't loved.  I normally find it hard to narrow down the options, I normally ask the wait staff bc there always seems to be a few dishes that rise above the others. The sorghum bacon is always pretty impressive and a crowd pleaser and I've definitely ordered a few different versions of the Dutch baby. Happy brunching!",

    "text": "DELICIOUS.  My friend and I stopped here last night after a concert at festival pier. We were both starving so we ordered the bacon grease popped popcorn before our waiter even said hello. The waiter was awesome, friendly and very attentive. The popcorn was so incredibly delicious seasoned perfectly with cayenne and paprika type spices. I cannot wait to eat it again!!!! \n\nI got the burger and fries,  both so good. The burger was juciy, definitely better than your average. It can definitely compete with fountain porter and silk city.\n\nMy friend got the fried chicken, mac and cheese and a biscuit.  The biscuit was huge and incredibly good. Moist, dense and perfect flavor.  Not too floury or salty.  The mac and cheese was soooo good. I usually do not like mac and cheese unless it is homemade at restaurants because it just tastes flavorless and salty. But this mac and cheese was definitely homemade and it was delicious, there was so much cheese and it had a delicious crust on top.\n \n basically, I cannot wait to go back again this place was so great.",

    "text": "I adore In-N OUt burgers - get them animal style or try them in a lettuce wrap (protein style).  They've got a special menu not listed (http://www.in-n-out.com) and their fries are amazing - you can actually taste the potato in them.  Their menu is very basic but it's all you need - burgers, fries, and shakes.",

    "text": "4-star beer, 5-star ambiance. This is the most impressive and promising brewery in Santa Barbara. \n\nInside they have a high ceiling, exposed wood rafters and black underlayment with an array of chalkboard panels for the tap list. It looks like the tap list changes by switching out these large panels, which give you the beer name and its essential characteristics like IBUs, ABV, style, volume poured. The list looked inspired with a range of styles from sours, Berliners, stouts, pilsners, and IPAs.\n\nThey offer very nice tasting flights, which our group did. You grab a draft list and just tick the ones you want to try. This system takes a lot of work and annoyance out of the process - a great idea. The beer quality was a bit all over the place, which is expected from a new brewery. However, some showed a lot of promise and I think Third Window has what it takes to improve their recipes. Detailed notes are below. I ended up liking their pilsner, The Light, the best and got it in a large format mug pour. \n\nPretzels and popcorn are available, which is a nice touch. Dog friendly interior is a huge bonus as well.\n\n~~~~~~~~~\n\nExtra feedback for beer nerds and the brewery:\n\nThe Light 1.1\nThis was an outstanding German style pilsner with a bright lemon lime nose with beautiful citrus zestiness. Hefty carbonation and brilliant clarity much appreciated. The flavor was dry and a tad powdery, but the finish was neutral and refreshing. This was my absolute favorite of the beers I tried so I got a large pour in a giant mug. \n\nBrett Saison\nLooking beautiful in the glass, glowing neon yellow with generous carbonation. The aroma is sawdust, barn, candied mango. The flavor is bubbly, neautral, and very dry but not abrasive. Refreshing, though a tad washed out in the flavor.\n\nRakau Welch\nLooking identical to the Brett saison but with a more impressive aroma with fresh corn grits, lemongrass, dill, fennel, oregano - super herbal. The flavor is dry, neutral, refreshing. The farmyard character of saison is spot on here. Simple, dry, but not abrasive.\n\nXexo\nSuper dry for an IPA that wants to deliver sticky caramel aromas and flavor, but the palate is way too washed out and the bitterness becomes abrasive. Needed some work. \n\nThe \u00d6KO BOMB\nInky black in color, but much too thin a body for stout. The nose is savory chocolate mousse, big raisin, chocolate covered raisin. But the flavor is too dry and moves to grape soda, grape cough syrup and tootsie roll.\n\nExecutioner's Daughter\nClear amber in color. This one had intense vinegar (acetic acid) and nail polish remover (ethyl acetate) in the nose. Taste is very nice, however, with cinnamon, mild sugar, dark bread, banana nut bran muffin. Great mouthfeel.\n\nThe Origin 2016\nThis was billed as a dry-hopped APA, but the aroma was sticky with thick caramel and butterscotch. The flavor was watery and bland. Overall, it seemed dead and not what was intended.",
