    "text": "Finally made it down for brunch today, and loved everything.  Great service, great mimosas.  Food was amazing.  We ordered the loaded biscuits and gravy, sweet potato hash, and 'chicken' & waffles.   So delicious.  Would LOVE to see a kids' menu at brunch.  The regular portion is a bit too much food, and a little pricy, for our 6yr old. But it tasted good, so we helped eat his meal. :) \n\nWill absolutely be back. Try the noochy grits and the braised kale!  Yum!",

All 3  rolls were delicious. \n\nI will say they were notably smaller than other sushi spots. We noticed right away after sharing 3 rolls that we were not bursting with fullness as usual.\n\nPrices were typical. Specialty roll options not as abundant as competitors. Groupon deal was irresistible. Would have no problem returning but a couple other spots would probably be my first choice.",

They have a huge buffet for them, so on big holidays I will feast out! \n\nTheir food is good! Caesar salad amazing! Love their crabcakes! Great fish tacos! Yummy warm bread and soft butter. \n\nThey are very pricey! Its an upscale type of restaurant so that is expected and it's on the water. However, I still come in my gym clothes and sit at the bar to eat, but honestly, I can careless about what I look like. I still pay the same price as everyone else. Still spend money! Plus I will stop in, eat at bar, and leave. So dont feel you have to be dressed up because its fine dinning. \n\nI give it 4 Stars because at Happy Hour time I will come in to eat food at Happy Hour prices. Well, the prices are cheaper on the crab-cakes but they are beyond small. They cut the portions way down with price too. I Still spent $40 when I just got salad, crab-cakes and 1 cocktail. And the serving sizes were small! \n\nIts also very different looking in there. Old and country like. I really dont know what else to call it. Just so you know, its not a hangout place at all. Just a dinner experience. Or they hold events there, think they are big for that. Its huge in there. Plenty of parking too! \n\nYou should try them out, just as long as you go in knowing what to expect. \n\nHope my review helps you!",

I dont' know if they still make it, but the Chilean sea bass with pumpkin mole was one of the tastiest things I've ever eaten. \nMy husband and I visited last Sunday for Brunch and we ordered a TON of food because we had a $50 gift certificate to use up. I can highly reccommend the Huevos Divorciados and the Omlette Poblano. I am a poblano and mushroom lover and the oaxaca cheese melts into the eggs and veggies in the most wonderful way. My husband had the Divorciados and it was both unusual and tasty! \nMy favorite at Las Cazuelas are the tacos- the steak with fresh onions and cilantro is by far the winner in my book and I confess, I have dreamed of them and often cannot resist the urge to go get a big plate of them! We tried the marinated steak tacos this time and did not like them very much- there was a red coating of marinade on the steak and it was overwhelming. You could not taste the yummy, meat-y, grilled flavor that is so great in the regular steak tacos. My husband loved the shredded pork tacos and I thought they were ok. The shrimp tacos are always a winner and taste fresh, crisp and light. I suppose it is the pure flavors and how they usually treat the fresh ingredients that brings me back time and again, I will veer away from the overly marinated items in the future. As always, the cafe de Olla (coffee with cinnamon +) and desserts are very good. I tell everyone about this place and always bring it up as an option when we have folks in from out of town. Keep up the great work!!",

Lots of veggies, meat and some seafood. One pass or unlimited, all you can eat style, it's your choice. Add their soup and bread and you are good to go for the price point you select.\nYou have to envision what the raw ingredients are going to look like after they are cooked. Obviously, a bowl overflowing with raw veggies and meat is going to be quite a bit smaller when cooked as shown in the pictures online. \nGood service and helpful and friendly staff. We found it to be very clean given that most of any mess is customer created when they are sloppy loading their bowl. \nI wish they had lamb as many of this style restaurant do. Next time I will really up the \"Hot\" quotient in the saucing. It is an experience, you cannot really duplicate this as a sit down, point and order restaurant.

    "text": "We made the journey through the cold and snow, all the way out to St Charles, with our friends the D's to try Hendricks BBQ.  We found a warm bustling place with a nice Saturday night feel and some decent barbecue.  Hendricks offers most meat choices that you would expect; both St Louis style and back ribs, pulled pork, brisket, turkey and sausage (what no goat? Oh well.)  Hendricks has a seriously large menu, obviously centered around barbecue, but the weirdo in your party could find something else to eat.\n\nWe had a great waiter, Aaron.  He was well informed ( I was impressed that he actually knew the definition of St Louis style spare ribs) and when we each ordered a Pick 2 platter, he informed us that each couple could split The Whole Shebang for the same price and actually get to sample all six meats for the same price, so that is what we did.  Apparently it is a default to serve the meat without sauce, which \"meats\" with my approval.  There are four sauces on the table.  Each of these trays of meat comes with four sides; so Ms T and I had two slaws, greens and sweet potato fries.  The D's added cheddar grits, sweet potato casserole, green beans and baked beans.  So here we go from first to worst.\n\nHendricks makes good ribs.  Both the St Louis style and the back ribs were smoky, moist, tender and nicely seasoned with rub.  The rub is the same on all meats and has a slight sweetness.  If it were over-applied, it would be too sweet, but it was in the proper proportion.  I would order these ribs any time and to me there is really no significant reason to choose one over the other.\n\nNext for me was the pulled pork.  I am not a fan of pulled pork in Missouri.  Often it is in large hunks and dry.  This was pulled to bite size and was moist, but not wet.  I would recommend this for a sandwich and it would be my second choice after the ribs.\n\nThe brisket was surprisingly good for this neck of the woods.  It had a good balance of smoke bark and beefy flavor.  It was nice and tender, but was on the edge of dry.  This would also make a good sandwich, but might require some mayo to lube it up.  I know this can vary a lot from brisket to brisket.  This is also worth ordering but at least this one night, was not quite as good as PM in Chesterfield  Valley.  Still pretty good for Missouri.\n\nTurkey breast and sausage bring up the rear and I would not re-order them.  Turkey is always a real gamble.  If it is not overdone and you get to eat it as it is sliced, before any juices run out, it can be magnificent, as we experienced at Black's Barbecue in Texas.  This had pretty mild smoke and was fairly dry.  It was not sawdust though and you could make a sandwich with plenty of mayo that would be credible.  I just would not order it again, though on another night it might be fine.  \n\nThe sausage was, hmmmm.  I almost liked it.  It was not like Hillshire Farms (a point in its favor).  It had some nice heat, Ms T and the D's found it too spicy but it is not really.  I like the locally made jalapeno and plain sausages in Texas.  They can be sensational.  My issue with this was that it tasted like Pine Sol.  This is either carelessness at the butcher shop with disinfectant or it has a spice in it resulting in that flavor.  Is it juniper berries?  A-1 Steak Sauce kind of has the Pine Sol thing going, maybe they are basting it with that or it is in the mix.  Whatever, all I can think of is \"the Power of Pine Sol, Baby\" when eating it.  I'll pass on that next time.\n\nSides - Ms D declared the green beans to be just a little better than plain out of the can.  (try some at Alcenia's in Memphis) They loved the sweet potato casserole, likening it to dessert.  They liked the cheesy grits and the baked beans.  I did not sample them.  Aaron warned me off the baked beans due to onion.  \n\nThe only think Aaron was not accurate on was the slaw.  He thought it had no onion, but that was all I could taste.  This is very finely ground (not shredded) slaw in the style that you get on dogs and burgers in Carolina.  It is unique, but inedible.  This was one of those rare times when we left the slaw.  It is unspeakably bad.  The sweet potato fries were fine.  The collard greens with bacon were good.  They were cooked well enough and seasoned with meat.  I enjoyed them.  There are even more sides to try.\n\nHendricks was worth the drive on a winter night.  I think we need to meet our St Charles friends, the L's there.  So go, have some ribs, maybe a pulled pork and brisket sandwich.  You will want to bring your own slaw.  I'm going to be generous and go four stars on the strength of the ribs.",

It goes great with the accompanying curry sauce, which also contains some pieces of chicken and potato. \n\nI also tried out the indian mee goreng on my most recent visit. It certainly had a lot of taste and went well with the other dishes I ordered, but a warning that there is a strong seafood taste (they use dried squid sauce).\n\nAnother favorite of mine is the beef rendang. The beef is super tender and the curry sauce it is cooked in is delicious - tastes of coconut milk and lemongrass, with hints of cinnamon. Order a bowl or two of rice to go with this!\n\nFinally, I would order the spareribs malaysian style. These pork shortribs are lightly fried, but the meat is juicy and goes really well with the accompanying sweet and sour sauce! \n\nService overall is quite good and the food comes out at a reasonable pace. This place does get crowded though!",

The space is small but I like the sparkly booth seats.\n\n The ice cream selection is small but there is definitely something for everyone. I had the peach vanilla and it was fresh and tasty. My only small point was that the peaches bits were large so they got a bit icy to the tooth. But that's probably me just being a weirdo. My friend loved her toasted coconut and it was yummy. \n\nThe business is cash only and supposedly also has snowballs but I didn't see anyone get those while I was there.",

I also thought the food was worth it.\n\nI had the breaded pork tenderloin with whiite gravy, which was massive and just incredible. It is so not to eat something you know was just made. This is a reason to go somewhere this busy, the food is giong to be really fresh! Nice turn over. but I digress. The mac and cheese, who said it isn't real cheese? It obviously is and is obviosly homemade, perhaps you are lazy or don't know what a  cheese sauce it....  creamy and good. Mashed potatoes, they were good, everyone else raved. The gravy was good. I mean they aren't out of a box... I should have had teh fried ones. I had a chees cake with cherry topping, just great.\n\nI will say two people had teh strawberry pir and although they gave high marks to the quality of teh strawberries and the real whipped cream (yes, not out of a can!) they thought the crust was meh.\n\nOkay, excellent place and though we waited there was ample seating. My serious fear! \n\nIf I lived here I would eat here, If I pass through again, I will eat here. I might tryo find out if there was a better time to get there. Is it this crowed from 11-8:30?

While I approached, I was shocked and delighted to not find a long line out front, which is rare. I guess I got lucky with my timing today. \n\nThe man working the counter was very helpful. As there was not a mass of people behind me, I took the time to ask after special flavor combinations they offered. After he named off a few, which all sounded good, I opted to go for my own flavor combo. \n\nMy snowball was served within minutes to order, the ice nicely shaved, and the flavors delicious. The condensed milk was in perfect proportion to the ice. After I took a few bites, and started to walk off, the man at the counter called out to ask how it was. It was amazing as always and the perfect treat for this hot day. \n\nI like that they keep the cost down in this popular spot. Gives the chance for kids to come with their pocket money. I'd love to see a bench or two for seating, but the hood of my car did nicely today.",

    "text": "Thank you for a lovely morning!  I was in NJ early and decided to stop in for a delicious diner breakfast.  I got a taylor ham, egg, and cheese and a short stack of blueberry pancakes (I simply couldn't decide between sweet or savory, plus leftovers are never a bad thing).  \n\nThe egg sandwich was fantastic.  I was nervous when they said they didn't have kaiser rolls so I went with a hamburger roll.  It was an excellent decision.  The roll was excellent - not just an average cheap hamburger roll.  They layered the cheese on the sandwich, which to me is a must for a true egg sandwich.  It was served with home fries, which were sauteed with large slices of peppers and onions.  I'm not the biggest breakfast potatoes fan, but these were great and I appreciated that they didn't clearly just scoop some food from a huge pile of pre-cooked home fries.\n\nThe pancakes were great and fluffy.  My one gripe was their use of smuckers pre-packaged syrup.  I realize that if they put syrup in a container, it probably wouldn't be real maple syrup, but I sort of wish I didn't know that they were giving me sub-par syrup.\n\nThe server was friendly and very attentive.  The coffee refills were constant, and the coffee was actually good (so many diners fail at coffee).  Bonus points for the server agreeing not to judge my decision to get two breakfasts.\n\nAll around, I loved this place and hope to go back soon.  Long live the Jersey diners!",

    "text": "It is typical Broad Ripple charming spot. Small, trendy and bustling with activity. They do not take reservations. Which is somewhat annoying when you are traveling from another part of town. Whatever, we just had to arrange to arrive earlier than we would have liked to hopefully secure a table, which we did. When we arrived it was quiet and only several tables had guests seated. As our dinner progressed it became more crowded until every seat was filled. Nice lively scene except then you can not hear squat! It made dinner conversation difficult. Boo!!!! I think this could be an easy fix for them. \n\nMeal/Drinks:  The cocktails were creative and tasted wonderful. Our servers suggestions were pretty spot on as we enjoyed most of her suggestions. \n\nThe guacamole was very good with the exception of the fact that my friend has a nut allergy and we asked to have them left off and of coarse they arrived with them on! They really weren't necessary in my opinion either as I don't think they add much to the dish. The reason I wanted to try this restaurant- The Harvest salad! We all split this as well and it was good. The combination of fruit and root vegetables was delish! The figs were so good and the herbed goat cheese mouse was a highlight on this plate!\n\nTwo of us ordered the Veracruz Trigger fish and the other ordered the Serrano Scallops and all of it was wonderful. The white sweet mashed potatoes were interesting! I am glad we tried them. The Veracruz sauce was wonderful and full of flavor. It was a lot of food though. Had we known we would have probably skipped one of the first course selections or split an entree. That'a ok though- lunch for today :)\n\nWe also tried the Tostones and Stewed Black Beans. Beans were very good, full of flavor! Tostones seemed very dry but maybe that is what they are supposed to be- this is the first time I have had them. BUT, dipped in the Stewed Black Beans they tasted great!\n\nWe passed on dessert as they had no gluten free, dairy free options. Delicia offers many options for restricted diets, which we loved. Just no dessert, which is probably better anyway-we were so full! \n\nGo, you will not be disappointed. Just go before 7pm on a Friday night to ensure a table.",

    "text": "Save your money and your time and go here!\n\nThis place is cheap and the portion sizes are what is expected! I ordered the bahn mi with everything on it as starter and I was very pleased at how good it tasted and pricing about 2.50 something per sandwich you can't beat that! In the sandwich was liver pate, butter mayo whatever that good yellow sauce is, pork meat, pickled carrots and daikon radishes, cilantro, and jalepenos! One thing I did not like was how salty the pork tasted but I still ate the sandwich anyways. The bread was perfectly toasted and crusty, just the way bahn mi should taste! Also, to go alongside with my sandwich I got me a honeydew bubble tea. Man was this bubble tea awesome and flavorful and just the right consistency and the tapioca balls even were cooked just the way it should! \n\nNext, I ordered the pho with beef and meatballs. OMG, I forgot how good this pho tasted like the last time I ate here years ago. The bowl was huge for just about $7. This price and portion beats Thai Papaya down in the Antioch area. And even my daughter enjoyed at how good the texture of the rice noodles were! I usually add in hoisin sauce, sriracha, and whatever condiments are on the table depending on what I crave. But the pho broth without all the other added extra stuff is good without it!\n\nWhat can I say about service? Well, they are really busy tending to other customers as well as this place is really busy and popular! At one point my water needed a refill but they never came to check on me after bringing my food. That leaves me with knocking down 1 stars.\n\nAs other Yelp reviewers said, BRING CASH! And for less than $20 pre tip I ate all this food in one sitting and left with a full happy belly. Go here, try out their pho... your taste buds will thank you!",

    "text": "I must have missed the memo.  When did Chili's get much better?  I haven't been in a Chili's in years and begrudgingly went to dinner here.  I was surprised to see a nice, modern looking restaurant.  All of the tchotchkes hanging from the wall/ceiling (ala Cracker Barrell) I'm used to seeing at Chili's were gone and the place looked really nice.  They had a special that we happily took advantage of.  For $20 two people can split an appetizer (hello bottomless chips and salsa!) and then each get a full-sized entree.  That is one good deal and the food wasn't half bad either!  The most impressive thing to me were the touchscreen units that were present on each table.  It's so annoying when you are done with your meal and want to leave but can't because you either haven't gotten the bill or the server hasn't come back with your credit card.  When we were ready to go I was able to swipe my credit card in the unit, select a tip amount, and get a printed receipt.  It couldn't have been faster or more efficient.  The touchscreens also can serve as a distraction for your children.  For a buck you can let them play Peggle, Bejeweled, etc.  Sure you could argue that you could just buy those games on your phone for a dollar, but your phone isn't tied up while the kids are playing.  I think it's brilliant!  This was a surprisingly good experience.",

My Dad was less impressed with the catfish and hush puppies, but that's coming from someone who was born and raised in the South.

It's been a long time since I've had Pho and while the broth and accompaniments were on point, I remembered why it had been so long since having it. Too much involved with the noodles and the broth and then of course I over did it with the sriracha! But still -- very flavorful. I should have gone with the Pho with chicken instead of the Pho with Eye-Round steak, Flank, Fat Brisket, Tendon & Tripe. The Basil chicken was beyond amazing. I have to admit, I did not think I'd eat the whole portion, but I did. It was 2pm and I hadn't eaten all day so needless to say, I was starving!! The amount of veggies in this dish was great. Eggplant, snow pea pods, green, red, yellow and orange peppers, mushrooms, string beans! But that special spicy sauce. OMG I could eat that like it was soup. Delish! I keep on forgetting what the summer roll is and each time I order it, I wanna smack myself for not remembering. I don't really like the wrapper. Pardon me for being vulgar, but it reminds me of a condom. I meant to order the rolls that are fried! Oh well, next time I'll get it right. Overall, for my first time ordering here, I was pleased.  I'd definitely recommend the Yelp Deal. I wish I was able to find a menu online, otherwise I would have ordered ahead of time!",

The menu is quite large here and fortunately most things I've eaten from Nirvana have been on the tasty side. My latest meal began with the well known Punjabi dish - Fish Amritsari.  This was done just right.  My main course went to the south of India as I ordered a Kerala pepper chicken.  Again I was pleased although the predominant sauce it was cooked in seemed remarkably similar to sauces used in many Indian dishes from other parts of India.  Anyway, the service is especially friendly here - the staff seem to already know most of the people dining here which is a good sign of repeat business.

The Mac and cheese that came with the platter tasted a little stale though, but as a side dish it worked out okay. I would recommend getting the roti instead - it comes out hot, with a substantial filling, and is really satisfying to eat. \n\nWould love to come back to try the juices or pastries - they have a pretty big assortment on the menu!",

The Rotolo is dough wrapped around mortadella and ricotta cheese and topped with pistachios and oil. It is so good. I order it every time. It's about the size of a bun and cost $5. The pizza was amazing. The prosciutto was incredibly tasty. The dough is divine. The service is always great and the beer selection is good. Definitely one of the best pizza places in Philly.",

The karaoke machine is fairly up to date, plus they have the actual music videos. Food is good as well! \n\nWent on a Friday from 8-11 for a friend's birthday. We had probably 40 people in the room and we fit pretty comfortably. You have to order for the whole group (and they'll bring out the same dishes to each table) but so much food comes out and it's all pretty good so there shouldn't be an issue where someone has nothing they want to/can eat. The food is pretty standard for Chinatown in terms of taste and options, but if you're not sure what to get some popular dishes are: walnut shrimp, salt baked squid, steamed pot fish, and any veggie dish. Just get whatever you want, it'll all be good.\n\n*They're also really nice in dealing with drunken/rowdy groups, so this is where large groups go to get smashed.",

This place is right off of Main St in Edwardsville, IL. This is a grab and go place. Parking lot across the street. The bakery boasts chairs but only in their front window. The owners greet the customers and it is a quick grab and go. Today we tried the cookies, They had four different kinds in the case, and after I got my order and man walked in and asked for the cookies that they were famous for, just my luck they were coming out of the oven. They are a triple(yes triple) chocolate cookie. I selected the Blueberry Almond cookie, it was chocked full of blueberries, I almost did not feel guilty eating it because it had two super foods (blueberry and almonds). We also got the chocolate chip, this was a little crusty, I am sure it would be a good dunking cookie, but I only dunk basketballs not cookies. Finally we got the oatmeal raisin. It was a nice cookie, but I think my recipe is better. The place lives up to its name... Bonus, they do sell coffee to go...No almond milk though.",

    "text": "It was my fiance's birthday and he decided he wanted a good, laid back Thai restaurant for dinner. Yelp steered us in the Jasmine Rice direction, and it was definitely a good decision. We wanted the summer rolls, which were on the menu, but apparently will not be available until summer, so we settled on the pan-fried dumplings. The flavor was good, but I don't think we'd order them again. We got the green curry fried rice with duck and chicken pad thai. Both of those dishes were great, but the duck stole the show. That was some the of tastiest duck I've ever had. The pad thai was a bit sweet for us, so I think we'd try a different noodle dish when we return. But it was still very good, especially with some chili sauce mixed in. Our service was good, but other people had issues. One table was rushing to get to a show at the Kimmel Center and waited quite a while for their meal (and were going to be late). Another person who got take-out was missing one of their items (but the owner realized it and called him and walked the dish to his house, which was very nice). Overall, good quality Thai! We would definitely go back.",

I grew up in maryland and this location is just as good as the ones up there. the sauce is sweet, which i usually don't like, but they pull it off. its like pizza candy. this location brings down another taste from the north in the form of Boylan's Birch Beer and a couple others. i only really noticed the birch beer because its hard to find. A four pack is $6.49 or something. will be returning if i can make the 40 minute drive from clearwater again. open one closer to me please.",

    "text": "After moving to the area, Jungle Prada Tavern was one of the first places a friend took me.  The bartender made a great recommendation based on a beer I told her I liked and I loved it!  Now for the food- I LOVE seafood, so I am leary of ordering from places that don't do it justice, but alas, they impressed me thoroughly with all the seafood options I chose!!  The scallops prosciutto app, del mar pizza with crab and scallops, and crab stuffed portabella app (comes with a crab and lobster bisque- YUM) are all delicious!!  I also love the roasted portabella app- for a vegetarian option, it is delicious and was recomended by someone who isn't. I've actually gone back several times since then just to eat (obviously, I also drank ;) and took my sister when she was in town visiting (and is a seafood fanatic).  So all in all, give this place a chance!!  You will not be disappointed with the options!",

Today (7/29/11) in particular was a bit annoying: I frequently order iced-tea here, and love that I get a free refill.  I was not aware that there was a charge for a refill on iced-coffee.  The baristas were rude to me and I felt like an imbecile after my interaction.  I'd appreciate the following:  1.) Before pouring me a refill, it would have been nice to let me know it ain't free. 2.) If I express surprise at their being a charge, please don't tell me I don't have to have it.  3.) If I choose to have it because I don't want it to go to waste, please don't tell me \"It's not very good iced coffee\". If it's \"not good\", why the hell should I have to pay for a refill when I don't have to pay for a refill of the iced-tea that is delicious?",

Items ordered included Saganaki (flaming cheese), Taramosolata (Greek Caviar), Greek Salad, broiled octopus and a 3.5 lb fresh snapper.  We also had greek wine and several deserts from the attached bakery.  The place is huge and you really feel as if you are in Greece with the blue and white decor.  \n\nThe Taramosolata was arguably one of the best things I have eaten recently.  I had never had it and we actually ordered a second order.  I definitely recommend it.\n\nOther than that the food was very good but not outstanding.  I have been to Greece before.  The Saganaki was not as good as we've had at other places stateside, namely Detroit's greektown. The broiled octopus was cooked to the right texture but it could have used some  spices.  It was just sitting in olive oil with lemon wedges on the side.  The fish was superbly fresh and cooked well but when ordering a whole expensive fish I usually expect the waiter to serve it and help with the bone removal.  \n\nAlso I hesitate to say it but we were not blown away with our bakery selections.  The one exception was the Baklava which was outstanding.  \n\nOverall great place to go with friends or a group.  You will occasionally hear singing for a party and find yourself shouting opa!",

    "text": "I've only visited the Breadland Organic Whole Grain Bakery (breathes) to buy gluten-free bread. I was told by a girl that cut my hair that they have the best gluten-free bread and buns she has ever tasted. She said they were so good, that she ate six buns in a row. I was excited, when I heard this, because Kinnikinnick's bread is not very good. It's like eating bricks, and it took me years to get used to it; not to mention, it only really tastes good when it's toasted. \n\nI've tried Breadland's arrowroot gluten-free buns. These are indeed very good. They are very soft and the outside is chewy, and they taste great with just about anything: butter, hummus, melted cheese, or peanut butter & jam. The only problem is that I can't eat them, because they give me really bad eczema on my face. I suspect it's all the yeast they put in it. The focaccia gluten-free bread they sell is also really good. This is like a thick flat bread that is flavoured with tons of herbs and I think some garlic too. It's so good, and although it contains yeast, I don't get eczema, so it must not be that much. \n\nThese breads are very expensive though, so I only get them as a treat.",

When they opened up shop in Brewery town, I quickly bookmarked Spot and waited for a burger craving to hit me to give it a try.\n\nSpot is on West Girard Ave and I was able to find parking easily and close by on a Sunday night. The space is clean and bright with tables in the front, and back. There is also counter seating. There was some nice use of wood on the walls which gave Spot a cool urban vibe design.\n\nThe people that work at Spot were very friendly and helpful. They explained the specials and helped us with suggestions. I was surprised that Spot has other items such as Fish & Chips and Muscles in addition to burgers, sloppy Joe's, pulled pork and cheese steaks. Mental notes for my next visit.\n\nI went with the Spot burger; which had hickory smoked bacon, cheddar, pickles, coleslaw and Spot sauce. This was a great burger. The bun was excellent, fresh and toasted just right.  The burger was moist and juicy. The bacon was great and the slaw and sauce really made this one darn tasty burger. My daughter had the Santa Fe with Avocado, pepper jack cheese, jalape\u00f1o, red onion, sun dried tomatoes and a slightly spicy sauce. This was also a really good tasting burger! Spot really shines with their use unique toppings and sauces. \n\nWe ordered the plain fries too and these were crispy and not greasy. They were very good fries but Sketch still has my favorite fries. We had a couple of Fanta sodas too, which was pretty cool. All of our food came out surprisingly fast.\n\nSpot is very high up on my burger list and very close to Sketch. Spot lived up to the hype and is really cool little place in an up and coming section of the city. I will be back and probably soon. 4 plus Yelps.",

    "text": "We arrived in New Orleans on Christmas night ,just before 8:00 pm -- the first time, we realized, we've ever landed at night -- and quickly (I've *never* seen so little traffic on I-10!) made it to our hotel, the Le Meridien.\u00b9\n\nWe actually arrived at L\u00fcke for dinner a bit early, in terms of our reservation, but it was Christmas night and being seated early wasn't a problem. L\u00fcke, however, can itself have its share of problems .\n\n-- The front room can be (and often is) on the loud side, so much so that as a party of five at a rectangular table, it became difficult to hear. This is, of course, systemic and doesn't change. (The back room is quieter.)\n\n-- Bring Christmas night, I have to say both the kitchen and service were a bit \"off,\" but only in terms of timing -- NOT in terms of food (see below). Certain things came out almost too quickly; other things seemed to take forever. For example, L\u00fcke offered two types of oysters, and we ordered six of one, and a dozen of the other. The order of six came in a relatively timely fashion, but the 12 seemingly took forever, arriving long after the (cooked) appetizers were finished, and just before the entr\u00e9es. It also took a (relatively) long time to get the wine we ordered to accompany our entr\u00e9es. This, however, is more appropriately chalked up to Xmas night, rather than being \"the norm\" in our experience.\n\nThat said, the food was, as always, wonderful and delicious! The rabbit & chicken liver pate was silky smooth and satisfying; the brussels sprouts crispy and tasty; the crabmeat maison flavorful and tangy. The Drum was perfect, as were the shrimp & grits and the moules frites.\n\nL\u00fcke remains, for us, one of those places you can count on for good food and good drinks. It may not be our favorite place in New Orleans, but it always satisfies.\n_______________\n\u00b9 Formerly the Hotel New Orleans, formerly the W Downtown -- I guess it depends upon what day of the week it is.",

It was Karaoke night, and the locals sure did pull out their vocal chords and turn on their dancing feet. \n\nWe got a half-sized Victory Golden Monkey and a pint of Miller Lite for about $10 and just chilled here for an hour.

    "text": "My boyfriend and I both decided to try Jesse's for the first time after we'd both grown up in the Brandon area and neither of us had ever been, and really hadn't heard much about the restaurant. \n\nWe dined on a Saturday night and even though the parking lot and restaurant was packed, we were sat right away at a 2-top next to a window facing SR-60. \n\nOur server, Nikki, greeted us in a reasonable amount of time. We ordered our beverages and she brought them shortly after that. Something I did not like was there was not a drink menu on the table, but Nikki was able to tell us what beers were on draft and non-alcoholic drinks. She took our appetizer and entree order all at once. \n\nWe ordered crab stuffed mushrooms and a French onion soup to share. These items came out together. The crab stuffed mushroom was basically a giant thing of crab stuffing on a TINY mushroom, which was almost laughable, but had a good flavor nonetheless. The French onion soup had a great flavor and wasn't scalding hot, which was super nice to eat right away. \n\nAfter our appetizer came out and we finished it, our Caesar salads came out as well as a loaf of bread and some butter. This was also really great pacing of our meal! Nikki never let empty plates sit on our table, was very attentive, and always made sure we had drinks in front of us. The Caesar salads were good. I gave the bread two chances... once dipped in the French onion soup and once just with butter on it... the bread could have definitely been better - it just didn't have a good flavor to it. \n\nI ordered the 6 oz filet and he ordered the 16 oz Delmonico - both cooked medium rare. The steaks are served with saut\u00e9ed mushrooms, your choice of side, and a salad or soup of the day, which isn't mentioned anywhere on the menu. I got broccoli as my side and my boyfriend got a sweet potato with all the fixings. I saw three tables sat after us receive their entrees before us - I don't know if it was a kitchen issue or something else, but we were sat at least five minutes before each of those tables - I tried to make sense of the delay, but it honestly wasn't a big deal to me. Our steaks came out on hot metal plates that were inserted into a cooler outer shell. My filet was nice and thick and cooked perfectly and the broccoli was steamed very tenderly, but there were not enough saut\u00e9ed mushrooms on the plate, in my opinion. If I had known it would have been like five mushrooms with the steak, I totally would have gotten them as a side. My boyfriend's steak was cooked perfectly as well, but being on the hot metal dish led the steak to cook more at the table, which he wasn't particularly pleased with. He enjoyed his sweet potato with butter, but it didn't come out with cinnamon on it like he requested. \n\nAnyway, I am sure we will return! Our server, Nikki, was fabulous. She was extremely attentive, had a great attitude, and was knowledgeable!",

    "text": "Okay, so, this is a pizza place.  Unless you're Italian, which I am.  Then this is something completely different.  Different in a good way, in my opinion, but very far off traditional Italian pizza.  The crust is whole wheat, and slightly sweet, and the toppings range from typical American to wild and wacky -- I'm looking at you marinated tempeh!\n\nI like that Mellow lets you customize your own meal -- not just for pizza toppings, but also for salads.  The Build-Your-Own salad is a great idea that gives you endless opportunity for variety.   The salad size is AMPLE, the choice of toppings is exceptional, and the dressings are very good.\n\nI also like that Mellow has something for everyone.  They have gluten-free crust available, and I hear they are working on vegan cheese, if they don't have it already.  Lest your meativore cohorts get nervous when they see vegan cheese, tofu and tempeh on the menu, assure them that they also have the full range of carnivore-approved toppings.  No one need go away hungry.\n\nBut I can't forget to mention the very best thing about Mellow -- their beer selection.  They take their beer VERY seriously at Mellow and provide their beer-loving customers with an ever-changing selection of artisan brews, both on tap and in bottles.  It's a very good place to explore what beer can be, although you should be warned, some selections are not for the beer-timid.  Their knowledgeable barman will be willing to help you make a selection that will please your sensibilities.\n\nWhich brings me to the main reason I didn't give dear old Mellow a 5-star review: if you fall in love with a beer here, drink up, because it will in all likelihood be gone the next time you visit.  Also, the selection changes faster than the printed menu, so they are often out of the first choice you make.  Nearly every visit sees my waitress going to bar and returning empty-handed when a beer listed on the menu is no longer in stock.  Sometimes more than once.  One time, it took me 4 tries to choose a brew that was still available.  It's a niggling complaint, but a little more consistency would be nice.",

I came with my mother and we were looking for drinks and a quick bite to eat. We ended up going with the margarita flight and a quesadilla. The margaritas were amazing and the quesadilla was delicious. We ended up getting a second flight of margaritas because we couldn't settle on just one from the selection. Our waitress was sweet and attentive. She had a lot of recommendations both for drinks at Margaritaville and other places on the strip. Live music arrived about 20 minutes after we had and had a good sound and playful interactions with those in the bar. Our bill was approximately $50, which initially was shocking but I left happy, full, and feeling good from my drinks so it was worth it. Overall a nice experience; good drinks, food, and environment.",

The sweet red sauce that is on their pizza, the huge salad with the pepperoni, bacon, green peppers, red onions, mushrooms, and croutons, and the stuffed bread breadsticks are my faves. I actually have replicated the salad and sauce at home and am going to make the bread sticks some day. I just can't afford to eat there every week like I would like to! \n\nGia's is good at any time, but I love lunch in the early summer or late fall so I can sit outside and enjoy the weather and their lunch specials. \n\nIt's also a good place to watch games since they have lots of TV's. Not really good for groups of more than 6 or 8 due to the size. \n\nFor those of you who ate here when it was Papa Vito's, don't worry the menu hasn't changed. Also, for those of you who've tried Papa Vito's in Belleville since they opened, stick with Gia's Pizza. Easier to get to as far as parking and the one-way streets in Belleville, Gia's puts enough sauce on the pizza whereas Papa Vito's Belleville skimped on it, Gia's smells nicer and it's easier to get into the building carrying a baby at Gia's. (Guess I need to review Papa Vito's in Belleville next)\n\nThe only reasons I am giving them four stars and not five is because I can only rate the pizza, bread sticks and salad since that's all I ever get there.",

But on to the good why them deserve 4 stars. After having a not so great chimi I decided to try my own take and orders a side of grilled shrimp, lettuce, queso, tortillas and rice. I'm picky at times so I opted for a make my own kind of taco and for 8$ for rather large pieces of shrimp that come with 13 of those yummy boys I'm in heaven!

The only thing I don't like is the place is so small and so packed and when it's raining and cold you have to wait under the awning or in your car but you can't hear when it's your turn to be seated",

Can't get 5 stars without Luxardos if cocktails and food is your thing. That said I didn't peruse their beers on tap so maybe that's more of a focus.

However I was pleasantly surprised when a friend and I had lunch there.  The food is really good!  I had a BLT - made with rasher bacon on a baguette, it is a substantial sandwich, and the homemade potato chips were great.  With a beer menu that would make even the most pretentious beer snob happy, you really can't go wrong for a nice leisurely afternoon lunch.  The patio out back is nice, too.\nI can't say how it is late night - although it is packed every time I walk past it!",

This time we took my sister-n-law and her boyfriend who had been visiting us from England.  I shared a deep dish and my wife and her sister shared a thin crust.  All of us really enjoyed the pizzas of our choosing.  That is a great thing about Pi.  You can pick whatever style you want and also pick any pizza on their menu for your half. It makes sharing so easy!  \nWe were able to enjoy our pizzas outside on the sidewalk which made it even better.  The only problem was our waiter.  Not that he was a bad waiter, he just seemed to be trying to hard to be some type of character.  He also kept telling us how busy he was when he clearly was not.  \nTo me, Pi is St Louis' hometown pizza place.  (Not an Imo's fan! Provel???)",

    "text": "This was my first visit to 3 Sisters Cafe and I was not disappointed. I had just come out of a physical therapy appointment for my spouse down the road at Athletico and wanted a tasty, fast breakfast -- with FAST being the operative word here. \n\nI took a chance on 3 Sisters and it really paid off. We were in and out of there with great service in about 35 minutes total. It's a small place with friendly servers. I had a classic breakfast: 2 eggs, toast, and bacon. This was called \"The Don\" and came with potatoes but they swapped the taters for bacon at no additional cost. What an unexpected surprise! Everything was cooked to perfection: eggs over medium, wheat toast perfectly toasted, and crispy bacon. \n\nMy husband ordered a \"half\" order of pancakes which was a single giant pancake that took up literally the entire platter. He also had a side order of eggs. The portions were so generous that he wasn't able to finish it all despite having just worked up an appetite from the physical therapy. \n\nThe only thing I wish I could change is the acoustics in the place. I love that it's a converted old cottage house, but the echoes of nearby diners is pretty disruptive. There were only 4 groups of people counting us and it was pretty loud. We considered moving to their nice outdoor dining area but it's 85 and humid so we stayed put. \n\nI'll definitely be back with friends!",

I must say the chorizo was just a bit oily.  I was sad they didn't strain it a tad better.  The tortilla was also just a touch on the too chewy side.

A friend I met at the library conference, on the last day, RIGHT before we were about to head to the airport, said, \"Hey, have you guys tried The Range yet?\" \n\nHooray for her!  I like burgers and fries as much as the next person, but generally I don't find them a super exciting food.  I would come back here to try more!  Everything is home made (the Sriracha!  The pickles!  The buns!), and reaaaally tasty.  The burger patty was flavorful and tasted like something my mom would make, and I got a fried macaroni and cheese patty on top of my burger.  Yes, a fried mac and cheese patty ON my burger.  \n\nI also love the gigantic list of soda from all around the world (I got black cherry cream soda!), and I wish I had been hungry enough to check out some of the homemade ice cream shakes.  Yummm. \n\nThe atmosphere is cool too, with lots of random quirky decorations, painted milk jugs hanging from the ceiling, windows hung in a gigantic mosaic between the dining room and the kitchen, and more.  The only thing that made me lower this from a five to a four star rating was that they were suuuper under staffed, and things were kinda slow.  The server was really sweet about it and great, but it did take us forever to get our food (and we were huuungry).",

Long line and nobody taking names. We left. \n\nThe margarita was great. I had the cilantro chicken enchiladas. Also great! The outdoor seating area was very pleasant under the umbrellas on a lovely Saturday afternoon. \n\nOverall, I liked it. They just need a bit more time to figure out the flow. I'm thrilled to see something affordable move into my neighborhood. The prices are very reasonable and this place isn't trying to be \"casual fancy\" like the last two train wrecks that occupied this space.\n\nHope Loco thrives for years to come!",

I did two scrambled eggs with chopped up basil folded in, hash-browns, and biscuits with apricot jam. The eggs were incredible! Fluffy yet firm, but not overcooked. The basil was a perfect addition to fill out the flavor of otherwise bland eggs. The biscuits were pretty much out of this world. I'm going to say they were the best biscuits I've ever had. And the jam?! Oh the jam. Don't even get me started! The hash-browns on the other hand feel short. Not much flavor, soft, and sort of cold. I asked for them well done, but that didn't really happen, and that bummed me out a little. \n\nService was a little off too. It was busy- CRAZY busy, so I imagine they were strapped to get people seated and get food in their mouths timely, but I had to wait a little longer for a server to come over. Once he took my order though everything moved along like clock work. And so I'll hit em up again, it was breakfast well done. And next time I'll make sure the hash-browns are well done too!",

    "text": "I've been to both locations, here and Center City. The only difference I noticed between the two was the music at this location was obnoxiously loud, but the important thing was the food was consistent. Below is my review of the Center City location, really don't have anything different to say:\n\n\"Very hip vibe. You order either a salad or stir fry meal via a touch screen monitor (just like at wawa, for those familiar). I like to build my own, but they have several standard options to pick as well. \n\nMy only gripe is it was a bit light on meat. You can add more meat when ordering, but I would have liked a bit more with the regular order. Speaking of which, be careful when adding veggies on the build your own, after 3 you incur a $0.35 charge. Not a huge cost, but it can add up if you don't pay attention. \n\nAll the produce is local, which is great, but wouldn't necessarily bring me into or keep me away from a place. I just like that it is good, fresh, healthy food. Will definitely be back.\"",

Seated promptly, order taken by a very nice waitress.\n\nThey rearranged the entry for (presumably) more seating.  We had a seat very close to the door and it was rather cold - not the end of the world.  Ordered the spinach melt with fries, daughter went with a cheeseburger and fries.\n\nMelt was very good - larger in size, served on nice bread with tomato.  Fries were hot and fresh and what I would describe as \"Shoestring boardwalk style\".  Not a fan.  Too little potato and too much grease.  Sort of like the basket filler you get at a Long John Silver's.  Daughter liked them though - she had half of mine.\n\nNoticed that the Roost was listed as a place to visit (!) from a customer who was in town on business.  Not sure what it says about Fishers in general, but he went there for breakfast on our recommendation and really enjoyed as well.\n\nGood local place - suitable for breakfast and lunch.

Good soup, excellent fresh side salad with great ranch dressing and the crab plate was huge, plenty of crab for one person. They had great service, beautiful location (it literally sits out on the end of the pier with outdoor seating). The only reason I give this four stars is there was nothing on the menu that did not have seafood. My poor husband got the side salad and we had to go somewhere else to get him food.

    "text": "Underrated burger alert!!\n\nRandomly came into Pag's during a stroll around Doylestown. The menu wasn't super appealing, actually, so I just went with a cheeseburger. Legitimately, one of the best cheeseburgers I've had in a while! Tasted like a quality Big Mac! Patty wasn't too thick, bun didn't overshadow the burger and whatever sauce they used - YUM.\n\nWe were in the wine bar section - ambiance is really nice; def not very kid friendly (we had our son with us.) but staff was friendly and accommodating.\n\nWe will totally be back next time we are in the mood for a good burger!",

    "text": "I decided to stop by since I was in the area and craving some authentic Mexican cuisine. I was literally by myself (late lunchtime on a tues) and really excited to try the pazole!! It was delicious ( granted my first and only time) I believe it's pork and has hominy, lettuce, radishes,onions and they give you a small container of dried oregano. Not the biggest fan of the lettuce cause it's gets all wilted but add some hot sauce and it's a meal in itself!!! I got also got the taco lunch special (2 pork tacos and rice) and that was good. Besides the amazing service from the sweet lady, the salsa was way sweet! Wasn't the biggest fan but everything is def fresh! And the pineapple water is a must. I don't like pineapples but I read reviews and just had to try it and thank u guys! Great reviews :) I'm excited to come back to try the burritos esp since I come out here for Costco shopping (soooo close by!) pretty dangerous when I find good food cause then I get cravings :/ enjoy this gem and eat up!!!",

    "text": "I'd heard the hype. Seen the NY Times article. Nevertheless I was skeptical. Mainly because most people have at best, two reference points for donuts, Dunkin Donuts or Krispy Kreme. Neither of which really makes truly great donuts.  So after waiting for the crowds to die down a little, I traveled over to see for myself last Saturday.\n\nIt's a small shop that blends into the surrounding neighborhood. Inside there are a couple of seats at the counter and a wide window well that two people could sit in. I ordered my donuts. I went with the Indian Cinnamon, the caramel banana, the pina colada, and the halva pistachio. The ladies behind the counter worked as fast as they could given the decent sized collection of people waiting for orders and bopping in. My order was processed quickly, and I got my coffee right after I ordered it. The coffee was one of the only things that was a disappointment besides the lack of seating.\n\n Since there was no room to sit, much less stand I took my donuts and coffee out to a park just off of Federal between 3rd and 4th St.\nThe donuts were truly transcendant.  Each donut was a symphony of flavors on my tongue.\n\nThe Indian Cinnamon-Very light on the cinnamon, coated with sugar. Hot, fresh, and so moist that it pinched in half when I started to eat it.\n\nThe caramel banana-A delicious meld of flavors with something added to the banana chips that made them more tasty than I\"d imagined.\n\nThe pina colada-The donut I though I'd enjoy the least. However it tasted like the Rach 3 and Beethoven's 9th all rolled up. A complex mix of flavors that together was truly amazing. And unlike the current generations, I don't use that term lightly.\n\nThe halva and pistachio-the final movement. More subtle flavors that nevertheless worked well. I'd never had halva before, but I liked it.\n\nBelieve the hype. Believe the NY Times article. Federal Donuts makes some of the best donuts I've had.",

We stumbled across this place and decided to give it a shot. We sat in the restaurant area since I'm underage, but I liked the atmosphere. Our waitress was really nice as well.\n My dad liked the beer and I liked the food. I got the pulled pork sandwich with collard greens. The portions were huge. I've never had barbeque made with vinegar sauce but I really liked it. For dessert, I ordered the Red Velvet Cupcake. Now, I'm from Southern California and I have tried red velvet before, but I couldn't understand what the fuss was about. I decided to give it another try since I was on the east coast. Best. Decision. Ever. I finally understood what Red Velvet is supposed to taste like. It was delicious! I felt like my sight had been restored and I could finally see what I had been missing out on. \nI was surprised to find such a great place so close to our hotel.

Next time, I would get it spicier. Lots of beef in it though, they definitely did not skimp on that.\n\nMy parents both ate Pad Thai and loved it. I snagged a bite of my mom's Chicken Pad Thai and it was pretty yummy. I prefer greasy spicy noodles though.\n\nThe desserts here are so so good. A bit overpriced maybe ($6 a piece), but delicious. I had the sticky mango rice, my mother ate the chocolate banana egg roll, my brother had the banana tempura. All yummy.  My dad clearly made the right choice when he ordered the coconut ice cream. It came in half a coconut and there was SO MUCH ICE CREAM. I dont' know if they make it on location, or if they get it elsewhere, but I could definitely eat it every day.\n\nI'm going to drag my brother here for the rest of the time he's at UPenn.

You'll find bagels, donuts, and (MmmMmm) you'll find coffee... I'll ignore the sandwiches for now.\n\nFOOD\nWith a word like \"bagel\" in the title, I expected the bagels to blow me away. With around 20 types of bagels-- they are DELICIOUS to eat without additions or toasting, but don't expect to substitute your New York plane tickets for these. I'm a donut fan and these are a hit or miss. If it has thick frosting, the frosting BREAKS APART from the donut in chunks! Noooo! But if the frosting has been glazed on, it was done so with love and partly melts into the donut dough which makes it delicious. \n\nAh coffee--although some types are served a bit small for the price--MmmMmmm. Awesome, many choices. It complements the dough-ness of the food and comes in many forms. A side area allows for self-service. \n\nSERVICE\nThe employees run the place like a corporate business: serious, brisk, unsmiling. The quick service is awesome as well as the acknowledgement upon entry... but it doesn't seem like these guys get buddy-buddy with anybody. I'm assuming they have cult fans--I've seen ALL types of people go here. ALLLLL freakin' types. (That's a good thing)\n\nLOCATION APPEARANCE\nThe store blends into the not-so-pretty plazas of St. Pete's 4th Street. Worn out signs outside, dusty parking lot... stark contrast from the comfiness that seems to radiate nuclear energy from inside. Cool-- at the side you can watch a baker creating the pastries for the store.",

    "text": "I enjoyed Grand Isle so much that I came back twice during my one week stay in New Orleans!  Highly recommend sitting right up at the bar so you can watch the oysters being shucked - very cool!\n\nTrip One:\nIt was my first night in New Orleans and I was starving!  I went on Yelp to see what was around my hotel and noticed that Harrah's casino was right across the street.  Having been the Harrah's in Atlantic City several times (more times than I'd like to admit), I knew that there had to be good restaurants associated with the casino.  I strolled into Grand Isle around 7pm on a Tuesday night, and thankfully it wasn't busy.  I took a seat at the bar and ordered my first local beer - the Nola Blonde.  For an appetizer, I ordered the shrimp gumbo - how touristy of me!  It was really good!  Everything shrimp gumbo should taste like.  For dinner, I decided on the house made gator sausage po boy.  OH MY GOD amazing!  The flavors worked so well together and the gator sausage was delicious.  I knew instantly that I'd be getting this again before I headed back to PA.\n\nI'm not sure if martinis were on special that night, but I saw a ton of them being ordered.  The ladies next to me got louder and more hilarious as the night went on, so I'm assuming the martinis were pretty good haha.\n\nTrip Two (two days after trip one):\nMy boyfriend arrived in New Orleans and I told him I had to take him to a few, great restaurants I had tried earlier in the week.  We headed over to Grand Isle!  For an appetizer, we got the Isle Sampler of oysters.  All of them were delicious, but the oysters fulton (with bacon, cheddar, and onions) was my favorite.  So good!  For entrees, I once again ordered the gator sausage po boy and my boyfriend got the shrimp caminada po boy (which had apparently won an award at the po boy festival in the past year or two).  You've already read my review about the gator po boy, so let me tell you about the shrimp caminada:  IT WAS DELICIOUS.  Asian herb slaw was amazing and the shrimp was plentiful.  I can see why this won awards.\n\nWe spoke with the bartender a little bit, who was a super nice guy.  Turns out he's from NJ, so it was nice to run into someone from our homeland.\n\nIn short:  Go to Grand Isle.  Get some oysters, shrimp caminada po boy, the gator po boy, and a lot of beer (and maybe some martinis? haha).  You won't be disappointed!",

We went for breakfast and we will be back another time soon for lunch. \n\nA duster restaurant to burg bar & grill, this gem had a ton of breakfast and lunch options with some added Greek flare and a touch of Cuban dishes. To this native Floridian it's the fun options you'd expect to see at a local diner. \n\nI got the mama mias eggs Benedict which included spinach and mushrooms. I selected crispy hash browns as my side and it also came with a banana and strawberry. It was so good I wish there was less hollandaise since it was so good it didn't need that much. \n\nThe guys got the Hungry Greek and an omelet and we were all happy. Choices between potatoes, hash browns and grits ensured there were options for everyone.  A banana and strawberry for everyone too.  \n\nPortions were large, prices good and the choices abundant. \n\nWe had Aly as our waitress and she was great! Friendly and awesome some recommendations. \n\nCheck this place out for sure!",

    "text": "I have been trying to come here for what seems like an eternity, but there was always something in the way.  (Like the one day when I was \"finally going to eat there\" and as we walked up there was a sign on the door stating that because of malfunctions in the kitchen, they were only serving drinks and cold food.  Needless to say, I didn't go in that day)  Finally, the stars aligned and I was able to eat here.  And I'm happy I did.\n\nI went in with two friends after getting our nails done and sat at a table.  We ordered drinks, truffled cauliflower, and an order of tater tots.  They put the tater tots closest to me and I can't control myself, so no one else at the table got tater tots.  They were really good.  I ordered the burger without the thousand island dressing and with cheddar and caramelized onions.  That was a GOOOOOOOOOOOD burger.  Cooked perfectly, juicy, and the roll was soft and pillowy.  It didn't last long on my plate.  We got an order of duck fat french fries for the table and while they were good, I think I liked the tater tots better and would probably order them as our side next time. \n\nMy only issue with Village Whiskey is the space.  It's so small.  They crammed the three of us into a space that really was built for two people.  After we left, each one of us realized that our legs were cramped and sore from trying to squeeze into that tight spot.  Maybe next time, and there will be a next time, I might consider asking for a bigger table.   (Do they even have bigger tables? I was so enamored with my food, I didn't look around too much)",

    "text": "Went in about 10pm on a Saturday night, no wait - the place was pretty empty.  We had very prompt, attentive service.  Get ready, their drink menu is really impressive and extensive!  \n\nFood:  \n\nMe - LGBT Burger - Goat cheese, bacon. \n\nMy son - Daves Smoked - Cold smoked patty, fontina cheese caramelized onions\n\nthe BF - Ozark - mushrooms, black peppered goat cheese caramelized onions\n\nMy son's friend - The Basic - basic burger - +$1 for cheese\n\nAll of the burgers were EXCELLENT.  I can only speak for myself, so first of all, all of our food came out HOT, the buns are made in-house and were delicious.  super tasty, nicely toasted and crispy yet soft - i wanted to take some home with me.  The combination of the goat cheese and bacon with the burger was perfect.  I loved it.  It did not need anything else.  I did put some of the chipotle sauce that came with our fries (separate purchase) and it was pretty good, but not necessary.  Burgers were a pretty good size - they were smaller than the bun, but still a good size.  Worth the price?  Sure, this was a quality burger!  My only gripe, however is that the price did not include fries (see below).\n\nNo one left a morsel on their plates.  My son's friend ate so fast we actually thought he was a little strange...no one should eat that fast...\n\nSides:  We ordered two large french fries ($4 each) to share between four people and it was exactly enough.  You have a choice of \"sauces.\"   I was not impressed at all - they were just fries, and honestly with burgers starting at about $8 these fries should come with the burgers.  I need to have french fries with my burger, so I will pay every time, but suggest that they re-think this item and make them worth the price and at least make something worth the price like  garlic fries.  These are NOT worth the extra $2-$4.\n\nWe also had the Cheese Curds - ok not what I was expecting but it was good.  Not sure what kind of cheese it was but it went really well with the mustard and apples - the bread/crackers however were a nightmare almost funny - they crumbled because they were so thin!  Almost like lace.  They really should be a little thicker.  Again, it was good, but c'mon please be a little more generous with the thickness of the bread/cracker.  \n\nThe boys had ice cream, but I won't comment because I did not taste it.  I was too full from the burger.  Hope to on the next trip.  \n\nOverall, we had a great time.  Service was stellar, the place itself is very cute, but I can see how it may be a little awkward if it's packed, especially sitting at the communal table.   Next time we are in St. Louis we will definitely be making a return trip to Bailey's Range!",

They sit you down with a good sized menu, and you get to order whatever you want, as much as you want. They prefer if you start out with an appetizer or something, because the sushi is made to order, and depending on how busy it is (every table was occupied at noon today), you'll have a bit of a wait for it. The lunch was $9.99 per person. I don't know how you can possibly beat that! I did not care for the ginger dressing on my salad. It tasted quite bitter to me. I also didn't really care for my tempura banana. It was more of a texture thing for me. Once a banana gets heated up, it gets very mushy. Everything else was delicious. Items we ordered include shrimp shumai, gyoza, clear soup, house salad, edamame, tempura banana, Fuji roll, Hawaii roll, California roll, Alaskan roll, Philadelphia roll, and Green Sarabay roll.",

    "text": "Couple of notable impressions:\n\n- The first thing that got me was the decor of the place. Chopsticks were made out of red plastic, and the napkin was just paper, not cloth. Water came out in glass cups. The impression was overall a little cheap, which surprised me. On the other hand, the servers did keep water refilled well and tea was presented immediately.\n\n- A lot of the reviews remark that the dishes are very spicy. I was surprised to discover it was pretty tame. The Dan Dan noodles come in at a 6 and it was imperceptible. We got another dish coming in at an 8 which also was hard to notice. Not sure what the explanation might be since I don't consider myself to be especially tolerant, but perhaps I'm more so than I think?\n\n- Service was very fast. I think our food came out within ten minutes. Certainly the Dan Dan noodles were instantaneous.\n\n- Finally, the food itself is delicious. The Dan Dan noodles especially. I also had some kind of dumplings and an entree, I unfortunately can't remember the names, but both were enjoyable as well.\n\n- The bill was a bit pricey. I think they give a lot of food for two, so it's may be justified, just unwanted for two relatively small people. Fortunately, they make taking it home easy if that's something you'd like.\n\nEDIT:\n\n- After visiting a second time with a large group, I discovered they have a very nice seating area for groups (to the right and somewhat below ground). We got a circular table which I really liked for discussion. Definitely would have appreciated a turntable, but no big deal.\n\n- A tip from our server: the spice tends to be the kind that creeps up rather than is entirely overt. Besides water, consuming tea and rice helps to reduce the effect of the spice.",

    "text": "Cafe Beignet and Musical Legends Park offers a great reprieve from the hustle and bustle of Bourbon Street. If you're still looking to drink while listening to some live jazz, the bar has got you covered with cocktails and alcoholic slushes. \n\nMy boyfriend and I popped by on a Monday night around 8pm for some beignets to compare to the ones we had over at Cafe Du Monde. Beignets here are $3.99 for three. We ordered pretty quickly and were able to snag one of the few empty tables. While the service was incredibly slow, we found ourselves mostly distracted by music and just basking in the ambience. \n\nThe beignets were fantastic- came freshly fried and hot with healthy dustings of powered sugar. I would have liked more sugar, but it was perfect for my boyfriend. We also got a southern comfort mango slush to share, which was pretty good and felt solidly packed with alcohol.",

    "text": "All of the previous reviews are fairly spot-on. This is a little hole-in-the-wall place. It has a definite Mom and Pop feel. The decor is ok.\nI had the Potato Skins as an appetizer. Wow, that was a huge order! They could have been heated a little more, but I can't complain otherwise.\nFor my entree, I went with my personal benchmark, Chicken Fried Steak. The portion was huge, and I'm pretty sure it was hand-breaded, and likely in their fried chicken breeding. This is a GOOD thing. In addition, it came with two sides. Green beans were delicious and bacony, and the 4-cheese Mac and Cheese was good...and a little kick of heat!\nOverall, this isn't fine dining by any stretch. But it's good basic homestyle.\nI will return...if I ever stop feeling so stuffed!!",

Has a hole-in-the-wall look, especially from the outside, but is actually quite deep and spacious. Quaint French cafe feel. The waiters were friendly and the beignets just right. Also had a pretty good crawfish omelette. Perfect breakfast spot. Once you get to Cafe du Monde and realize what a scam it is, be sure to come here instead!",

The place is open 24/7\nThe ATMS are no surcharge (yes!!!)\nThey place really, really cool music!\n\n(OK, so I just glanced over at Simon E.'s review of this same WaWa and he says the vibe is upbeat, and that is def. true!  Friendly staff who seem happy to work there!  And getting a wave in the ALWAYS packed parking lot is indeed a common occurrence.)\n\nGripes:  Parking.  I never even try to park in the front lot anymore.  I either walk to WaWa, or if I am driving, I park in the back lot.  Yes, WaWa has a second lot, behind the store.  Almost always an open spot.  Often times, there is 5-10 open spots back there.  \n\nGripes continued:  Often there are panhandlers.  Not really WaWa's fault, I mean we are talking Germantown Ave, in Philadelphia proper, it is a reality.  There have not been any aggressive panhandlers since 2014, so this is not a concern really any longer.\n\nMajor points for:  \n*seasonal specialties!  I look forward to autumn for the pumpkin cannoli dip and chips!  I also dig the apple cider donuts and to a lesser degree the pumpkin donuts.  \n*Prices!  Everything is reasonable!  Some stuff is cheap!\n*Selection!  Good choice for candy, chips, snacks, healthy snacks/protein bars, drinks, etc.\n*For the MASSIVE VOLUME that the store does, the lines usually move very fast and efficiently, and 2nd registers open up lightning fast when they are needed!\n*The store is clean from my point of view.  It is a busy, busy store, but I never see any mess on the floor or coffee station or food station.\n\nI do not eat any of the hot food.  Low quality, I steer clear.  \n\n\nFor a convenience store that is open 24 hours, WaWa is awesome!  \n\nDoes this one have a bathroom?  I never used it, I never checked....but maybe there is no bathroom for customers there!  Maybe it is around back?  Hmmm.  I would avoid using it anyway.  \nAlso, this WaWa could never have gas pumps, traffic is already congested between Allens Lane and Mt. Airy Avenue along Germantown Ave.  (Between WaWa and the Bank of America on the corner.)\nOverall:  This place is awesome based on the music selection and friendly staff working 24/7.  This store does a lot right!",

So why the 4 stars and not 5? Well the staff of 3 were sitting at a table right by the register, and they all looked miserable.

I've never been at night so it could be quite good as a bar to frequent.\n\nThat said their breakfast was OK, nothing to write home about - in fact there's a cafe right across the street (cafe lift) and I would argue they have a much more tasty brunch option. That said this place definitely has great options for watching games and seating with groups at a bar.",

But a small cooking accident and a burned hand lead me to order out at this South Chinese/Vietnamese place, and I was pretty satisfied with the result.\n\nMy order was hot and freshly ready in just under ten minutes; I barely had time to hit an ATM around the corner. It wasn't super cheap; I paid for two dishes what I would have paid for three at the cheapest of such places, but the portion sizes were such that I'll get 2.5-3 meals anyway, which is about right for the price. And it was respectable American Chinese cuisine, with my Kung Pao dish highlighted by a mix of vegetables and a decent amount of peanuts, and my lemongrass tofu having the option of noodles or rice with a little salad and separate sauce on the side. Nothing world-beating (and if I wanted to, I could get mad at them for their spicy dishes not being particularly hot), but I got a good meal.\n\nFor some reason it came in styrofoam containers rather than the typical Chinese food cartons, and I was instructed to hold the bag level to avoid spillage; even being cautious, there was still a bit of sauce on the bottom of the bag. If they wanted five stars from me, they could do things like improve those containers or not sneak broccoli into dishes where it isn't listed or offer non-soy vegetarian dishes for variety, but their menu now isn't bad.\n\nTheir online menu proudly proclaims that the dishes in its vegetarian section are \"prepared with vegetarian ingredients\", which sounds redundant until you realize that Chinese places can and will sneak in something that isn't. So I appreciate that notification, and will most likely order something else from that menu the next time I decide I want Chinese takeout.",

However, the man and woman behind the counter are very rude and it's a shame becuase the owner seems like such a nice man. They have ignored customers standing in a long line to hold conversations and move extremely slow as if no one has anywhere to go. Don't bother calling an order ahead becuase chances are they won't answer the phone during breakfast hours.",

My favorites include dulce de leche, stracciatella, marscapone, lemon, caramel and the test of any great gelato maker chocolate. I have never had a bad flavor here and the staff are more than generous in letting you sample the flavors to make your decision. You can mix 2-3 flavors depending on the size you get as well. They also have solid coffee-fu and make a mean espresso. \n\nIt is also a really nice mellow space to hang out in with lots of dark wood and a pressed tin ceiling (I am a total sucker for these); I like to play boardgames there with friends. There is a nice outdoor seating area now as well with a gate through which you can bring your canine companions to lounge with you (or I suppose felines on a leash). \n\nA great dessert to follow a meal on South Grand or just as a destination in itself. Plus it saves me from having to haul downtown and I can walk to it, which is beyond awesome.",

    "text": "Joey B's is a very comfortable neighborhood bar offering some pretty solid food.  We stopped in this past weekend.  I was looking for a place to get late night grub and that also had a Golden Tee machine.  I was suprised to find out that their full menu was available until midnight (at least on Saturday) and that they offer pizza until the bar closes.  We tried the buffalo chicken pizza.  It was a tad bit expensive for a thin crust pizza with minimal toppings but it was very yummy.  We also orderd the shrimp diablo pasta.  The shrimp were perfect.  The angel hair pasta was just ok.  \n\nWhoever takes care of the place does a good job.  Everything is neat, orderly, in place and confortable.  \n\nOur server was awesome.  Unfortunately some idiots pull a chair right in the middle of the walkway so she had to navigate through the restaurant to get to the other side of the bar.  \n\nOnly drawbacks were that whoever was playing music on the jukebox was playing crappy songs (not really their fault), and that the Golden Tee machine wasn't accepting money.  I'm sure to revisit.",

    "text": "I was shopping at WinCo long before I moved to Reno 3 years ago. As far as I'm concerned it's the only supermarket chain in town.  Like one other reviewer said I do stop at Trader Joe's  when I go do a major shopping trip because of their somewhat different produce selections and their wonderful whole wheat bread offerings.  \n\nI use a lot of nuts to try to stay healthy and I love the bulk department for those because I can buy them in large or small quantities at a low price. I also use many other products from this department: whole wheat pasta, dry beans and veggies, chips and the wonderful no sugar chocolates.\n\nIt was interesting when the store recently opened a fresh sushi bar. I, like many others, was very happy to see it. \n\nI dinged them one star because of the fact that if you are there at a busy evening you might find little kids running up and down the isles and playing Nerf football in the open areas.  Parents from this part of town who are doing their shopping should keep their children with them and under control.\n\nI actually prefer shopping at WinCo South as that problem does not seem to exist there.",

    "text": "3.50 stars.  \n\nGabby's wasn't open.  I knew that.  Neither was Rotier's.  But my handy Yelp app had assured me that Fido's was open.  Imagine the disappointment when I realized there was a very real possibility that no burgers would happen on this trip down to the Deep South.  Would I really have to wait two more weeks when I would find solace in East Texas?   \n\n\"We can try Burger up,\" I mentioned.  \n\n\"Why don't you just call them?\" hissed the appropriately nicknamed Viper.  \n\nTrue.  We didn't have to keep driving around aimlessly.  So I call Burger Up, and a very pleasant, sweet voice assures me they are indeed open.  \n\nViper: \"What was her name?  She sounded hot.\"\n  \nMe: \"Paige.\"\n\nViper: \"Yeah, she's definitely hot.  Have you ever met an unattractive Paige?\"\n\nMe: \"Good point.  At least we have that going for us.\"\n\nPaige was indeed attractive, but this review isn't about a photogenic individual who happens to work at Burger Up.  It's about what ended up being a visit to our fourth choice for burgers in Nashville.  \n\nBurger Up follows a national trend towards upscale burgers.  My particular order consisted of a medium rare patty served with aged cheddar, Benton's bacon (very good), and ketchup served on an artisan bun.  Basically, it was a gussied up bacon cheeseburger, but it was a rather tasty one.  My major complaint is that I wish the actual meat itself exhibited more flavor.  Having said that, the burger was cooked properly and the flavors worked well together.  I ordered some wilted spinach on the side (mediocre) and truffle fries.  Let's talk about those truffle fries for a bit.  I know more people are apparently into the sweet potato fries here, but I think they are missing the boat.  Burger Up's truffle tries have pleasant aroma, taste great, and are the perfect texture for soaking up oil.  If you are on a diet, it is true you should skip these delightful fries.  But if that were the case, why are you at a burger joint in the first place?  Seriously, if you get nothing else out of my review, please do yourself a favor and order the truffle fries.  \n\nBurger Up also boast an interesting beer menu with semi-obscure breweries from the Deep South included in the list.  I tried a pecan-infused amber from Mississippi - not bad.  I could imagine Burger Up could be a decent place to drink for a bit after eating.  \n\nIf I attended Vanderbilt, I would probably go here on a moderately frequent basis.  If you want a change from the dive bar hamburger, Burger Up is a decent change of pace.",

We checked in on a Sunday afternoon, and it was really quick. The rep was knowledgeable and friendly and gave instructions on how to find our room. The room was the cheapest they had, but still really nice, and very clean. We dropped our stuff off and explored. There is so much to see and so much to do. Some of the activies are free, like the fountain show in the evenings, but most aren't, such as the riverboat ride or the spa services. \nDinner our first night was at the Cantina. Prices are decent, and the service was good. Our second night we ate at Piaso (pizza). The pizza was good, for the price. Generous servings for $4. Friendly service and a decent selection of wines. There are at least three coffee houses that I counted, and all serve Starbucks coffee. \nThere are three pools - one indoor and two outdoor. The Cascades Outdoor Pool has already 1.5' small pool that was perfect for our three year old, and the larger pool went up to 4'6\" which was great for our 8 year old. There is a great locker room by the Cascades Indoor Pool that has showers, a hair dryer, and restrooms. \nOverall my family and I had a great time, and I don't regret the money we spent for the two nights we were here (which was a lot). Just do your research, and take the time to see the scenery. It is breathtaking!",

I'm glad I did! They were outstanding.",

So what makes this one stand apart?\n\nThe variety of gyro toppings/meat choices/sauces isn't staggering, but definitely impressive nonetheless.  A gyro with hot sauce?  SIGN ME UP!  It was called the gyro picanti and it was the most scrumptious meat treat I can remember ever eating.  The presentation is tight and it is perfectly layered to make each bite complex.  The hot sauce plays off the tzatziki as if it was meant to be (think blue cheese and wings).  \n\nWhile the gyro was inspired, the pasta salad was nothing to write home about and this is clearly a take-out place as their is nothing inviting you to stay and sit.  You have to get your own silverware and such.  \n\nWinner, winner gyro dinner.",

However, the little bear plate was simple, yet delicious and paired nicely with a side of savory whey grits.

That must be the $26 burger that I didn't have (mainly because I'm not a fan of bleu cheese, and I didn't want to be \"that guy\" to ask for a different cheese) because the Village Burger was good, but not exceptional.\n\nI got the \"Village Burger\" (8oz, Sesame Roll, Tomato, Boston Bibb, House Made Thousand Island) with bacon and provolone (+$3). It was huge, could hardly fit in my mouth huge, and delicious, but I don't think I can call it the best burger in all of Philadelphia.\n\nThe duck fat fries were great. They were big, crispy, and hot on the inside. I'm going to get the sly fox cheddar sauce with them next time.\n\nThe whiskey list is HUGE. \n\nIt's so small inside they don't have \"sections\" for the waitresses (or it might have been because only the bar and outside seating were busy). There's the bar that seats maybe eight people, though I didn't count (it was full), four or five booths (completely empty at 5:30pm), and a little counter that seats five or six in the back (empty as well). There's more seating outside than inside. After paying one waitress, another asked if I wanted another beer. I'm not sure if it's a plus that there's always someone checking on you, or a negative because they're unorganized? \n\n I'll come back, but my main goal will be to try the extensive whiskey list, not a burger.",

    "text": "When giving friends from out of town a tour of the French Quarter, one can only expect they want some classic New Orleans dishes. I've been here a couple of times, but they were the ones that wanted to go, due to their lunch special. It's a nice, well know restaurant that offers a 17.00 lunch special that includes a soup or salad, entree, and the option for a 4.00 Bloody Mary or martini. I got the Bloody Mary and it was a great size for the price. It was spicy and hit the spot.\nThey text message you when your table is ready, so were able to walk around the quarter while we waited. Thank god a lot of restaurants are getting rid of the those buzzers that make you feel like you are under house arrest. \nWe sat down to a beautiful table right by the open shutters. The servers, were ok. They were busy, but forgot a couple of things we asked for. It was still a great experience though!\nI got the pork chop with red beans and the turtle soup. The turtle soup was one of the best I have had. The pork chop was cooked to perfection and the read beans were seasoned very well. It came with cornbread, but it was very dry. After this lunch at noon, I didn't find myself hungry till it was basically time for bed. It was a very generous portion and well worth the money.\n\nMuriel's is a great way to get a classic, good quality New Orleans meal at a decent price. The location is spectacular, and the history behind the restaurant made for great conversation at the table.\nDefinitely check it out if you are in the Quarter!",

The pool alone deserves its own review. Lovely, lovely views and two jacuzzis along with a poolside bar makes me -- and others -- very happy. And you can rent out a cabana and get the special treatment. I like that you are actually able to close each of the drapes in the cabanas and have nearly full privacy. \n\nSo, this casino is still relatively new. It opened November 11, 2011. What that means is that you don't walk into the place and find that your entire body is cutting the cigarette smoke and smoke residue. \n\nYou know what I'm saying. \n\nHave you ever been in one of those old timey casinos? Maybe in Vegas? You walk in and the cigarette smoke is so thick you can literally feel it on your skin, sitting on your eyelashes and glazing your eyeballs? \n\nBleeccchhhhttt!!!\n\nMoving on in the review. \n\nSo, yes -- everything is still shiny. And they have some very nice restaurants. I like Mr. Ans and PY the best of the, what, five restaurants they have here. Also, the bar areas are very nice. Trusted there is absolutely no way to get away from the clanks, dings and swirling sounds from the machines. That's OK. Just come along with a date or someone you are so entralled with and you will never notice. \n\nBut -- what?! No taste on the wine?! Fail! Also, the room service can be so, so slow sometimes. But some of the other positives make up for it. \n\nSo, yes -- I enjoy this spot and look forward to my next night over.",

On my last visit with friends, our waitress Meredith was busy and a bit overwhelmed but she was genuinely apologetic for our wait for food and was great despite being spread too thin.\n\nThe house salad is a must meal starter, the green onion, salami and provel are nice differences from typical house salads you see elsewhere. The house dressing in creamy but not too heavy. \n\nThe firecracker chicken sandwich has a nice kick but the real star here are the burgers. Joey B's knows what they're doing with the house burger - topped with lightly-battered fried onions and soft cheddar cheese, cooked to order. The pizzas and pastas always look great and I need to diverge from a burger to give one of these other options a whirl on my next visit.\n\nThey're heavy with the sides - mountains of fries and onion rings the size of hubcaps. Greasy greasy good.",

    "text": "I frequent the Rittenhouse Square area often as an old friend runs a bar down the street, and have passed Porcini's many times. Having had a date last Saturday, I thought it would have been a good opportunity to try it out. \nThe layout of the restaurant left some to be desired, as the host stand is at the back, and the place is very small save for the upstairs, but they were able to sit us almost immediately in the upstairs dining room which was small, yet charming, and slightly more roomy. A gentleman who I am guessing was the co-owner was very friendly and ensured our 8:00 reservation was filled and the wine poured. The service wasn't slow, though awkward. It seemed that our server was there when we didn't need her, yet not there when we did, though she had a very friendly demeanor and was not rushing us in the least.\nThe food was delicious, though a few things stood out to me as peculiar, hence the 4 stars instead of 5. This was a legit Italian restaurant, yet they had ravioli as an antipasto. Anybody who knows Italian knows this means \"before\" the pasta, not the pasta itself. Secondly, the bread, which was very good, came with butter, and not Olive Oil. Again, this was an Italian restaurant, not an Applebee's. \nFor our appetizer we ordered eggplant, which was okay. Was sliced a bit too thin, though this may have been personal preference, but in doing so was masked by the (delicious) red gravy and (addictive) mozzarella, which was very fresh, so while I may not have been tasting the eggplant, I was tasting some very delicious flavors. \nOur main courses came in due time afterwards, enough to let our eggplant digest, but not enough time to make us forget. I ordered the special, linguine in a light vodka cream sauce with salmon and capers, my date ordered the canneloni. Both were inspired. Not the gigantic portions known to most frequent Italian restaurant goers in Philadelphia, but just enough. The flavors were subtle, yet plentiful. \nWe did skip dessert in favor of coffee. I ordered a double espresso, my date a cappucino (I know, but she was cute, so it's okay). The waittress came out with a regular and double cappucino. Wasn't the end of the world, so I just enjoyed it, and it was good, but just speak up if you want an espresso. \nOverall I recommend this place, mainly for the main courses, but am willing to go back and give it another shot and give Porcini's their 5th star. I hope I can!",

We decided to stop in here for late night drinks/dessert after visiting Shady Jack's and the Third Degree Glass Factory's third Friday night special event.  \n\nIt was a little tricky to find and I may or may not have ran a stop sign or two as I looked for it.  oopsies! :)  We finally made it inside after my scary driving.  The place is so stinkin' cute.  I love the decorations, the old decor, and the little booths with the radio thing.  \n\nThe menu is slightly overwhelming if you're looking for a delicious alcoholic icecream martini because everything looks so gosh darn good!  After debating for what felt like an hour I finally settled on the Thin Mint martini and boy was it good - a tad strong but YUMTASTIC in my mouth!  \n\nStewart got the Chocolate Covered Almond which also tasted fabulous and the Orange Dreamsicle which I didn't care for.  Then again I don't like orange dreamsicles and this tasted just like one. haha.\n\nKate got The Great Mississippi Mudslide which was amazing as well and the Love Potion #9.  The love potion one tasted interesting - kinda like a liquid PB&J in your mouth which is an odd sensation but exactly what they were going for.\n\nI'd definitely come back and visit again with friends since it was a cute little place and I'd love to try the others I was debating on.   \n\nFunny thing though - I was totally the only one carded! of course I do look like I'm 15 so what can ya expect?! I thought it was funny.\n\nside note: the bathrooms are small and cramped with weird doors.  not a fan.",

It is very hot but smells of wonderful aromas. This place is cash only. So now onto the food. Cuban for $9 I was like yes please. The guy said to me hey the footling is about 1lb of meat and to me I was thinking sounds great. I got this. I was wrong by a mile. When I opened this thing it is a monster. I powered through half and immediately you are hit with smoked pork which is melting in my mouth, nice thin ham, Swiss and a crunchy buttery bread. The sauce was creamy which is the only thing I wished was alittle more mustard zesty instead but overall the Cuban was amazing. I feel as if there was well over a pound of meat on it and you better make time out of your day to eat this and then take a food coma nap. The person before me had a salad which didn't even fit in the togo box. They are very generous on their portion sizes and the prices are cheap for what you get.

In some ways, Ghini's reminds me of the Hotel Congress' Cup Cafe, but quieter and more laid-back. I've been here for breakfast, lunch, and desserts. Ghini's is a popular place with a solid reputation---and the bakery next door is a favorite too. I'm awarding the cafe four stars instead of five because the place does get a little chaotic during the peak times (again, just like the Cup) and I can see how a first-time visitor might find that off-putting. All in all, I recommend you try Ghini's and discover one of Tucson's delights. Enjoy!",

I'm used to doing brunch in places where eggs and cheese and breakfast meats and sweet treats like french toast over flow on your plate. \n\nIt's not that the servings at Ants Pants are skimpy, far from it, but I don't leave there feeling like I overdid it or won't eat again for days. I also love that some of the menu items are slightly unusual or interesting. My favorite is the bacon stack; (which gets a thumbs up just in name alone), a delicious piece of thick toasted bread topped with a fried egg, bacon. arugula and shaved pecorino. This tastes like something my Mom used to make for us when we were little, it was late Spring and the garden had started to produce the yummiest greens I've ever eaten.   \n\nThe other nice thing about Ants Pants is that it is easy walking distance from center city, but far enough west that you will be able to find parking on Sunday morning. Be prepared to wait though, Ant's Pants is far from its days as a hidden gem.",

Its sister store in Fishers has more room, assuredly, but the vibe downtown can't be beat!\n\nAs far as beer selection, you don't get an enormous selection, but you get a varied one: many local selections sit side by side with British stand-bys like Old Speckled Hen and London Pride. Bartenders and servers are top-notch in service.\n\nI haven't taken in their food too much, to be honest, but I'd totally recommend the sandwiches. Friends of mine recommend their brunches for the early morning excursions.\n\nIt is a very packed place, especially when huge derby matches are going on...and in World Cup season, get there EARLY.

The texture of the acai was very different. It had a glue-like texture rather than the classic icy-smoothie style. Besides the texture throwing me off, this was great! The sliced fruit was fresh and the acai wasn't so cold that it gives me a brain freeze! What really surprised me was how big the portion was. If you're not that hungry, I would recommend splitting this with someone or getting the kiddie bowl. \n\nThe acai bowls are a little more on the pricier side~ $9 but it is a filling meal. \n\nThere's free parking for the first 75 minutes in the lot across the way.",

    "text": "Little did I know there's an alternate route heading deeper into Santa Barbara County with the 154, and perhaps the one of the things that make the little detour worth the drive is making a stop into this quaint little spot. \n\nThe tavern used to be an old stagecoach stop back in the days people used actual horsepower to power their transport, and the original structures seem to have been kept intact from those days. The clientele mostly consists of people who like to take their transport of choice and drive it around with people who have similar transports of choice as they (READ: bikers and people with cool, classic cars). The place itself is split into two structures: the tavern and the restaurant. \n\nWe were there for lunch, so we got to sit in the room with the big window and HUGE fireplace. The menu is fairly small but offers a nice selection, and I went for their standard, famous chili (I dare not try their \"fancy\" chili with black beans and wild game including rabbit...I don't eat the bunnies :C ), and I decided to have it atop a plate of fries. Very very yummy. I had a lavender martini to go with it, which was made with  fresh lavender picked from the outside! That was okay. The winner, however, was The Smuggler, a spirited dessert coffee drink made with creme de menthe (or peppermint schnapps?). Now I'm a HUGE mint fiend, and I already expected it wouldn't be minty enough for me, but surprisingly perfectly minty! \n\nThe prices of everything isn't a great deal, but it's still pretty fair.\n\nI took a peek into the actual tavern, which was pretty cool looking. I'd gladly have a drink in there, or outside the place, as you can do and would want to do on a nice day as it was when I went, but by no means am I going to have a hankerin' to drive allll the way over there just to have a few cold ones. All the same, if ever I'm the area again, I wouldn't hesitate upon the suggestion to go here (READ: I'd more likely go here before I go to Pink's again).",

Now that we have Megu, we no longer have to worry when the mood for onion soup, filet mignon dipped in ginger dressing, or vanilla ice cream tempura, strikes,  this is our GO TO place. Usually the wait isn't horrific, but it depends when you go and how many tables are already in use. Our kids love watching the show, and well, we just love to eat! The filet mignon is always so tender, you can cut it with your fork if need be. The fried rice is amazing, and the dressing on their salad is so good, we sometimes just stop by for a quart of that, and some of their ginger sauce! Yes, it's THAT GOOD.  I have yet to try the sushi here, but am sure if it's anything like the hibachi side, you won't be disappointed in that department,either! Give it a try-but before you go, don't forget to check your 'money mailer' ...they normally put cupons in there for $10 off, etc. Enjoy!",

The food/drinks are always stellar and while the staff is super friendly, the only issue with The Bricks is the time it takes to order/be served.  \n\nIt isn't like the servers are slow either, they are clearly working their assess off running from table to table, so maybe it is that people have called in sick the couple of times I've been in recently and they had to work twice as hard but a Sunday lunch shouldn't take 3 hours.  \n\nNow that my complaining is out of the way, the restaurant itself is super groovy.  The kitchen is on full display so no crazy stories of chefs putting anything crazy into your food here.  And they look like they are having a great time while they prepare meals (whether they are or not, I love to see people enjoy what they do).  I normally get draft beer but their cocktails look really interesting and innovative.  \n\nAt lunch, I normally get the \"Goodness\" which is a hummus wrap and it comes with a choice of a side ($8).  Don't bother being wishy-washy on the side, get the Asian slaw, it is delicious, and if available I would order as a meal.  The wrap was good but the star was the slaw.  Thai, pea-nutty, goodness:)\n\nI've gotten the Elvis before ($8) and it was delicious but something I can make a home.  I ordered it without bacon.  \n\nMy husband ordered the burrito and loved it as well ($9).  Others at our table raved about the Chicken and the Pig, The BBQ pork, and The Cure sandwiches.  Everyone really liked their food.  \n\nThe Bricks really is a great spot on the 7th Avenue strip, perfect for late night people watching that make Ybor awesome and also out of the way enough to not feel like it's distinctly part of the Ybor scene.",

The Salsa Trio is a tasty starter, and the Fire and Ice cocktail is one of my favorite drinks. \n\nAs much as I love the food here, my review is only a four star due to the seating policy. I can understand restaurant not taking reservations, but the restaurant also has a policy that they will only seat when all parties have arrived. The parking is extremely limited - so limited the restaurant had to apply for a variance for parking. This means if you have to park on the street and want to drop off an elderly person or your spouse and young children, they will not be seated until you have parked and walked to the restaurant. Once in the pouring rain my husband dropped me at the door with our infant son, and the restaurant staff refused to seat me because my husband wasn't there yet, despite my explanation that he was trying to find a parking spot on the street since their lot was full. There were several open tables and instead of letting me get settled with a few month old baby, they insisted that I wait at the drafty entrance. I left and went elsewhere. I laughed out loud when we showed up for Mother's Day brunch a couple months later and was asked if I had a reservation. Although it states extremely clearly on their website that reservations are not accepted, they apparently make exceptions for Mother's Day brunch. I was pleasantly surprised that we were seated quickly once I explained the experience at our previous visit.",

    "text": "Food is great, drinks are great, deals are great (Brunch with 2-4-1 drinks? Heck yeah!). The menu is extensive and interesting, with unique twists on classic dishes. The service is also great, but I am withholding a fifth star due to the management's seating policies.\n\nWe came for brunch on a Sunday expecting an hour plus wait, so when the hostess informed us it would be 1hr45m we weren't surprised. However, we became frustrated when we noticed there were 4 open tables on the patio that still hadn't been seated after an hour of waiting. It was a beautiful day so we asked the hostess about it and she said that the tables were reserved. When we asked again, she explained that the patio tables were not assigned to a specific server but were instead added on to a server's load inside, so they weren't seating them because they didn't want to overwhelm the servers. Totally understandable to not want to overwork your servers, but why not seat people with the caveat that service will be slower? Or better yet, why not specifically assign a server to the outdoor section so that wait times will be lower? Having worked in the service industry, our group was confused by this. We ended up just sitting at one of the empty patio tables until the hostess notified us that a table was ready. \n\nWe ordered the Cheddar Biscuit, the Wood Fire Double Yokes, and a Turkey Feta Omelette from the specials board and all were delicious. The biscuit comes in a trio and though it doesn't look like a lot of food they are VERY filling. Our server surprised us with a side of White Trash Hash on the house because our food was taking longer than expected (we didn't even notice the timing, so it was a very nice gesture). The White Trash Hash is a must, this stuff is addicting! Potatoes, rice, and gooey cheese- who could ask for more.\n\nOverall, great place for brunch in Nashville. Expect a long line but food worth the wait. Hopefully management can improve their seating policies to cut down on wait times in the future.",

They have a regular sliders (cheeseburger, fried chicken) on the board and daily ones (pork belly, fried oyster, blackened chicken Caesar) on a menu.  We decided on the fried chicken sliders, fried oyster, and the pork belly sliders. \n\nFried chicken was delicious.  Perfectly fried, not too heavy.  Their was a nice kick on the chicken along with some jalape\u00f1o and a nice slaw to go with it.  Fried oyster was good, too. Nicely battered (cornmeal crusted?) and fried.  Not at all greasy.  You can still taste the oyster. The pork belly was decent.  Just as you'd expect from fatty pork belly with pickled onions.  As you can see, I went from the favourite to least favourite (even though the least favourite is still pretty good).  The sliders are pretty small, so expect yourself to order multiple.  No shame.  And at around 3.50-5$, why not?\n\nThe inside of this place is open and airy.  There's even outdoor seating in the back.

The service has always been good (and sometimes really fun when we've had Jessica wait on us) and the food consistent and delicious.  I don't expect fancy or special event food when I go, you can go to several nice places on The Hill for that, but I always enjoy my meal here and that it is a good value.  Promotions like 2.99 cheese garlic bread are offered and I've never been turned down for special requests like extra meat sauce in a to-go box.  I'd recommend the chicken flamingo.  I've had one incident where the food had an issue, and the server quickly and in a friendly way made it right.  The manager also made the effort to come over to follow up and talk with us.  Overall, can't go wrong with good service, enjoyable food that they stand behind and good value.",

    "text": "I'm torn between 3 and 4 stars, but have decided to go with the more generous offering?  Why?  Because this place has one of the most generous menus as far as choices go.  There is a ton to choose from, even if you're vegetarian.  \nFormalities first--why can't there be some ambiance at Indian restaurants.  I know I'm painting with broad strokes here, but it seems like outside of NYC, no Indian restaurant in the US can get creative with their dining space.  Not sure why that is, but whatever.\nAn early arrival on a Sunday found the place quiet, with maybe 10 or so people dining.  No problem getting a table for 2.  We started the evening off with some garlic Naan.  Delicious, although I think next time I'll stick with regular, at almost half the cost.  We also got some Finger Paneer, little spiced fried cubes of cheese.  These were denser than typical Paneer.  The cheese was slightly bland, but the spices were good.  Overall, an enjoyable start to the meal.  I also had a lemonade, which may have been made fresh.  Regardless, it was tasty. \nEntrees included Paneer Bhurji and Lamb Shahi Korma.  We elected \"spicy\" as our seasoning level.  I'll admit, I have a pretty strong ability to deal with spiciness.  But this was some ultra-spicy food when it arrived!  We quickly ordered a mango lassi to help put out the fire.  Still, even through the spices, there were decent flavors coming through.  The nutiness of the Korma was especially nice, as was the blended creaminess.\nI'm intrigued enough to return for more offerings.  I am humbled however by their spiciness--something that has not happened to me in many many years.  Next time, I am going to stick with \"medium\" spiciness!",

It's a decent bar with a decent size list of beer selections.  There were over 50 beers listed, so you are likely to find something you'd like.  \n\nI'm more impressed that the bartender was able to make a good bitter lemon and gin.  So that's +1 from a 3 stars for me considering that a lotttt of bartenders do not know how to make it.  \n\nBesides the drinks, I've had the Chicken & Portabello Panini and Fish & Chips so none of the Irish dishes. The food is average that's just a tad bit pricey, although the proportion is slightly big.  \n\nService is great though. The waitresses kept checking back a lot to see if we needed more drinks and to reconfirm we've received everything we requested.  I highly appreciated that.",

Now to the soup,I ordered chicken with noodles and vegetables my son ordered a spicy beef and vegetables soup. Mine came in the largest bowl I have ever seen the noodles tasted freshly made the dish was excellent. We both enjoyed our meals and wouldn't hesitate to come back.

There is also a pork chop entree that is really good, but not as tender as the pork and fig.\n\nThe bbq shrimp was really good....they give you a bib so you don't splatter on yourself.  \n\nThey had a fish special of the night which was a drum....never heard of that kind of fish, but it was also really good.\n\nOverall,  good place.

I finally saw where whisk was located and there was plenty of parking so I decided to go in (yes whisk is not too far from mud house but only had 8 mins to spare).

I'm so happy I stopped into whisk because OMG their lavender scones are absolutely delicious!!!! I came here on a Wednesday afternoon....the case was not full of goodies but just enough to pick a few.\n\nWhat I tried....\n\nStrawberry Whoopie Pie: I got this for my nephew. It was good! Something with the cream, it's light and fluffy! And not too sweet at all!\n\nSalted Caramel Cupcake: recommend by staff. It was really good but way too super sweet. One bite and I was done, the icing is just way too rich for my tasting. \n\nBacon Chocolate Chip Cookie: another recommendation by staff. I tasted bacon once throughout the entire cookie. For some reason I don't think bacon in a cookie goes together. Something I didn't care for. \n\nLavender Scone: it was calling my name but I had to ask...if they were moist and not super dry. The girl was right! She told me it was buttery and not dry at all. I hate dry scones. But OMG!!! Out of the world yummy! If I didn't have the lavender scone I'm sure my rating would of been a 3 star. LOL!! But I was craving something lavender.\n\nI will be back to try other goodies! Especially the Popsicles and scones! \n\nIf you like lavender and scones. You must have one from here!",

I've had my share of gourmet donuts and I can truly say that the Brown Butter Pistachio, Chocolate Glazed and the Cookies and Cream Donut are some of the best donuts had. The brown butter pistachio has a nice nutty flavor with slightly salty salty pistachios, the chocolate glazed is chocolatey yet not overwhelmingly sweet, in fact it's actually quite sinfully dark, and the cookies and cream is sweet and crunchy and delicious. Other than the donuts, I've tried their fries and the fries are delicious. The cheesy fries are good but the cheese has a slightly gritty feel to it. That's about the only thing keeping me from giving that a 5 star review. Over all it's a perfect place to grab lunch or dinner and a big ol' donut for dessert.

We sat at the bar and the bartender was friendly and helpful. \nIt was around 6 pm, so we reached for the happy hour menu (4-7 pm M-F).  Both my friend and I got the Tavern Jalape\u00f1o Margarita. I think this is my new favorite drink! Slightly spicy with charred lemon and unique deep flavor. Most importantly- not sweet! Perfection!\nWe shared the sandwich shooters. They are the only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars. I had higher expectations. The tomato bisque was kinda bland, and the baguettes were not anything to write home about. For my main entree i had the Southwest bowl- delicious! Great flavors, generous portion and nice presentation. My friend got the district salad with salmon and she was very happy with her choice too. I'd definitely come back again for the jalape\u00f1o margarita and to try something else on the menu. \nTip-you can take the Downtowner to and from here!",

Got there at 4:45 yesterday and the bartender though friendly to us...sort of ...was rude to others around us. Made us uncomfortable. Then the 2 who took her place ( personality wise ) was not much better. One tall younger girl was good...never let our glasses get empty...but no personality..the older lady of the 2 did not say one word to us. In fact seemed down right miserable..even when giving us our bill totalling well over 100 for dinner and drinks, did not say a word to us..not thanks..nothing...saw her laugh and talk with a few locals but others...nothing...owner is sitting on a gold mine. I sure the hell would have a little more customer friendly people working the bar...The band rocked....worth the trip...just dont expect a smile or a thanks if you're at the outside tiki bar and you have one of the 3 girls working.....got the seafood bucket...was market price and great.

Thankfully, Yelp finds even the most hidden gems. \n\nI ordered the Spicy Basil Fried Rice (peppers, onion, string beans, chili & egg) with chicken, which is enough for 2 people. The dish is medium spicy, but plenty hot for the average palate. Chicken was plentiful in the take out dish.  \n\nI will definitely return for the Lobster or Pad Thai, or one of the many Thai drinks on the menu.",

Wanting to avoid chain restaurants, yelp steered us towards this little local gem!\n\nThe ladies had the 7 oz. Tampa strip and the gents both had a 14 oz. ribeye. They grill their steaks over oak and citrus Wood and the smoky flavor is to die for! We are big fans of our smoker back home and cook our steaks this way as well, it's rare to find steak cooked over woodsmoke in most places and this was worth the side trip!  Sides were veggies and sweet potatoes. The wines on offer were so reasonably priced- most under $20 a bottle but a decent selection. They just don't mark them up 5x like most places! \n\nOur waitress Lisa also made great recommendations and her service was welcoming, friendly, and excellent. We are so glad we went local instead of to a chain. Bookmarking this place for a return trip next time I am in Tampa for sure!",

The girls and I walked right in on a Friday night with a few bottles of wine in hand and had a wonderful experience at Zorbas. We shared an array of dishes such as the cold platter stocked with great mix of yummy greek dips ( hummus, feta , tzatzikii etc). It was a hit for sure- just note that it comes with one pita- the dips are very generous and the 5 of us had no problem sharing- we had to request more pita though (which by the way, the pita is perfect). The mussels in a sweet red red wine sauce sans shells were so tasty. The hot feta dip and spring salad were also just as good. We topped the meal off splitting a delicious slice of cake in honor of my friend's birthday. The service was very accomodating and the atmosphere inside is super cozy- nothing fancy,  has an old school Greek feel. All of this for a mere $15/person.  You can't beat it !

The selection was just right.\n\nWe found street parking as the lot was full, and at 7pm waited a bit for a table as they don't accept reservations for parties of less than 6.\n\nTo start, we ordered the Escargot, and it came from the kitchen screaming hot. So hot, the cheese had broken. I was looking forward to the crunchy brown bits to munch on but only had a couple of small bits that survived.  As a celiac, I couldn't dunk for the garlic butter, and they didn't bring any bits for my dining companion to dunk after I had finished.  Our server was MORE than helpful, we could have asked, but wondered if this was how it was usually served.\n\nNext I ordered the daily special - squid, mussels and shrimp with a garlic butter sauce and gluten free penne corn pasta.  I'm not usually a fan of a single ingredient gluten free pasta - corn tends to be a bit dry and fussy.  Tonight was not much of an exception.  \n\nTasty? Oh my YES. But again, without (gluten free) bread or bun to soak up that beautiful garlic butter sauce - a bit sad.  The seafood was cooked to perfection, and I don't get to say that very often.  The penne... well, stab it with a fork and some broke in half. A large spoon would have been a great addition to the dish for scooping.  I think I managed OK, because I ate almost all of it and forgot to take pictures!\n\nMy dining companions all finished their meals and had desserts which looked fantastic - tiramisu was beautiful and large! Some would share it, but for others, it's just right. \n\nBe prepared to leave by 9:30pm on a Thursday, as the cleaners apparently come soon after! (I've never heard that before, but...Ok.)\n\nNot every establishment can handle gluten free ingredients or diners, but they did well.  They weren't certain if the gelato was safe, and probably cross-contamination from others might be an issue, so good call by our waitress.  I'm looking forward to the single serving packages of buns from certain gluten free bakers (wink wink) that might make it easier for restaurants to thaw only one at a time (yes, you have to keep them frozen until serving - they get dried out, inedible and gross pre-thawed).\n\nI believe we will return to try more items on their menu.",

    "text": "The Red Owl Tavern is conveniently connected to the hotel and also open to the general public, thus providing a stylishly casual setting to enjoy a meal or cocktail. On a recent weekend trip to Philly, we stayed at the Hotel Monaco, parked our car, and enjoyed the area. Because our weekend was packed with family events, Red Owl offered a place for us to stop in for a quick bite or drink, without the stuffy hotel bar/restaurant feel.  \n\nIn a three day period, we somehow managed to experience happy hour, drinks, and brunch. The charcuterie platter was substantial and thoughtfully crafted, the perfect pair to a locally brewed pint. Also recommended: the donuts.\n\nBrunch menu items range from healthy to traditional; the potatoes are delicious. Note that the bloody marys are chock full of horseradish--I enjoy a spicy bloody, but we had to order extra tomato juice to balance the flavor.\n\nAll in all, Red Owl took the guesswork out of navigating the neighborhood between events, offering variety and friendly service to keep us coming back.",

    "text": "Dear Brewpub,\n\nYou are my go-to place for vegetarian comfort food in Indianapolis. But somebody has to tell you: your beer is bad. This news best come from someone who loves you, from an old friend. So here I am, trying to break the news gently after being tempted by the siren song of \"$3 pints\" last night. \n\nBut let's be frank now. You need to do something about your beer because you are a \"brewpub,\" supposedly, but your house-made beer sucks. It's flat. It has no body. For those folks out there who have thought that maybe Brewpub's beer tasted bad because your unsophisticated palette was unable to appreciate the complexity of this craft beer, that is not the case! It's just not good beer. Now that we have Sun King and Upland and People's brewing tasty beer in the central region of the Hoosier state, Brewpub, your mediocre suds are unacceptable. \n\nI love your spinach melt, your garden sloppy joe, your salad dressings, the sauce on your ravioli. You have an enjoyable atmosphere and nice outdoor seating right off the Monon. So, please just fix this one thing. \n\nWith love from your fan,\nEmily",

It was around 6 or 7 on a Saturday afternoon and there was not many cupcakes left choose from. I think they had wedding cake cupcake, lemon, blueberry, raspberry and birthday cake cupcake but only about four of each. I saw the lemon filled lemon cupcake and went for that. My girlfriend got the blueberry cream cheese cupcake. When we got out to the car I took one bite of this cupcake and my taste buds exploded, it was so good. I hadn't had dinner yet so I vowed to eat the rest after dinner. I couldn't stop eating this cupcake. It was gone before we even got over to Chick-Fil-A for dinner. My girlfriend was driving so she couldn't shove her face quite as quick as I could, but she had half of hers gone by the time we got over to Chick-Fil-A. She was a good girl and saved the other half of hers for after dinner. If I'm ever in the area again I'll trying stopping by earlier in the day. The man working the counter said they had a bigger selection in the morning.",

I think with a larger group it would just get better!  \n\nAfter finding the restaurant in a back alley and knocking on the door to get in, we were seated promptly in the front room.  Reservations would be a good idea on weekend nights especially.  \n\nThe food was yummy - not earth shattering perhaps, but definitely a good range and interesting for a fixed course meal.  We chose the spicy chicken and the beef kabobs, and they were probably the best two courses (well besides baklava and mint tea being so awesomely delicious).  We also called ahead and found out that although they now have a full bar, you can still bring in a bottle of wine.  Definitely a good deal - heads up that some of the servers seem rather confused about the policy.\n\nAfter almost 3 hrs (!) I was full and well entertained - I highly recommend the experience.",

It is really convenient that you can sit at the counter and get waited on there.\n\nService:  The staff was upbeat and pleasant.  They were the ones who recommended we sit at the counter, which was a really nice experience.  We didn't feel rushed to get out of our seats.  It was really great that they offer you a sample of the food if you are unsure.\n\nFood:  Overall very good.  I was hoping for a bit more spice and strong flavors, but it seems like it is made marketable for the general population.  Which worked out fine with me because there were seasonings available on the counter to bump up the flavor profile.  I got the etouffee and bread pudding.  The etouffee was good, but the flavor got a little muddled after eating it for a while.  It didn't have the depth of flavor that I was hoping for.  The bread pudding was super delicious!  I would recommend it to anyone needing a sweet fix.  My friend enjoyed her jambalaya.\n\nOverall:  I would certainly come back.  The convenient location, good service, and yummy food are all definite pluses.  I am not sure that it is the best New Orleans place in Philly, but I am happy to partake of the menu again sometime soon.",

My bowl of mussels and clams was HUGE and I sopped up the buttery, faintly spiced broth with the accompanying breadstick. Well done. The other appetizers like Tuna Tartare and Coconut Shrimp each had awesome flavor surprises - fresh, melty tuna and a wasabi and jam sauce respectively - both excellent and plated beautifully.\n\nMy cocktail \"The Tryst\" didn't impress. Watery and a strange alcohol after taste. I'll forget it tomorrow. \n\nSERVICE\nThanks Yelp for introducing me here. It's easy to get overlooked at the bar, but once seated, our server was quick and helpful and was great at lowering my inhibitions by telling me what to expect in a \"vegetable\" beer they offered--spot on. \n\nSUMMARY\nI'll probably stick to the drinks only here because the food prices are above my range... or go during happy hours. Cool, hip place to bring the girlfriends or if you're looking for impressive, gutsy art dishes with good taste.... and if you have cash to blow (but I won't let that subtract a review star)",

Perhaps too hip for many over 35 but if you can tolerate the boisterous and extremely casually attired youth--I haven't worn a suit in 20 years either but even 20 year olds should have something besides skinny jeans and T-shirts with borderline obscene slogans in their closets--the food is worth it and the staff copes well.   \n\nI had a 6:00 reservation (obtained the day before) but the sky seemed threatening a downpour so I came early to avoid it and was seated 20 minutes or so before the appointed time.  I often don't even make reservations and have no trouble getting seated at popular places by being there when they open or, for those open all day, coming before the popular dinner hour, but that didn't work the day before at L\u00fcke.  Even at 4:30 the place was packed so I did make one for the following day.\n\nMy meal started with the crispy Brussel Sprouts.  Even if you hate Brussels sprouts (I like them), don't be afraid to try this dish--if no one told you you might not know what you were eating.  They are in some sort of sweet/sour sauce/dressing and fried both slightly blackened and crispy as advertised . . . tossed with almond slices, small bits of jalape\u00f1o and sprinkled with shavings of cheese on top.\n\nThen I had pork schnitzel and \"pommes frites\" (that's shoestring fries to the Galliphobes).  It came with whitish gravy in a pitcher, I suppose to make it \"Southern\".  The gravy was good but I skipped eating it, doing that the usual way with a squeeze of lemon.  It was excellent and the fries were fine too.\n\nI finished with some excellent decaf and a glass of Kahlua--I had had iced tea with the meal so some alcohol was not an excess.\n\nA lady who was some sort of hostess dropped by my table while I was eating to make sure everything was OK and when told I needed ketchup (for the fries), went and got me some (in a dainty little single-serve Heinz bottle).  My waiter also checked several times but didn't hover.\n\nI am giving it 4 stars.  The 5th star is withheld because of the crowded dining room and noise level . . . nothing to do with the food which I greatly enjoyed.",

    "text": "I love Latin food, but I don't want to go to deep DEEP north Philly and I'm not always up to spending what they spend at the Center City spots. So Parada Maimon is a good compromise. Most of the times I've been here I've gotten the pernil with rice and black beans. I've tried the half chicken, the gizzards, and the mofongo. The chicken was good enough that I brought some home to my family. It was a hit. The price can't really be beaten. For those wondering, you can sub out rice and beans for some fries... or maybe some other side they're offering. \n\nWhat issues did I have? You can either order at the counter or you can have a seat. The counter (cafeteria style) food is ready-made while most other things are made to order. My first impression was underwhelming... as the pernil I had was dry. I didn't know to ask for gravy since I ordered from the menu. That wasn't enough to keep me away because I came back and had the mofongo and I didn't like it much. I mentioned in a review for another place that I don't fault the establishment. I just didn't know what I was getting into because it more or less tastes the same everywhere I've tried it. There was a little confusion in the portions... they should just say large and small, but instead they say lunch and dinner if I remember correctly.\n\nSo for the best dine-in experience... order at the counter, if you're not fluent in Spanish then English is fine...mostly (I got a verbal judo flip with my basic Spanish), state what sauces/gravy you want on your food and then have a seat. Also, get one of their fresh juices (Chinola for me). If you really want to EAT get the dinner (large) portion, but if you're there for the deal get the lunch (small). \n\nSo with a large plate of pernil with a good amount of gravy, some hot sauce and oil for the rice, and some thousand island or whatever for the little salad... I'm NICE! I think they have tres leches too, but I've been too full to try it.\n\nPRO-TIP: And ask for maduros... I don't think they're included, but I don't think they're extra. It's just like 3 or 4 and anyway.\n\nFUN FACT: The area is desolate so there's really no best way in or out on foot. You're catching alleys, bums, and long empty stretches on all sides. Seriously, don't let that stop you from checking this place out.",

So I was able to get an omelet, a side of grits, and I upgraded to banana bread French toast. Overall, the food was good but it wasn't amazing. The French toast and grits were my favorite thing about the meal....for some reason the omelet just didn't do it for me.

The food was pretty dang good and drinks are too. The only reason I left off a star was the fact it took a little while to get our cocktails and our appetizer came at the same time as our food. But, they're new and I've been in hospitality before, so I get it!",

    "text": "They have a few locations, and we picked the one that is in more of a residential area than a busy center of the city. There was no line when we arrived shortly after 11am. But, it was still busy, it can get crowded very quickly with a very small interior. They have five counter seats, and that is about it. While we were there, most of them were there to purchase the food to go, so the seats were not in high demand.\n\nEven though this is mainly a donut shop, they also offer enticing fried chicken. We ordered their very popular Fried Chicken Sandwich, available from 11am. It was smaller than I thought it would be, but I always take quality over quantity. It was juicy, tasty, with a nice little kick to it. We really enjoyed it!\n\nWe couldn't just order chicken from a donuts shop, so we got a couple of donuts from their Hot Donuts selections. We chose Cookies & Cream and Strawberry Lavender. We both liked the strawberry one better, since it had better, stronger flavor. Cookies & Cream was good but didn't have much flavor. \n\nDefinitely a place to visit if you are visiting Philly!",

It was a beautiful afternoon, and a handful of people were scattered around the shop and the outdoor seating area, working on laptops and visiting with friends. \n\nI ordered a small cold brew with vanilla, easy on the ice. I added a hunk of gluten free zucchini bread (the bread butt; the best part!) to my order and paid with a credit card. They have a fancy touchscreen register that lets you add tip to your card purchase. \n\nI topped off my drink with whole milk -- which in itself was a real treat. It's so rare to see whole milk at the mixing station! \n\nBefore leaving, I asked what else they had in the way of a GF offering, and the young man behind the counter said \"just the zucchini bread.\" That's a real bummer; the zucchini bread is great but I'd love to have more than one option. \n\nMy drink was smooth and had a perfect flavor. I was happy with my choices. \n\nIf I lived in the neighborhood, I'd be here all the time. I like the hipstery feeling of this place, and everything I've ordered has been delightful.",

I have had lots of different items from the menu.  \n\nThe small brisket plate is a great option--brisket plus 2 sides--I like the cowboy beans (spicy baked beans) and slaw.  Also, the chicken quesadilla isn't what you would normally expect.  Chicken is SO spicy, and it's pulled right off the bone.  It's fantastic.  The brisket tacos are amazing, and my all-time favorite is the shrimp diablo--a shrimp stuffed into a jalapeno with cream cheese, and wrapped with bacon.  Your mouth will be on FIRE but it's totally worth it!  \n\nI take away a star because the only location for Judge Bean's is now in Greer Stadium, where the Sounds play.  If you go to a game, be sure to go up to the restaurant on the 4th floor!  The 12th Avenue location is, sadly, closed.",

The scrapple is great, so are the breakfast potatoes.\n\nToday  I had the grilled pastrami on rye with Swiss and 1,000 dressing. The only thing missing is some sauerkraut.

    "text": "The only reason I didn't give this restaurant a 5 star rating, is because of one single pretentious waiter. As a 4 night guest at Hotel Palomar, the location of the restaurant is an obvious plus. The first night of my stay, I met a coworker in the restaurant for a cocktail. When we arrived, the host staff were busy and not available, so we just walked in. The restaurant was not too busy, so we just looked at a small table next to the bar and proceeded to take a seat. A waiter came by and I quickly asked if we could have a seat, before sitting down and told him we'd only be having cocktails. He stumbled on his reply, and in an irritated/in-convinced tone, told me \"I guess it would be fine\" and basically just kept walking mid sentence. My guest and I brushed it off, and started having a conversation while looking at the drink menu. To make a long story short, he was distant and we both got the \"couldn't be bothered\" vibe from him. When it came to the bill, we asked if it could be split due to company transaction policies, and you would have thought asked him for some inconceivable task. We basically spent the rest of our night and elevator ride to our room in shock of the rudeness we had just experienced. \n\nAlthough that situation left a bad taste in our mouth, and the night before we decided to avoid the restaurant, we decided to grab another cocktail and give this place one more try. After looking around and ensuring \"last nights waiter\" wasn't on shift, we walked over to the bar and started looking over the menu. Instantly, the bartender greeted us with pleasant small talk and made us feel 100% welcome. He asked about our day, recommended cocktails and was a completely genuine person. This guy (I think his name was Ben) is an absolute star! He gave us lessons on Whiskey, described how to make classic cocktails, and was 100% invested in our experience. This is exactly what a bartender at a 4/5 star establishment should be - actually he exceeds that. He was kind, funny, friendly and completely redeemed this restaurant/bar from our terrible experience the night before. \nI also ordered room service last night from this restaurant, and it was amazing. The bacon wrapped dates and chocolate cake are to die for! Great restaurant and amazing bartender(s). Too bad one bad egg could have spoiled this experience.",

You are greeted like an old friend when you enter.  The food tastes good, which is why we keep going back.  We have lots of choices and the atmosphere and food are winners.  Our 7 year old grandson went with us last weekend and the waitress really embellished his hot chocolate - his eyes almost popped out of his head.  He ate almost all of his very generous two eggs (more like three), his bacon and two HUGE pancakes.  \n\nThe biscuits and gravy are what we normally get - it is very tasty. \n\nMy only complaint would be the processed swiss cheese in the scrambles vs regular swiss but that is a small issue to me and I should not be eating any cheese anyway so I skip.  \n\nBISCUITS HAS FREE WIRELESS. YEA!!!\n\nYes, we are fans.",

I had a few special requests (fried rice made with brown rice, all my food cooked in very very little oil, extra veggies)...and the food is PERFECT.  I mean, it is EXACTLY what I ordered.  The overall flavor of the food is fairly mainline as far as Chinese goes, the delivery time was within five minutes of their estimate, and I got a good amount of food.  Combine that with their perfect execution of my special orders, and it's safe to say I'll be ordering from here again!",

We happened to be visiting during happy hour so all beers were $2 off.  The kids meals are a steal at $5.50.  The portions are gigantic for kids and include a veggie or fruit, and a drink. \n\nOur server, Catelyn was fantastic.  She made sure we had exactly what we needed throughout our meal.

Their pizza is just *that* good.\n\nI grew up in Maryland, and whenever our family got pizza, it was from Ledo's.  After driving by this location on Dale Mabry multiple times, and laughing at the coincidence of a pizza place using the same name as my favorite place in MD, I looked it up online and realized it IS the same place.  Woo hoo!  I've been here three times now, and the pizza is just like I remembered, and just as good as I hoped it would be.\n\nTo start with - the pizza is square, and the pieces are cut into little squares.  It's thin crust, which is my favorite kind of pizza, as I hate filling up on dough.  The red sauce is sweet, and very distinctive.  I've tried all different varieties of pizza here, but I always come back to the classic pepperoni pizza.  Each individual square piece of pizza gets it own thick cut slice of pepperoni on top.  Heaven!  Then, before you know it, you've eaten multiple squares, and you roll out the door, fat and happy.\n\nService was good, waitress was friendly, and stopped by frequently to make sure we had what we needed.  I do wish they supplied better quality paper napkins, as I went through about 1 per slice, but at least they are on the table to grab as many as you need.  Long and short of it - you know I'll be back!",

Crab bisque - flavored with old bay style seasoning but not overly salty and just a bit of shredded crab. The entree was a garganelli with roast pork ragu, mushrooms and creole tomatoes.  The sauce was light and blended the flavors well.  The roast pork highlighted the dish - fork tender, caramelized and left me wanting more.",

Going to try other things on the menu next time.",

We hadn't seen eachother since elementary school and got reacquainted through Facebook so this was a pretty special dinner. \n\nThe restaurant is very swanky and the prices show this. I do think the food was worth the price although all of my party thought it was very expensive. I ordered the lobster bake which was delicious. It was not fantastic and there wasn't alot of seafood but it was adequate for me. I also ordered a Neopolitan Old Fashion which was made perfectly. \n\nMy friends ordered the fritters, carpaccio, crab cake and fries. Plus 2 shots of tequila, a lemonade and 2 more old fashions. Bill was $170 which is not bad but some of my friends weren't expected it. \n\nAnd I must say something about our waiter. Unfortunately, I didn't remember his name but he was fantastic! Very attentive, nice and even bought out a dessert because it was also one of my friend's bday. He was just real cool. \n\n5 stars for service\n3 stars for food\n4 stars for ambience \n2 stars for price.  \n\nBut I was satisfied.",

I got pancakes and they are so fluffy and light and awesome (esp if you add a little butter).  The bacon was nice, thick, large slices; slightly overcooked maybe but super good cuz I love bacon! :)\nThe prices are reasonable and the service is great.

I personally didn't like their Pad Thai, BUT their Chinese food and Sushi rocks! \n\nI like their Shu Mai and Pot Stickers. Super filling for a meal on its own, but also great to share. They even have different dipping sauces to compliment the appetizers. The chicken fried rice was also nicely seasoned. \n\nI never met the Sushi chef, but I always do a pick-up order and the sushi is on point. Highly recommend the Rainbow Roll if you like raw fish, great portion size of tuna, yellowtail, and salmon with tobiko. I am definitely curious about their AYCE sushi and will come back here on date night. \n\nWhat tops it off is the people working here. All very accommodating, a bit aggressive, but they take pride of their restaurant. The restaurant is stunning,  with great decor, open light, and open concept.",

The room itself was ok, but it was the hotel grounds that made the stay.  \n\nThe hotel is obviously built to keep you within its property.  The inside is like a maze, but a beautiful one.  Huge gardens, an indoor river, boutiques, and endless restaurants and bars are all found within the hotel.  We joked that it was an 8 mile walk through jungle to get to the lobby.  \n\nThe Grand Ole Opry is a short walk from the hotel on a guided path.  Even if you are not a country music fan, go see this.  It really is a good show!  The hotel also provides shuttles to and from the downtown area.  The shuttle is overpriced at $20 per person, but it's cheaper than a taxi if you make multiple trips.  There is also a mall right within walking distance and still on site.",

There was a group of 10-15 of us and the restaurant was spaced out well to where we did not feel crowded. We started off with the chicken 65, veg pakora, and shrimp Manchurian. All came out with good timing, hot, and fresh. The chicken was quite juicy and had the right amount of heat, the shrimp were plump and buttery, and the veg pakora were crispy and did not have that super oily taste that they sometimes can have. We ordered the lamb tikka masala and the tandoori chicken for our entree and I will have to say the lamb melted in our mouth. There was no gamey taste yet it definitely still had a nice lamb flavor to it which was accompanied well by the gravy. The tandoori chicken was good but I would not say anything special- it was lacking in the umami department although it was a nice pieces of meat. We ordered everything medium and it had the perfect amount of heat ( I would say we like heat but not anything that is going to make us sweat). I probably wouldn't visit here again since I am coming in from out of town but if I lived near by I am sure it would be one of my indian food take out spots.",

Took our group of eight foodies there, including some chefs, after doing the nearby Jean LaFittes Swamp Tour, my friends wanting to spring for early supper, and it was outrageously good. I've included photos, the bill, and partial menu to help you, so I'll just hit the main points here. VICTORIA was our server, and with minimal assistance, she killed it like a stone-cold professional, waiting hand and foot on eight discriminating but fun foodies and cooks, has a memory like a steel trap, always a winning smile, and I'm impressed, big-time. Ask for her. This was a five-star review theirs to lose, and it was only with the presentation of my lemon wedge for my initial iced tea order, that all-important first impression one never can take back, that they lost the fifth star. NEVER bring decaying, slimy citrus to a group of peeps who are about to spend five or six hundred dollars in your restaurant. See photos. Now, from there on out, I'm telling you straight: This gorgeous restaurant, and its outstanding cuisine, which sits in a Louisiana swamp, would thrive just as well in Manhattan or Beverly Hills.  There are seriously talented chefs there, and they bring their A-Game. EVERY dish is perfect, with deep French roots that show through in the sauces and roux construction; fish, shrimp and all other seafood items sparkling fresh, harvested from the waters within sight of the dining areas. From the elegant indoor dining areas which overlook the bayou to the outdoor area with stone flooring and fireplace, this is a WINNER.",

I had the opportunity to try this restaurant last Saturday with a group of friends (25) for a birthday celebration.  \n\nThe owner was more than helpful in accommodating such a large party.  I can't review   the service in general since this was a unique situation but everyone working there went above and beyond and the service for our party was exceptional.\n\nThe atmosphere is bright, simple and pleasant.  \n\nThe stuffed plantain was amazing.  If you like plantains don't miss it.\n\nThe steak was a bit tough but the chicken was moist and flavorful. \n\nThe prices are very reasonable.\n\nThis place is new and still finding its stride, but the owners are very committed to their business and I have no doubt they will continue to refine the overall experience.",

All that changed last night when we were kept waiting over an hour for our food (the server explained they had a order come in for 45 pizza's) and people who had been seated 20 minutes after us were chewing away at their dinner. We also had to flag our waitress (older, petite, blondish hair) down to order more drinks after a 45 minute wait between beverages!!!! It was later on a Friday night, the dinner rush was over, but we still felt completely overlooked.  \nThe food is excellent, however my husband had the ribs (his usual) last night and he said they tasted phoned in. My lasagna was perfection and I'm glad I ordered it rather then my usual steak and potato. \nThe highlight is always the parkinglot. There is a Porsche GT3RS that always makes me smile and when I am able to park next to it in my Cayenne Turbo (yes, I know, I am not your typical woman...I love cars.) I imagine what it would be like to \"accidentally\" swap keys with whomever owns that car. \nWe will return, the food and normally, the service, is just too good to stay away. Besides, I might figure out who the owner of the car is....and convince him/her that a Porsche swap is due.",

Located off South Street, its entrance is a dark maroon door complete with an iron knocker. Please be sure to come with friends; as other reviews have stated Marakkesh's six course meal really packs a punch. \n\nThe food was mouthwateringly GOOD. I came here with one other person (rookie mistake) on a quiet Thursday evening, and the waiters were very attentive to us. Everything was delicious without being overly oily. For our first main course we ordered the Spicy Chicken in Cumin Sauce, and for the second Tajine of Lamb. These dishes are meant to be eaten by hand, which we did, but I saw some tables eating with cutlery. Full disclosure, the fruits do come with their labels unpeeled, though I wasn't too worried about that because they were the juiciest, sweetest batch I've had since coming to the States. \n\nWe were about to leave when the manager (owner?) emerged from the backroom and told us to stick around to see the belly dancer. I thought this was a really nice gesture, as the dancer had been hired by a large group upstairs and he really did not have to share this information with us.  \n\nMy one critique, if you can call it that, is directed at Marrakesh's decor. True to its Moroccan roots everything from the furniture to the walls is covered with dark, heavy fabric. Perhaps it is a personal bias, but I found the place to be a little stuffy, and I could not tell how clean everything was. All in all, a MUST TRY!",

The vibe -- especially the outdoor seating areas -- are great and fit the surrounding area.\n\nI ordered the Five Alarm burger, my M.L. Rose go to. I ordered the burger medium well, and it was served medium well -- a feat that seems to becoming less common. The spicy jalape\u00f1os and habanero jack cheese provided the classic kick that makes this burger so great in my books. The accompanying sweet potato waffle fries were delicious as always.\n\nI'll still default to the 8th Ave. location, but this is a fine substitute if I'm ever in west Nashville.",

Nick, our waiter, was very attentive, polite and friendly yet professional.  I did not see anyone working there that looked 14 so perhaps that is why I missed out on the love fest, (I would have filmed that for you all). All but one of the employees I saw were kept busy and acted professional.  There was one, ( a hostess I believe), who was possibly bored (?), and decided to amuse herself by plastering her face to the glass partition while making a few fishy type faces at the diners. While this may have counted as entertainment to some, I would have preferred the love fest that I could have filmed. Admit it. If I had been able to film that you would have watched. I took off a star for the bad entertainment.  Other than that, the place was clean, the food was good and reasonably priced,  Nick was awesome....I would recommend it to others.",

    "text": "This was a fun place to visit for a light dinner and some great entertainment with the kiddies! We caught a band called Washboard Rodeo, and they played some fun bluegrassy-type western swing. We'd made a 7:30 reservation via Open Table and were seated immediately. It's a small place, so any table you get is a good one. This is one of the few places on Frenchman Street that seems okay for children: mine are 9 and 11 and very capable of behaving well in a gastropub setting. The menu has a great baked mac & cheese and the waitresses are warm and welcoming. I have to say, after sampling the fish tacos, I sorta wish that I had ordered the mac & cheese, too! The tacos were okay but small and pretty bland. The mac & cheese was plentiful and well-seasoned. But this place is all about the music and the drinks, and on these they won me over. Had a simple Stella Artois apple cider (despite the great drink selection) and hubby enjoyed his porter. If you make a reservation, they give you 90 minutes to dine, which to me was more than enough. The band starts at 7pm on a weeknight, taking a 15-minute break around 8pm, and our 7:30 reservation gave us plenty of time to enjoy the music. If you visit New Orleans with older kiddies, I'd say give this place a go.",

I was the first to arrive so I sat at the bar and ordered the house cider which is great and I followed that with the Oban 18 which is phenomenal so try it while you're there. \n\nOur dinner kicked off with the most amazing house biscuits and butter that will have you begging for the recipe.\n\nThe rest of our dinner was comprised of several selections from the First course menu. We had the daily oysters which were great. Followed by the Brussels sprouts, delicious but the crispy chicken skins were a bit of a let down, they needed more flavor. \n\nThe smoked tuna tartar is great but the sweet chips can overwhelm the dish. Definitely get the marinated shrimp and jalape\u00f1o jus it is a wonderfully fresh and bright dish. \n\nTo close thing up we had the dobeger cake with lemon curd and chocolate ice cream, as if that wasn't enough they pour this amazing chocolate sauce on it when it arrives that will have you just dying as you wait to dig in.\n\nOverall Compere Lapin is a great addition to the New Orleans food scene, great for groups or date night with your significant other.",

I had been a couple of years ago during my first visit to St. Louis and I liked the pizza so much that I had to come back.\nI was the only person in the place. I came in at that weird time between lunch and dinner rush. Regardless, the bartender was super friendly. He chatted me up about all of the local beers they have. I finally settled on a Schlafly pumpkin because it's me and it's fall. I didn't have pizza on this visit (not because it isn't amazing because it is, but because I couldn't eat a whole pizza on my own). Instead I ordered a Cesar salad and the meatball appetizer. \nFirst off the salad was freaking huge!!! It was tasty for a Cesar salad though they really are hard to mess up. The meatball appetizer was awesome! You get about 5 meatballs in sauce and covered with cheese alongside a few pieces of bread. The salad and meatballs were the perfect lunch.\nI'll be back friends, as soon as work takes me to St. Louis again.",

They have $5 cocktail/draft beer specials and certain $2.50 bottles. They also have a number of bar eats for $5-$8. Per Yelp's recommendation I tried the Potted Pig and it was a fantastic plate of food. The pork confit has a pastey/tuna-like texture; on its own it's a tad too pork-y but with the pickled veg and grape chutney you get a nice balance of salty, sweet, and acid in each bite. I also appreciate that the bread is grilled and seasoned. These little details make a difference.\n\nI also like the ambience. Relaxed, rustic-hipster. They sell some of their own meats at the front counter - bonus points in my book.",

I was very disappointed in the satay being that you only get two small skewers. The flavor and peanut dipping sauce were very good but they give a few more skewers.  The Panang was good and you get a good size portion of rice.\n\nOn a side note, I was disappointed they do not have Pad See Ew. Still some other options on the menu I will return to try.\n\nThe staff and manager really know customer service.  Look forward to returning soon!",

When we looked at our menus, we realized they had significantly raised their prices since the last time (probably by 20-25% on the entrees).  We were unadventurous and both order the salmon with mustard butter sauce, which we've both really enjoyed in the past.  Unfortunately, my salmon was a little undercooked and my wife remarked that the salmon quality was not as good as before.  The sauce was definitely off as well--overly salty and not much of the good ground mustard flavor (I think they just went heavy on the salted butter).  The food was disappointing, especially since we were paying 20-25% more than the time before.",

This place also makes getting down and dirty with your food easy. There are sinks all over so you can rinse the mess off your hands once you're done....good touch.\n\nTo sum it up, Chickie's and Pete's is a Philadelphia institution and always a good time. I strongly suggest going at least once to enjoy the experience. \n\nPlease note: Make sure to remember two things before coming during major sporting events. 1. You'll never get a table and 2. You'll deal with a ton of drunk people. I've absolutely been one of these people before and we can get annoying unless you're in the right frame of mind. :)",

Last visit I went 4 and while it was definitely a \"sinus opening experience\" the food is pleasantly hot without any of the ill side-effects later on...if you know what I mean.\n\nThe menu has over 100 items on it and while some of the other reviews complain of the vegetables being \"not fresh\" I can only compare Aroy with the pricey city Thai I've had in/around St Louis and I put Aroy equal of better with HUGE portion sizes at very reasonable prices.\n\nEach visit I have found the service to be attentive and available.  Once during Saturday lunch rush and another post-lunch afternoon.\n\nWalk-in takeout service seemed very quick for those I observed on my visits.\n\nI've been to Thailand a few times and while you'll never beat home-cooked Thai with exported fare, I have nothing bad to say about Aroy Thai.

The ambiance and interior design are top notch. It's very impressive how the space has been transformed from the previous tenant. The food was outstanding, which is unsurprising considering the chef's pedigree. We had two lovely cocktails and a whole fish that was perfectly cooked along with a terrific short rib play on stroganoff. The only reason I'm not giving five stars is that those cocktails and two entrees ended up costing $140. The Love is really good, but it's also surprisingly expensive. Entrees are priced in the $30-$40 range and appetizers and pastas are not far behind. The Love bills itself as a neighborhood restaurant, and it would be, perhaps, the platonic ideal of that if the prices dropped by a third. As is, it's as expensive as any non-tasting menu restaurant in Philly. Is that worth it when you can eat for less up the block at Vernick, etc? I'm not totally sure. I'll definitely be back, and I hope the menu prices find an equilibrium with the awesome vibe and food--I'd love to make it a real regular haunt.",

They rarely visit so picking an awesome restaurant- a task assigned to me as the Philly resident- was very important. \n\nXochitl did not disappoint. The vibe is understated Old City- totes relaxing, trendy but traditional, doesn't take itself too seriously but your server knows everything about the menu and food and drink is masterfully executed. \n\nThe guacamole was fantastic (if it wasn't, I wouldn't even bother to post a review...) which is a basic requirement for Mexican restaurants. Check. \n\nSince we were feeling poor that night, my fianc\u00e9 and I went with tacos rather than a full-on entree. Fish tacos-can you make them spicy? Um, yeah.  Melt in your mouth. Spicy brisket tacos- also very tasty. There were no leftovers. Our server and bartender colluded to prepare a dessert drink for us, a little shot of tiramisu liqueur goodness. And it was perfect. \n\nI still can't say the name of this place correctly but I will definitely be back and I would recommend it to others. Mexican food done right is such a treat, and so nice to find in a fun place that has cool staff who can really deliver for a semi special occasion. \n\nWhen I go back. I am looking forward to trying one of the ceviches...",

Everyone was beyond gracious and accommodating. I have zero complaints about the staff. They would obviously go out of their way to help anyone. Every bartender, every catering staffer, every hotel desk person, all of them, were SO customer-service oriented. Excellent all around in this area.\n\nThe hotel rooms (standard room, paid $99 a night for a Fri. and Sat. in early August) look nice now because they are relatively new but I am not sure they will hold up over time. Very spacious for such a low price and the views are great. \n\nHowever, the room walls are paper-thin. I mean PAPER!! I heard everything (even the normal volume conversations -- in detail--- happening in the room next door). My neighbors also had a baby that cried for over 3 hours one day which made napping impossible. I have never heard so much through a hotel room wall before. This is a definite problem and I suspect they hear a lot about it from patrons.\n\nAnother review mentioned that the room lighting is bad. This is true. It was nearly impossible to put on makeup even though they had a nice magnification mirror in the bathroom. I tried every spot and couldnt find a place with lighting. I ended up sitting by the window because it was still daylight and holding up my tiny compact on the couch. This is a small but highly frustrating thing for a woman. \n\nThe shower and bathrooms are very nice in the rooms. High quality and the water was warm. I really liked the bathroom. So clean, too!\n\nThe TVs are pretty neat because you can check-out on them. \nThe free wi-fi was spotty and made me login again on their page over and over. \n\nThe AV in the meeting rooms was cruddy. The mics went in and out and had a lot of interference. However the system is built-in rather than set up like most AV places, so I guess you get what you pay for.\n\nThe art in all the conference rooms was gorgeous but it was so cold in all of them that I left my meeting to go defrost. I am not an \"always cold\" person -- lots of other people were frosty too.\n\nConference room catering was good for the most part. Some things were high quality and delicious, others felt and tasted very mediocre chain-like. Hit and miss.\n\nThe pool was always crowded with families. Not a relaxing environment at all. \n\nSpa service menu was very reasonably priced but not a lot of options. No deep tissue massage?!\n\nI would go back. I want to try the steakhouse.",

    "text": "I like it. The atmosphere is festive and there is a nice variety of music in Spanish. Service is attentive and they got my picky order straight.\n\nIt was a boring salad made with iceberg lettuce that could easily be improved by using romaine or something darker. My more culinary friend ordered the chicken soup and swears it is one of the best he has tasted. And this guy knows food. He is the type of person that has a hog slaughtered and knows what to do with the meat.\n\nSo it's a great place to go for chicken soup, and I heard the queso fundido is pretty darn good as well. Although it was recommended you order just the queso, and if you want chorizo, ask for it on the side because otherwise it gets a little greasy.",

    "text": "Been here a few times since my gf and I live by and like the outdoor seating area. The regular menu has always been pretty consistent with their fish & chips and old charlestown shrimp. Appetizers are a bit expensive for what you get but they are good. The staff has always been nice and offer to bring out water for our dog when bring him so thats huge for us.\n  We finally realized they had a happy hour and walked away with mixed results. The menu has a good selection between food and drinks at different prices. We had a few food items including the baja tacos, nachos and calamari. The ONE baja taco (for $5, reg $7.50) was good but for $5 i personally hoped for more than one or for something special with the tortilla. The fish itself was pretty damn good but the tortilla tasted fresh from the supermarket. Having been spoiled by fresh tortillas elsewhere this was disappointing. The nachos plate was packed but the plate was small so all the cheese and few beans were on top with nothing on the chips hidden below. But the calamari was very good and came with a good amount.\n  I would stick with the regular menu or if happy hour has to be tried stick with the drinks and calamari.",

    "text": "This was my second visit to Deja Brew - the first time ( which I didn't review) was an enjoyable dinner while being entertained by Katie G and the Half Macs (they were excellent, by the way). At that visit I had the Grilled Chicken Caesar Salad and two glasses of wonderful Cabernet Sauvignon. Service was great, ambiance superb!\n\nThis morning we tried Deja for breakfast. Service was different - we had to stand in line to order - one person on cash register, one making coffee, one delivering meals to tables and it appeared only one person in the kitchen. It seemed to me to be a slow and clunky way to do breakfast. After we ordered we were given a table number thing, which to our surprise, didn't mean drinks were delivered - they were called out from behind the coffee bar (noisy atmosphere and senior hearing doesn't make this a good system). My wife ordered a heated cinnamon roll and a side of bacon - she declared the bacon excellent, but the roll was delivered cold (she's too polite to send it back)! I ordered the Cheese & Bacon Grits. I love grits and have always eaten them \"creamy\", it seems Deja serves them baked - that was a surprise but even more surprising was that they were very good! Yes, said, very good.\n\nOverall, I would give the evening meal and service 5 stars and the breakfast 3. Except for the cold cinnamon roll all the food was very good and wait staff polite.",

This is the first place I ever felt offered an impressive selection of beers both on tap and canned/bottled. I also overheard the staff patiently help some patrons decide what to drink based on their preferences--some places get very impatient and just want you to pick something. That being said, servers were either very attentive or very busy, but that's to be expected. This is my new favorite spot in the Funk Zone!",

    "text": "Update: happy hour. 3.5 stars. I really hate to downgrade places I do genuinely like, but .. I have to be objective. I did my research on places downtown offering happy hour specials and based on what's advertised I picked Tryst for a gathering of 4. \nWe were seated promptly outside. The location and the view are excellent! The outside decor is cozy and elegant. I asked the hostess what the happy hour specials were and she told me they don't have any. I asked our waitress the same question, and she pointed to the section of the menu that lists the offerings. The happy hour specials before 7 pm are half off house wine, some beers, well liquor and appetizer specials. We took advantage of the half off house wine- excellent malbec! The problem was with the appetizers. There weren't any. The menu clearly states -half off appetizer specials.  We were told that they are in the process of changing the menu and currently there are no appetizer specials. My personal belief is that if something is offered, especially in writing, it should be honored and delivered. Oh, well...\nThe food- it was very good! I'm not a fan of calamari, and I would never order them. After tasting my friend's calamari I did put in my own order. They were that good- tender and juicy! The serving was very much on the small side.  \nThe bison carpaccio was very good as well. The house pesto underneath was absolutely delicious! \nWe also shared the pork tacos and a Cuban sandwich. Both were decent, nothing special, but nonetheless good. \nOur waitress, by the way, was fantastic! I have enjoyed her service before and she's always done a great job!",

I was pleasantly surprised when I was over prepared! \n\nPrepurchased tickets online, ate dinner else where (since other reviewers had suggested the food isn't good there), got there 30 minutes early. Purchased my 10oz glass of wine & bottled water ($18.50 total. Ouch!) at the bar, and walked in with them in hand as one reviewer suggested. Got seated in freshly wiped seats (saw the guy cleaning & it smelled like bleach), and 3-4 servers began to take orders from the room. They were really hustling! All of the food looked like generous portions and looked yummy to Me. Seemed to all be out before the movie started. Unfortunately, I didn't order anything. \n\nI did notice that there aren't any call buttons like I have experienced at other similar luxury theaters. There didn't appear to be a mid-movie service either. \n\nI'd say the owner saw the yelp reviews & quickly took action because I just didn't experience the negatives that have been complained about over the last few months. I'll update when I get a chance to actually dine there.",

We usually sit at the habachi tables although their dining room menu is just as good. We love their sushi. It is a great place for date night. It is family friendly, although I wish they offered more for young children. They do not have milk and only have a small variety of juices (2-3 usually and since my daughter doesn't like cranberry, orange or pineapple juice, we are usually bring our own).  The little ninja menu is great for older kids but it's too big and too pricey for a toddler. I usually just order a side of rice for our daughter and we both give her some of our meat/veggies.",

    "text": "Nestled on the corner of 20th and Chestnut, it looks bigger than what you'll discover inside. A tight-knit community of tables, all filled, whether reservations can be made or not, saddled around a long bar, and some standing room to place your beer and food, if standing is fine. \n\nWander in at 6:00 on a Saturday, and are told its a 2 hour wait for a table. Bar is a much better option. Was able to grab a seat at the bar as soon as we got in. \n\nBartenders are friendly. The wall of whiskey (or whisky) behind the bar is quite impressive. \n\nFood is quite delicious. Village burger with sauteed onions and blue cheese is quite the tasty treat. Burger is cooked a shade under what you request, which for medium, a bit redder is fine by me. The wife got a pulled pork sandwich, and salivated over every bite. A side order of duck fat fries in a cheese sauce compliments the meal well. \n\nPricing is surprisingly reasonable. Definitely on the list as a repeat place to go.",

    "text": "We're from San Diego, where there is plenty of good Laatin-American food, so on this trip to visit my husband's family, (as we do periodically), we remembered how much we like Delicia, and came back here.  What a treat! (Hint - Delicia, you'd do really well in San Diego if you opened another restaurant there, and we'd comee to visit you often!)\n\nThe service was good; the atmosphere was nice, and the food was AMAZING!  \n\nWe started with the Guacamole, the Ceviche, and the Queso Fundido.  The Quac was okay, but I prefer it simple, with less stuff in it.  The Queso Fundido was delicious, as was the Cevice.\n\nOh - the specialty cocktails were interesting and refreshing.  I was surprised, though that when I asked for a Kioki Coffee, the waiter said he didn't know what it was and they couldn't serve me one.  Really?  Usually, if they haven't heard of it, they'll Google it, and then fix one for me. Nope.  But they did serve me a delicious Irish Coffee.\n\nThe entrees were the stars of the meal.  Among the four of us, we had the duck enchiladas (Enchiiladas de Pato), the Aji  a la Gallino (a chicken dish), and the Tamal Corn Cakes.  All three were presented beautifully and were outstanding.  The rice served with them was very bland., but the entrees themselves were spectacular., with the Corn Cakes (served with Barbacoa Beef) were my favorite.  \n\nGenerous protions.  I took half of mine home for lunch the next day and enjoyed it just as much@\n\nWhen I left, I was sad - sad that we only come here once or twice a year and we won't be able to come back until then!  What was good was soooo good, that they get five stars despite the minor flaws.  \n\nMany gluten-free options too, which was wonderful for one in our group!",

Open bar seating for walk-ins made it possible to eat dinner during prime time and a sold out restaurant\n3. The bartender was very attentive and provided great service, made us feel like valued guest\n\nWhat I didn't like:\n1.  Overly trendy vibe, definitely a see and be seen crowd\n2. The pork meatball wasn't my favorite - a little too greasy and lacked flavor\n3. Asparagus with egg- usually one of my favorites, but the asparagus was a little too soggy for my taste\n\nOverall Verdict: Worth trying, but not high on my list as a local, feels like it's trying a little too hard and not the best, authentic Italian.  I would say it's a good option for grabbing a quick bite at the bar with a glass of wine after work- try the gnocchi!  If you're looking for amazing pasta, would say to try Rolf and Daughters",

The Enchiladas Mexicanos  is a mixed plate of one beef, one chicken, and one cheese each with different sauces which comes with the standard rice and beans.  I like how their salsa tastes a bit smoky as though they put a little chipotle in it.  The service has been ok.  If I'm in the mood to imbibe, I opt for a beer.

When I told her I didn't want to spend that much, she wasn't offended and actually made me a modified drink with 151 that cost $8 but packed the punch of a long island. There was a $10 minimum for credit cards so the bartender gave me a beer in addition, which I gave to a friend.

    "text": "This place gets a solid 4 stars from me. This past Sunday at 12:40 at night (I guess that would make it Monday by then...) I got the biggest craving for a pizza. I called around to a few places to try to find someone open but came up empty handed. That was when my boyfriend recalled a place called Imperial Pizza that his buddies talked about. Sure enough they were open and we put our order in and in 10 minutes it was ready for pick up. Not gonna lie, it was not the BEST pizza I ever had. But for 6 bucks and being the only place open to serve me at that hour it was pretty damn good.\n\n A few nights later around the same time I got a craving for a cheese steak. I decided to try one from there. Eh. They had no wiz so I got it with american and it was an 8 inch roll. Not that much meat on the sandwich and the roll was pretty chewy. BUT it cost me 5 dollars I believe. For 5 dollars I can't really complain about it to much. \n\nI know I'll be heading back there soon enough for more pizza when I'm up late at night. You got a fan here!",

It's a nice dining option if you don't want to go downtown Indy or struggle with street parking in Zionsville or downtown Carmel.  The atmosphere is family friendly, with ample space between tables.  The hostess was very kind to switch our table to accommodate a stroller.  Pasta dishes are a generous portion! Loved the pancetta wrapped breadsticks with burata cheese.  Nice selection of authentic Italian desserts. We can only speak for the wild berry gelato which was a nice finish to a excellent pasta meal. The presentation of the wine list was unique-showing a map of Italy with the different regions and the wine selection.  Also, a good number of choices for wine by the glass.  A couple of small suggestions, one-some of us eat pasta with the assistance of a large spoon-our waiter didn't quite understand my request and brought a small one.  Second, most of us like parmesan on our pasta, so please come prepared to offer it.  Finally the legs on the chairs in the small dining room are extremely slippery and did present an awkward experience when adjusting our seats.",

    "text": "I heard this ice cream parlour opened last summer, so upon my first trip home (sometime during the fall) I hustled over to try it. Since Friendly's closed a few years ago, Warminster has sorely needed a new ice cream place (DQ was our last one standing for quite some time). \n\nMuch to my dismay, the Big Scoop had already closed for the season. I marked it in my calendar go return in March, when it reopened. Upon my next trip home in the spring, I was disappointed to see that I was just a few days early for their reopening, and would have to wait until my return in April.\n\nAfter much anticipation, I made it to Big Scoop last weekend with my sister (who has been before). I was shocked to see what a range of products they serve - hot dogs, funnel cake, onion rings, pizza, you name it! I was tempted at the prospect of waffles and ice cream, but I wasn't that hungry so I settled for a scoop of chocolate chip cookie with hot fudge and whipped cream. The generous scoop of ice cream was tasty and packed with globs of cookie dough! I also tasted the birthday cake, which I enjoyed very much. \n\nThe service was quick, and the shop crowded quickly. The interior was nicely remodeled and looks clean and family friendly. The man who helped me was extremely courteous and seemed to be doing most of the work. \n\nEspecially given the lack of competition around here, the Big Scoop gets an easy four stars!",

My friend was visiting from out of town and he ordered the beef taco and chicken fajitas and thought they were pretty average. However, he agreed that the fish tacos were amazing. Since 2 full me up and they're only like $2.60 each it's a pretty happy visit all round for me! Plus the interior and patio are awesome\n(And there's Ben and Jerry's right next door for dessert)",

It's not as big of a place as I had imagined it would be, but the setup was cozy and not too cramped.  We were greeted and seated right away, with drinks soon to follow.  Our server was friendly and knowledgeable about the menu.   I ordered a \"u pick 2\" soup and sandwich.  Dill pickle potato soup, which was exactly like it sounds....delicious!  And the Blackhawk sandwich came on a soft fluffy Vienna roll with rare roast beef, roasted red pepper, lettuce, tomato, and a goat cheese spread.  I could have used a touch more of the goat cheese, but, for less than $8, it was a great lunch.  Oh, yeah....there was a side of Billy Goat chips too  =)\n\nThe reason I didn't give The Fountain a 5 star rating was my dessert.  I ordered the Johnny Rabbit Monkey Malt: a chocolate malt blended with bananas.  I am a malted freak, and was  a little disappointed when it came out...not very thick, and not very malty.  I figured out why when i got to the bottom of the metal shaker cup and all the malt powder was stuck to the bottom of the cup.  Next time I'll stick with a sundae.  And there WILL be a next time....soon.",

I have to say, I'm not as impressed as I thought I would be. \n\nWalking into district donuts, you get a very clean and nice hipster vibe. Their \"extra fancy\" donuts are on display by the cashier. They're very nicely decorated and look delicious.\n\nWe ordered the pork belly sliders, Vietnamese iced coffee donut, brown butter donut, coffee, chocolate milk, and an espresso shot. The caffeine was nothing to write home about but the chocolate milk was very good - just sweet enough.\n\nThe pork belly slider in my opinion wasn't very good. It needed more daikon radish and the cut of pork belly wasn't fatty enough.\n\nThe donuts are very sweet. Almost too sweet. The Vietnamese coffee donut didn't have enough coffee flavor to it.

First off Franklin is probably the nicest town in tennessee, it has a New England feel and maybe that is why I love it so much (being from there most of my life).\n\nNow the restaurant itself has excellent food and service, I have only been two times but I am yet to have anything that isn't absolutely delicious. The steak was cooked perfectly and was very tender (not the best I've ever had but close). Now the steak is good, but the shrimp and grits is spectacular. I would rank it in one of my top 20 meals of all time!! \n\nLast of all they have a great beer selection with many interesting choices on tap. This restaurant would get 5 stars from me, but it is to small and gets very crowded. Just go on a week night. You will have one of the best meals in Nashville!",

The interior was no different from the outside.

Our waitress was nice and professional and food was quick to arrive. We got a dozen oysters, blackened alligator, and seafood basket. Oysters were fresh, the alligator was tasty, and the seafood were cooked perfectly. \n\nOverall, this was a nice restaurant outside of downtown NOLA.

Only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is because it is a tourist-trap place that has astronomically priced meals. You're probably going to get that anywhere in this area of the city though. However, if you're wanting to try any Creole/New Orleans-specific means; they have it here. Great place to go if you're wanting to get a flavor for NOLA!",

The sound in this theater is so quiet u can hear ur neighbors eating their food... Wish the sound was better. The prices r reasonable and worth it cuz movie theater food is normally expensive anyway. Other than the sound this cinema is definitely worth coming to atleast for a try. Overall it was a really fun experience\n:-)",

The large hoagie is enough for two and they will package onions, peppers etc on the side so you can share and still get your half the way you want it.  Our favorites are the Italian and the turkey with oil instead of mayo.  Call ahead as they can take a while to make, especially if you order several (we had four on Saturday).

I mean like my last meal on earth would be a burger. Or, just maybe, the fajita wrap. Because it's that good.\n\nHaven't had everything on the menu yet, but everything I have had has been great. The buffalo bella and crispy hipcity ranch are amazing sandwich alternatives, especially paired with the green lemonade. The groothie is also delicious, and can stand on its own to get you through an afternoon if you only want to spend a few bucks.\n\nOkay suffice it to say that the food is great. The staff is also very friendly, and when they get busy someone will come out along the line and take orders so congestion doesn't get too bad at the register itself.\n\nMy only issue with HipCity is that it is at times nearly impossible to figure out where to stand when you're waiting to order or waiting for your food. People kind of convene everywhere and it can get awkward when there's a line out the door. In such a small space it's hard to rectify, but if I see a line out the door I tend to walk on by not because it's a long wait (they're really efficient), it's just difficult to navigate the interior.",

I helped myself to the basic burger, which I asked for cooked all the way, and was pleasantly not dry at all. You know what else was delightful? Their homemade ketchup! Perfectly sweet and perfectly ketchupy.\n\nThe order did take a bit longer to come out than I would have liked, but watching my sassy non-robot server make lots of different drinks for other customers ameliorated the pain of the wait.

But this place is all about the kitsch factor- keep your expectations in check and ignore the sour puss servers and you'll enjoy the visit. Ask for one of the soap opera booths :)",

My mom and I frequently go to On The Border for margaritas because they are delicious! If you go during the summer, you must try the watermelon margarita. :-) the only complaint I have ever had here is their service. On The Border is frequently getting new employees who aren't always as attentive as you'd like your service to be. It is common to wait long periods of time for your bill or even need a refill for chips and a drink.",

    "text": "This is one of our frequent late-night stops, after we've gotten tired of the loud bars and are looking for a more quiet but still lively place to wrap up a night. We always go on Saturday nights and have never had to wait for a spot at the bar.\n\nI actually don't drink liquor, so village WHISKEY may seem like an odd choice of locations, but they have a fantastic beer selection too. Honestly, I stopped here because it's a Garces joint and I would drink toilet water if he put it in a bowl with some cilantro. Plus, my boyfriend loves their whiskeys. And so do the other guests, which makes this place so fun: the last time we were there we ended up joining booths with our neighbors so that we could all talk about the restaurant and their liquor choices. It's a very cool, very like-minded crowd.\n\nFood wise you can't go wrong with duck fat french fries. I feel like I don't even need to say that, because come on... duck. fat. french. fries. We also go for the cheese puffs on their late night menu as well: a hot pan of ping-pong ball sized bread balls coated in cheese and broiled and delicious and... oh boy now I'm, hungry.\n\nAnd if the other reviews aren't clear enough... their burgers will have you singing hymns of praise to the meat gods.",

The pizza is off the wall the Italians wouldn't believe what these guys can do with a little dough I highly recommend the buffalo chicken pizza it will blow your socks right off !

PROS: The baristas are great (I can only think of 2-3 out of 25+ situations that weren't great), energy is great (easy to feel comfortable whether you're getting some alone time or meeting with folks -- indoor and outdoor community tables are fantastic), the food and pastries are well-made (MAKE SURE you try the raspberry-ricotta scone -- BEST EVER), great non-coffee beverage options (which can be rare!). CONS: Not too many outlets for laptop use (not a HUGE deal, but there have been a few times I've come with business to do and had to leave), the method they use to brew coffee can leave some hefty silt that makes coffee thick and sometimes bitter (we're splitting hairs now -- just get the Americano instead, it's great), there have been a few times my food has taken a while, so it's good to set yourself (and others) up for success by not being in a rush. Honestly, a few minor things notwithstanding, I really love this place. I love what they do for my neighborhood. I couldn't be more grateful that I live a block away.",

    "text": "From the outside of the Cafe, you don't really expect the inside to be that great.  But to my surprise, it was greatly decorated in Thai decor.  I liked the ambience and feel to it, because it kind of made me feel like it was an exotic escape especially from the surrounding neighborhood.  \n\nThere was plenty of seating which was great.  Most Thai restaurants I've visited have been a little smaller and more intimate, and this place gives you enough breathing room.  Coming from Chicago, my favorite place near the UIC Campus was Thai Bowl on Taylor St.  Cheap and good Thai food with a student discount and delivers to the dorms.  \n\nThe food was great, and having a Thai friend order food that I wasn't familiar with was all the better.  I'm more of an \"eat what you know\" type of person, and sometimes I'm scared to venture out.  But the Tom Kha (sp?) - Coconut (Milk) Soup was delicious.  I have to say I'm not a fan of either mushrooms or coconut, but I have to say it was a great combination.    Now to my usual order of Pad See Ew, I wasn't too impressed.  It seems like this place, along with Smiling Elephant and Royal Thai, all make their Pad See Ew with thinner (almost transparent) noodles.  I enjoy having my Pad See Ew with thicker noodles, that's basically my only complaint.  \n\nThe service was great because I went during a less busy time (I'd say mid-afternoon).  \n\nI'm definitely coming back here again.   This place beats Royal Thai.  And I would probably choose this place over Smiling Elephant because Siam Cafe has more seating available.",

I was feeling kind of sick that day, so I opted for a chicken taco salad (which I judged to be a mild and non-offensive menu choice). I was shocked at how delicious a taco salad could be. I could have drank the cumin vingarette out of a glass. I was also instantly jealous, and began feeling better, when I saw what some of the other folks I was with ordered to eat. One person got the brisket and another got the pulled pork sandwich, and the aromas that were entering my nose were soothing and enticing. \n\nBottom line: I'd like to go back and be more adventurous with my meal choice.",

    "text": "This place started for us as a quick stop to grab a bubble tea for my wife and I. It was nice and convenient, located very close to my wife's work. On days that I would show up early to pick her up from work, I would find myself coming up with excuses to get a bubble tea for her and a smoothie for myself. This practice has aided in earning me a brownie point or two over the years. The quality of the smoothie/ bubble tea bar is 5-star.\n\nAbout 1 year ago a Taiwanese friend of ours paid us a visit, and we decided to try the actual restaurant. They have plenty of the typical American Chinese food such as orange chicken, but our friend recommended actual Taiwanese dishes. The results were a little mixed. Some of the dishes were absolutely amazing, while others were quite weird. Overall the quality was very good (based on the opinion of our Taiwanese friend), even if some of the dishes were a little outside our comfort zone.\n\nTo sum it up, if you want a good bubble tea or smoothie, you won't find much better in Reno. If you want to give legitimate Taiwanese food a try, this is a great place to start.",

Jazz music was playing and I felt at home. \n\nFirst of all, I could not have been more grateful for the fresh loaf of bread we were given. We devoured it in a matter of minutes. Then came the gumbo ya-ya. It was spicy and savory and everything I expected from a gumbo. Finally came the bbq shrimp. We had been warned that these shrimp did come with their heads and tails on. Bibs were placed around our necks and we were off. The shrimp were some of the most rich and delicious ones I have ever tasted. The sauce they were served with was divine. Although it was messy, there is no other dish on the menu I would have traded for this.\n\nOverall, service was friendly and quick at Mr. B's. The food was delicious, although a little pricey.

This place saved my vacation....literally\n\nMy fiance's family has a beach home in Carpenteria where we have been staying for our very first vacation since having our 8 month son. Needless to say it has been a much needed vacation, that's why when I got a nasty cold over Labor Day weekend I was determined to speed up the healing process so I could enjoy the rest of my stay. Being from Los Angeles we have our pick of health food stores on every corner and all I can say is it was a pleasant surprise to walk into Pacific Health Foods and see products of the highest quality in health and nutrition. \n\nWhile waiting to pay I heard another customer speaking to an employee  (I believe a family owner) who was EXTREMELY knowledgeable about the ins and outs of eating to fight disease. If you are suffering from anything or know someone who is I would recommend going in and picking her brain! \n\nI have been every day to get a veggie juice and a shot of wheatgrass, my fiance loved their mango smoothie and the green acai bowl was a yummy/healthy lunch alternative when everyone else was cooking up burgers. They also offer local \"cold-pressed\" veggie juice, which unlike non-cold pressed holds the nutrients longer allowing me to take it home to drink later and fight off my cold. \n\nI got sick on the 2nd and today is the 5th, I woke up this morning feeling amazing...\n\nThanks Pacific Health Foods, you have a good thing going!",

Nice Greek wine list with beers and Greek liquors.  Staff is knowledgeable and very helpful.  We've been here several times and never disappointed.   Busy place but they handle it well.  Great appetizers (ump-Pagels) and big selection of great Greek dessert.  We shared a Gyro platter with 3 appetizers and dessert and price was less than $40.  Great buy for exquisite lunch.   I will return.",

My memory was the food was amazing but the atmosphere was a little too claustrophobic grandmas french parlor (reminded me of some old school places i went to in France and Belgium).  What I experienced this time was mouth watering, buttery rich satisfying impeccable dishes, as well as a cleaner more updated venue.  It was packed for a weeknight, and when you go there you will know why.  This is a true Tucson gem!",

    "text": "Love this place, it's a casual Hispanic place with great family style food. I call it family style as I feel like I am eating at a Hispanic friend's house and their grandma is cooking. They have a bunch of fresh quick favorites in the steam table like roast pork and yellow rice or black beans and rice, but today I picked something I have had there before and loved, chicken fingers. I know crazy right? But it's the best and always fresh made. They make it like my grandma, fresh breaded and quick fried. That and a side of rice and nice big bowl of their amazing Spanish Bean soup/ garbanzo and I am in culinary heaven. This is my go to place for great comfort food. Cubans are pretty good here too. But I go there on the days when they have Spanish Bean soup and I would put theirs up against any of the good ones in Ybor City, yes it is that good, but sadly not on the menu every day. Call ahead, I do. Try it and they got ya!",

The omelettes are great, I didn't try anything sweet so can't say how were the pancakes or French toasts. But the menu has so many different options and they all looked very good specially the sandwiches. I had an egg Benedict which was ok, nothing wrong with it but nothing great either, portion size was huge. My wife had an omelette with onions and American cheese which was very good ( again I liked her order better than mine lol). You pay the bill at the counter after you finish eating .

JB Dawson's is far better.\nAwesome experience from the second we stepped in, hostess greeted us with a smile and time to table waiting expectation.  We were promptly seated, and tended to right away with a smile and good attitude by a server, Nancy, who helped us with a beverage and app order.  \n\nFor our app we shared the twisted shrimp as it was Twisted Tuesday.  Nancy told us this dish far surpassed Bone Fish's Bang Bang Shrimp, to our surprise, it clearly did.  Our beverage and app shortly followed. \n\nShortly there after another server stopped by, Kyle, who was our designated server.  Boy, smile, great greeting, great attitude, engaging.  We talked a bit, figured our way through the menu and placed our order.\n\nFor our dishes, my wife selected the Four Cheese Mac & Cheese side -- Sharp Cheddar, Pepperjack, Mozzarella & Reggiano dusted with bread crumbs with cornbread as she had large lunch.  Very good.  Unexpected, light, not overly creamy, not burnt, just right.  And the corn bread with maple butter..... ahhhhhh that was really nice.\n\n I ordered the fish tacos-- 3 Flour tortillas, seasoned tilapia, chimichurri sauce, mango cilantro salsa & a lime cream drizzle.  Passed on starch sides and had their asparagus that was cooked to perfection.  To my surprise the they were filling, nice size portion (see photo)  not a two bite app.  Very moist and super fresh fish.\n\nGreat first experience all around expect one key aspect.  Their so called craft beer menu was really limited and did not contain a variety of types; focused more on IPAs.  Limited thinking for the bar manager I must say.  Kyle our waiter also bar-tends.  We got to talking and he offered with no questions to swap out my beer for another option --- Stoudts Scarlet, which is a reddish beer.  For my beer palette it was better then the others limited options had a nice taste at the swallow then waned off.   Kyle informed us that they buy for all 4 restaurants and try to find a middling that works across the 4 guest demographics.  Not a great decision honestly.  There are so many great craft brewers in the Bucks County region and even Bristol area that should be showed cased and tested through.  For me a bad or poor beer selection stunts the overall experience.\n\nWe'll be back but I may need to sneak in my own beer selections from my craft collection.",

I have tried other food here, all great, but those are my favs. \n\nOnly thing that is kinda hit n miss is the service. We have had some good waiters here but also some, not so good. Some are very attentive while others have ignored us the entire meal. \n\nThe food is consistently good so I guess we can overlook the staff issue but if they could just become consistent with a good staff I would give them 5 stars for sure.",

    "text": "For years, I have lamented about the lack of good cajun food in Philly. Thank you, Beck's, for filling this GAPING void. I think the first time I tried this place, it may have been in part because the line at Dinic's was unbearably long and the throngs of people waiting were spilling over into Beck's stall space (they are next to each other)... and boy am I glad my inner fatty couldn't wait another minute because I just don't know what I'd do without this jumbalaya! \n\nI will note that the service here is a bit terrible. Don't get me wrong - everyone is very nice, but ... SLOW-moving. VERY slow moving. I have never seen a more inefficient operation in my life, but like I said, they are super pleasant and helpful so you forgive them for taking 10+ minutes to pack  your order and collect payment (note: I've been there at least 4x and it's been true every single time). \n\nAs an example of the employees' niceness/helpfulness, as an FYI, they do let you sample pretty much any of the entrees so you can make sure it's not too spicy or too peppery etc for you.\n\nAlso, no credit card machine here so bring CASH.\n\nWHAT WE ATE\n*Jumbalaya: perfect. perfect. AND it's surprisingly spicy! It's less saucy then some jumbalayas I have had, but still really flavorful and the rice is perfectly cooked. They also usually spoon on a bit of sauce on top and adds that extra flavor. IF you get the right cashier, she will upsell you the cornbread - GET IT - and eat it TOGETHER. They're not messing around when they say the cornbread + jumbalaya flavors complement each other like whoa.  \n\n*Etouffee - the flavors of the bell peppers were a bit TOO strong for my personal liking, but I could appreciate the complexity of the flavors and the spiciness here as well. My friends really liked this dish, so I did want to mention. \n\n*Oyster Po'Boy - I thought the fried oyster was great. The breading they use to coat the po boy sandwich meats (and oysters) are really tasty and not overwhelming. I wish there was more oyster in the sandwich itself, but that would be the only complaint. \n\n*Beignets - warm and delightfully light fried dough and generous dusting of powdered sugar make this dessert just decadent enough. \n\n*Praline cookies - these were decent, but not the best I've ever had. The color was a bit darker than I was used to (more coffee with a splash of milk rather than latte color) and it almost tasted like they had burned/overcooked the butter or brown sugar. \n\nBeck's also has this authentic root beer from New Orleans available. I'm not a root beer fan so haven't tried, but I keep hearing awesome things about it.",

The setup when entering is a little awkward but after making my way back I was anxious to decide which flavor I was going to try. When I saw they had a bread pudding ice cream the decision was easy (you can pretty much guarantee I'll try anything bread pudding related). I selected the single scoop in a waffle cone which was a nice sized scoop and was quickly out the door to enjoy the frozen goodness. The ice cream was nice and creamy but the frozen bread chunks (at least I think that's what they were) were a little odd for me. The waffle cone was fresh and crispy and the perfect accent to finish off the ice cream. It was a nice, tasty, refreshing treat, but a little expensive for a cone in my opinion.",

    "text": "During my visit last week, I ate so many shrimp tacos I couldn't walk. In retrospect, I should have been overjoyed, because I would have had an excellent excuse to post up in the dingy (charming?) dining room and eat so many shrimp tacos I couldn't breath. It would have been worth it, because they're awesome. \n\nDuring dinner, $8.00 and tax gets you three tacos of your choice, beans, rice, pickled onions and radishes, limes, and a 16 oz. cup of fresh juicy heaven. I went with shrimp, my husband mixed it up with fish and shrimp. Lemme break it down: \n\nTortillas: Fresh, handmade, substantial without being dense. Impossibly moist and flexible. How are these not crumbling apart in my hand? This is a tortilla that can stand up to some serious manhandling, which is exactly what I did to my tacos. I would like to note that I would manhandle these on their own as a snack, or filled with cheese and green chiles. \n\nShrimp: Crispy until the end. Moderately battered. I won't say lightly - someone's dragging these through the batter with a heavyish hand, but I'm happy to say they're cooked perfectly and thoroughly enough that you don't encounter any flavorless globs of doughy disappointment. Just pure, deep fried ecstasy. \n\nSauce: White sauce of indeterminable origin. Mayonnaise? Vinegar? Crema? DELICIOUS. Cooly, tangy, and sour in the best way possible. Really the great unifier - bringing together while still accentuating the hot, crispy, shrimp, crunchy cabbage, and dense corn tortilla. \n\nBeans & Rice: Solid. Substantial. You're going to eat them. \n\nHorchata: Dude said people show up just for the horchata and I believe him. This doesn't come out of a fountain, and I'm not just saying that because I watched as it got ladled out of some giant tub resting on the counter top. You can taste the rice. This drink has texture, and what appears to be giant, lovely flecks of cinnamon bark. \n\nPina/Mango Juice: Fortifying. So tasty. Chunks of fresh pineapple. This might be my new Gatorade. \n\nTaqueria Pico De Gallo, come onnnnnnnn. Why so good?",

I almost forgot dessert...an entire side of the room is dedicated to a table full of desserts AND a chocolate fountain. The brunch price also include bottomless mimosas which were literally bottomless. Our server never let us empty our glasses and  the mimosas were very heavy on the champagne, so we all got a bit tipsy. At least the alcohol let us forget how much weight we gained during this meal.\n\nAs if the buffet spread wasn't enough, they also have an a la carte menu with small dishes. The choices included Belgian waffles, french toast, blintzes, Mahi, and a few other savory dishes.  You can order as many of these items as you want, as many times as you want. Our server was sure to remind us of this, she seemed to enjoy watching how gluttonous our table was! \n\nUnfortunately we were here during Tropical Storm Debby, so we didn't get to enjoy a beautiful view of the bay, Although, being here while the weather was so awful was very cozy with the fireplace and wood interior. Thanks to the weather it wasn't crowded either, so don't write this place off on account of bad weather. \n\nAt $35 a person, the Sunday brunch seems pricey, but if you have no qualms about overeating and overdrinking, you'll definitely get your money's worth.",

We were able to get a seat on the patio.  Our waitress was very attentive, even coming back at one point to tell us our food was on its way.  I had the turkey sandwich, which had great flavor.  Overall, I would still avoid The Peak during late nights (just because it's not really my scene - and even less so as I realize I'm getting older!), but it's great for lunch and a week night dinner.",

    "text": "This shopping center is a nice asset to Tucson.  Although I have my own likes and dislikes about this place, it's an overall nice high end place to find the special something you are looking for.  My dissapointment with this place, is there is a lack of a department store.  This place doesn't have to have three or five, but at least one would be a nice addition to the area.  It would also lure more shoppers as well.  I personally think a Nordstrom or Bloomingdale's would fit there... Not sure of a Neiman Marcus or Saks, I could be wrong... perhaps there are enough people willing to shop the latter two?  I do love the Firebirds Steakhouse... their steaks are mouth watering and just to die for!",

Spicy and peppery, just how I like it. \n\nMy sandwich was incredible. I ordered it with a poached egg. The egg was completely overdone so I asked them to bring me a new egg. They apologized and said they would, and I thought that was the end of it. They brought me a new egg AND an order of their bonuts. Unexpected but great customer service. I don't love sweets but I had one (my boyfriend gratefully inhaled the rest of them!) but I had one and it was very tasty. But good customer service goes a really long way, especially over such a small issue! \n\nThe hot chicken was delicious! Would come here every weekend if I lived there.",

So I walked in told them I was dying of hunger and they came out were very friendly and went ahead and gave us the standard chips and water. Perfect, now everything is getting better because I have something to coat my stomach...I don't need anything special so I just ask the waiter where the enchiladas are without really looking at the menu and says \"2 enchiladas coming up\".  I love it.  Then I looked over and saw someone that had margaritas -- and I really really wanted one but I was trying to not drink that night.  Man, Michas delivered and they gave me extra fillers to fatten me up.  I walked out feeling good about this experience and I will absolutely go back here again. Legit 4 estrellas.",

Because, their great sales made my budget for \"Secret Santa\" at work go further. I wasn't even looking here and found a perfect gift as I entered and it was 50% off. More gifts, the merrier the recipient. \n\nI am also a fan of their photo lab. It is so easy to submit pictures via the Walgreens app. Once my photos are ready to pick-up, they'll text me. Then all I have to do is jump in the car and drive up Hampton a couple of blocks. It usually takes less then two hours and the quality is good. \n\nI don't use the pharmacy, but this is my go-to for over the counter drugs. The prices are good and I've never seen them out of stock for any of the products I use. \n\nIt is a busy Walgreen's as everyone has stated. So have patience when it is time to check-out. Management is quick to open additional registers when a line starts to form. \n\nWill I return? - I support my hood, even if it is a chain store. \n\nWhen: December 13, 2017\nWhy: Photos and Secret Santa Shopping",

As a visitor, I reached out on Facebook asking if they could make a reservation for two for brunch. I don't believe they normally make reservations, but they were very kind and willing. As soon as we arrived, they had our seat ready and they were expecting us.\n\nOur meals were tasty, I had the Chicken or the Egg special, and loved the $15 bottomless drinks, which you could switch out between a bloody mary, mimosa and sangria for no extra cost. Our waitress was very friendly.\n\nTo top it all off, the owner/head chef visited our table as he knew we were \"the people from Facebook.\" He thanked us for our business, chatted with us about our hometown for a while and gave us his business card with personal cell phone number for us to call if we needed anything while we were in town!

Since Buddy Brew is such a Tampa institution, the shop can get kind of crowded which is what demotes it to 4 stars for me.

I took my mum here for her birthday for lunch and we were both so pleased!! \n\nSad to say, but due to some health issues, I've had to really change my diet around. This was my first time going out to eat since being on this new regimen. I'm definitely limited, which is too bad, and there was a lot I couldn't have. The menu has good selections, but there is a lot with meat, and I've been a vegetarian for years. Regardless, they serve great food, I just like big menus. Everything is made in house and they use fresh and local ingredients. My mum got the Vermonter salad, which she LOVED!!! It had mixed greens, Vermont cheddar, applewood smoked bacon, pecans, and dried cherries. The dressing was a home made honey vinaigrette I believe. It came with two delicious pieces of muesli bread with a home made honey butter. YUM!! I had the tuna plate, which was great too. It had a very good portion of tuna salad, mixed greens, mixed veggies, and came with a biscuit with that delicious honey butter. It also came with a fresh fruit bowl!!!! I couldn't have the biscuit so I traded for muesli and man that stuff was delicious. My mum loves the biscuit too. Everything is definitely made with love and happiness here!!!\n\nThe patio is so cute, 4 tables on a nice little deck with fans and hanging lights. Our server was wonderful, SO kind and adorable. She even brought my mum\na homemade red velvet cupcake with a candle, which LOOKED amazing, and she thought was delicious. Another win at Wildflower, would love to come back for breakfast sometime.",

No problem at all...just grabbed a Victory Brew from the bar while we waited. Now that's a beer that get's better every single time I have it...(or, maybe I'm just developing a resistance to the bitterness that I remember from college???). Anyway, it went down mighty easily, and over the years, I've learned the hard way that drinking too many of them will instill upon you in the next day some of the worst feelings known to man.  Awh, heck...as they say \"Victory Comes at a Price\" :)\n\nSo there I was, thinking that we would be the only idiots eating dinner that late, but...this is West Chester, on a Saturday night...(I was wrong)! The place was crowded and loud, but nothing that would draw you away.   A very nice waitress seated us in the back at a large round table, and we had drinks & menus in no time at all.  These people were working towards the end of what was likely a very long & hectic shift, but they still managed to seem like they were enjoying being there. Very polite, and easy smiles. As I've learned from sisters & friends once in that line of work....being fake is what waitress do very well!     Anyway, there are good reasons this place was so busy. The menu is large, the atmosphere was pleasant, the food was delicious, and I'll definitely go back there again...maybe on a weeknight that's hopefully less crowded.  Not too pricey either, considering where & what it is.  Two thumbs up!",

On the way back to the hotel we spied what looked like a pub at which to kill time before another restaurant opened.\n\nI was more than pleasantly surprised by the beer menu, and the \"snacks,\" including one of the best cheese plates I've ever tasted had us thinking we might have to cancel our other dinner reservations. To round out a meal, my wife had a fish dish with \"smushy peas\" and I had the sage/apple/pumpkin risotto.\n\nIt was also early enough in the day that we completely missed the most of the dinner/drinks after work crowd, so the atmosphere held up. We practically had the place to ourselves for a while. All in all it was the perfect place to stumble into.",

Delivery person was friendly as well and seemed to be used to coming to the hotel for such requests as he called to verify that my room was near the pool.\n\nAll of the food was really tasty and very fresh. when I placed my order the guy said it would be 45 mins. I almost said \"forget it\" but went ahead anyway. Glad I did since my order arrived in about 20 mins instead. It was piping hot! My only suggestions is be sure to ask for cutlery and napkins. I had to go to the front desk to get these things since they did not include them. Guess I was supposed to eat with my hands.\n\nStill and yet, the food was really tasty. The 8 buffalo wings were cooked perfect and the sauce was just enough. The zucchini sticks were plenty; at least 12 of them and really fresh too. The salad was packed in the box filled with yummy greens, red onions, tomato, mozzerella cheese pieces, and basil. I asked for balsamic dressing and it was a great flavor together.",

(of course, no bread either since i'm gluten free.) the burger was great - perfectly cooked and seasoned... though, i felt like a bit of a freak sitting at the bar eating my burger with a knife and a fork. i'd like to come back to try a fancypants burger since the extras look pretty tasty.  the salad was so-so; it was no frills with the perfect amount of dressing. the bartender-cum-waiter was super attentive but not cloyingly so. he made delicious sazeracs to accompany my repast.",

    "text": "This is a great late brunch option during the weekends when the big morning rush dies down after 1 pm. Usually there is no wait or 5 minute wait at this time. One big complaint is that they don't have an organized system for seating guests. The servers don't always greet incoming patrons (which should be required Waffle House-style) and they sometimes tell you to seat yourself (which can lead to one or two people taking up tables for 4) or they'll seat you (whenever they get around to talking to you). \n\nI've ordered a several different dishes at this point and they have varies from ok to awesome. The chicken wings and onion rings are just ok. The wings are either lightly dredged in flour or not at and then fried whole. They aren't really seasoned so the wings are pretty bland. The \"onion rings\" made of formed, chopped onions that are breaded. The chicken fingers were a bit over battered and dry. The smashwich (or whatever it's called) was pretty good: your choice of breakfast meat with hash browns and eggs in a hoagie roll, but unspectacular. The club sandwich is classic diner fare that is very well executed. The egg and omelette platters are a very good deal and dang tasty. The best thing on the menu is definitely the waffle. It's gently sweet, very crispy and covered in butter. So good!\n\nThe service is generally pretty attentive (once you're seated), the restaurant and bathrooms are very clean, the food is a good, tasty value",

The salad was very fresh, with nice greens and homemade dressing. The potatoes, not quite as crisp as ordinary potato chips, were quite good. The meatballs were well above average, nicely seasoned and with generous but not overwhelming cheese. The chicken Parm looked rather flat, and my Dad did not finish it, proclaiming it \"not for me.\" We finished up with Spumoni, very prettily presented with slivered almonds and a light drizzle of strawberry sauce.

I would definitely say their fried chicken is the best I've had before, and fresh! Bottomless coffee too, for $1.75 which I think is quite reasonable. Nice pie, too :)",

Looking for a nice lunch in Reno, I went to Yelp and punched in some key words to avoid the usual fast food chain joints and up popped Sabrina's.\n\nOk good reviews, interesting pics and menu items.  Off we go.\n\nThe location is downtown but not smack dab in the casino zone, nice decor, trendy.\n\nThe menu offers some nice salads and soups.  We both had the bean soup (I highly recommend) and salads; Asian Noodle and South West.  Both salads were well presented, ample in portion, fresh and flavorful.\n\nWe took the recommendation of our server and had the house made ginger ale.\n\nAll in all a very pleasant, delicious lunch.  Prepared by nice people, in a trendy setting.",

Their quesadillas and wraps are all very good, I've had at least half of the items on the menu and they've ranged from, at worst, just ok, to phenomenal.  The quesadillas are very big and are full of some pretty unique combinations.  The wraps are also huge, I usually only eat half a wrap and save the other half for the next day.  While they're all pretty good, I recommend going outside the box and getting the 'Montreal' or 'New Orleans'.  And their 'French Dip' quesadilla is also very good, but for some reason is not listed on their menu.  Check that one out if you like french dip sammies.  \n\nBest part about this place: THEY DELIVER.",

We had a side of brussel sprouts which were cold (purposefully) but delicious.\n\nThen, since we had a long ride home we gobbled up some other goodies.  White cherries (in season, but tough to find), cupcakes, some random candies and such.  Everything I had was delicious.  We grabbed a half dozen apple cider donuts which usually you only find around pumpkin patches in the fall.  They didn't even make the car ride home - gone!  \n\nIf you only come here for one reason, come for the donuts!  Gorgeous. \n\nOverall, the place was adorable with deli-like counters for baked goods and country-style eats  made to order but had some grab n go stuff too.  Quaint little cafe tables inside and out to sit in a barn/warehouse-like atmosphere.  I liked the rocking chairs on the porch - nice touch!  \n\nIf I am kayaking again on the Brandywine, I'll surely be visiting again.",

I requested the hottest they got and it rates about a regular hot at Prince's. Not entirely a deal breaker for me, as the flavor is actually really good.  In terms of flavor, I like Pepperfire, for heat, 400 degrees and Prince's (and very surprisingly Wingbasket). I have yet to try Bolton's but I plan to very soon. \n\nThe guys at Hot Stuff also have hot ribs which seems really interesting, and I'll review again when I get around to trying it. They also have hot chicken salad, so if you're into plants and all that, there it is.  The menu is a lil diverse, so unlike the original hot chicken joints, this place has fish and ribs too.\n\nAll in all, it's good when you're on the south side and want some hot chicken.  It's not the hottest chicken, but it's still good.  Ordering is best called in.",

How YUMMY. I had the cranberry and coconut one. They're very dense so get one BEFORE your meal bc I could only take one bite out of mine after I finished my grilled cheese. Oh man, that grilled cheese. They have a really unique blend of cheeses and pesto! Now I am not a pesto fan (I know, very strange) but it works great here! But the selling point is the tomato basil soup. Literally the BEST I have ever had and this is my favorite soup so I have tried it everywhere. The second time, I tried the classic breakfast: 2 eggs, any style (I opted for scrambled), country hash (delicious) and toast. This time I had my doughssant beforehand, s'mores flavored -- amazeballs. \n\nThe space is very comfortable and beautifully decorated. The staff is extremely friendly always checking in with you and making light-hearted and sincere conversation. \n\nThere is a wait to be seated. But you just have to stick it out because you don't want to miss out on this new restaurant. \n\nI'll be back when they get their liquor license business straightened out so I can sip on a mimosa while I enjoy my grilled cheese.",

We came here on a Thursday night at 8pm without reservations and they were nice enough to seat us quickly. Service overall is very good and the servers seem to enjoy working here which really shows in their performance.\n\nSome of their entrees are a little over priced for their type, but you get enough food for two entrees. I would recommend dropping the size of the larger entrees (14oz pork chop is just too much) by 30% and take $7 off the price. This would be much easier to swallow.",

The food was so good (had the shrimp n grits) that we had to come back for more!\n\nThe prices were reasonable for what you get.  The quality of food were good with service to match.  \n\nI loved their shrimp and grits, but this time I had to try their Seafood Benedict (Seafood cakes made of crawfish and crab mixture).  It comes with a choice of hash brown (has a slight little kick) or grits.  My friends had the traditional breakfast of eggs Benedict and vegetable omelette. The coffee was good,  and so was the mocha coffee ( piled high whipped cream with drizzled chocolate on top). \n\nOverall, our second dining experience was great.\n\nThis is a little hidden \"Foodie Find\" and gem of a place.

So I convinced my husband to do so. Here's how this 2nd chance went:: Absolutely wonderful. Chris asked that we let him know when we wanted to give the restaurant a second chance, but we decided not to. We didn't want any special attention. We wanted real unreviewed service.  We were seated in the bar because it was a very  busy night, regardless of that the server was very attentive and had a great personality. Our food came out in a timely manner, well prepared and delicious. We have since then been back several times and service continues to remain great.",

In fact, I felt a little rushed.  All the locals were running in, saying hi to the owner and ordering up their usual's.  No place for a rookie, but they were extremely patient with us and a few others that wandered in not knowing what they were doing either.\n\nAs soon as you cross the threshold, you know you have made a good choice, the smell makes your mouth water.  The Punk agreed so we decided to sit inside (everyone else was outside).\n\nTypically, I would never ever order pastrami, but the menu said it was lean, so I tried something different for me.  Lean indeed.  Best pastrami I have had in a very long time.  In fact, maybe ever.  \n\nThe punk was amazed at all the bottle caps glued to every surface in the place.  It is a visual feast to keep you busy and entertained while you eat, if you choose to eat inside.  You cannot see the walls for all the nostalgic fodder.\n\nShe was especially thrilled when they brought out her sandwich.

I have really enjoyed the shrimp n grits with its rich buttered and creamed grits and luscious (yes, luscious describes food), spicy shrimp.

I'll have to say the reason I stopped going wasn't the food, but the fact that the last two times we went, the restaurant was full of flies, we even changed tables, but the flies where pretty much everywhere.  I understand they have a beautiful outside sitting area, and people are in and out, but when you are serving food, you need to take care of that.  I also went to another place in NM, same issue, and the owner wasn't too concerned about this, big mistake.  People don't want flies flying into their plates when you sit down to eat.  I hope to go again, but if they haven't addressed this, I won't go back again.  With all that said, other than the two times we encountered this, the food is great.",

Good predictable Thai meal.\n\nBecause I learned they allow BYOB, I brought over some beers from the Giant in the same shopping strip.\n\nI ordered the vegetable spring rolls and shrimp pad thai.\n\nThe spring rolls come out hot out of the fryer. They are sliced at an angle, which allows more of the aroma of the filling to waft up to one's nose.\n\nThe crust was pleasantly golden, both slightly oily and crisp. The interior of the roll was slightly mushy (not quite perfect.) But the mix of vegetables was savoury and generous in portion.\n\nThe accompanying sweet and sour dipping sauce added a needed element of acid to an otherwise very umami forward flavor profile.\n\nThe Shrimp Pad Thai was portioned very generously. The noodles were well executed, firm yet soft on the bite. The dish had a powerful flavor blend of fishiness, savouriness, and sweet. The nuts inside were just crunchy enough to add an interesting mouthfeel. \n\nThe shrimp was slightly over cooked and presented a noticeable but subtle mushiness. \n\nOverall the dish was filling and more interesting in flavor than in texture, which was quite homogeneous. The noodles really did an excellent job absorbing the pad thai sauce.",

Sure, the decor is straight outta 1959, and I could be in someone's living room.  The food here is straight up, no frills, no pretentious airs.   Do wish the wine list had a bit room options, but not a deal breaker.\n\nHad a pre-dinner salad, really liked the Italian dressing, lots of tang from vinegar.  Lasagna for dinner, which turned into two very good sized servings.  The tomato sauce here is great, not sweet, doesn't taste like it's from a can.  Again, reminds me of the old school places from growing up around a bunch of Italians.  \n\nSave room for one of the best versions of spumoni ice cream I've ever had.  That's a tall order, as previously mentioned, I grew up around a bunch of Italians.  It's a bit spendy (about $5), but it hit the spot.  It was split between three people, and we should have ordered two since we put the hurt on the slice quickly.\n\nOnly downside, was the waiter seemed rushed, so much so that he barely any of us a chance to speak before answering for us and then someone having to correct him.  Otherwise, I'm coming back, like I have been for years.",

We tried the sliders, fish tacos, fries and mac&cheese, all of which were pretty good. There was a lovely duo playing during our dinner and it was nice that we were able to enjoy the music and still have a conversation. \nA few tips if you have never been here before:\n- Make sure you have a reservation or be subject to dine/stand at the bar.\n- Even with a reservation, you are instructed to complete your dining within 90 minutes of being seated. Understandable. \n- Try everything!",

I wanted to try everything but had to control myself so I went for a tostada and and three tacos. \n\nThe service is super fast. As soon as we sat down, we were already given our waters and within 5 minutes, our food followed. Both dishes came out extremely fresh and hot. The tostada's ingredients were layered together to create a perfect bite. The beans, cheese, and vegetables complimented each other so well with the crispy base. The tacos weren't as impressive but they were still yummy. I wasn't a big fan of the corn tortillas because it was kind of bland and chewy. The carne asada meat was flavorful but the lengua (beef tongue) had an iron/gamey taste unlike most other Mexican places. The sauces that are given on the table were really flavorful, the red sauce had a smokey peppery taste while the green one (extremely hot) had a citrus/jalape\u00f1o like mixture. \n\nThe restaurant is very clean, has plenty of seating, and I definitely will be back to try the other menu items!",

My #1 favorite is the chicken and noodles - and for those who won't eat the entire (quite generous) portion - you might not know that they offer a small portion for the main course. My most recent trip I got fried shrimp (which were delicious) and a pumpkin roll that melts in your mouth. My only issue with the place is that it is SO dark and dreary in there. I recently heard they'd done a renovation and the only thing I could see that had been done was that there was a new \"country store\" that  was added to the middle of the dining area. Meh.",

This place wasn't really near any downtown things, but we rented a car so it was no big deal to get there. (If you're flying in for a weekend, I really recommend renting a car- I have no idea how we would have gotten around otherwise.) \n\nParking was outrageously expensive so we parked in some shopping center across the street and walked in. It was maybe a 10 minute walk, but you're mostly walking through nicely manicured Opryland foliage so it's a nice walk.\n\nThe hotel was a sight to behold- HUGE glass ceilings, indoor river, many, many restaurants inside which had an \"outdoor\" feel because of the massive atrium. We took a boat ride given by \"Delta River Boat Tours\" which was a cute little boat on a track in their indoor river with a sweet southern tour guide letting us in on all the \"fascinating\" facts about the hotel. She told everything as if it was the most amazing fact that had ever left her lips: \"Here we have the original interior wall of the hotel... it was built in NINETEEN SEVENTY SEVEN!\" (So old!) or, our favorite, \"Here in the hotel we have an INDOOR SWIMMING POOL, so that you can swim ALL YEAR ROUND\" (You mean, INSIDE the building? Impossible!) \n\nAnyway, it was hilarious. Seems like a nice place just to see/have a drink/ maybe dinner if prices aren't insane. Extra star for our tour guide who we still laugh about.",

Bottom line is Chinese people go where the food is good, so hopefully this place will continue to serve good food to keep us coming.  Szechuan food is spicy, so beware.  Each time we go, we order the Happy Fish in Spicy Soup.  The soft shell crab is another one we've tried.  The tea duck is great.

The service has always been friendly and courteous.  I do feel that the size of the wings has decreased lately. \n  We like to arrive and eat early, because although I like the idea of family restaurants , it does get very loud , due to lack of acoustics , and pretty hectic once the families start to arrive for dinner hour. \n  That being said we always enjoy our meal at Peggs.",

Bottleworks would be a 3.5 in my book, but I am going to round up, mainly in tribute to my husband's love of this place as well as appropriate weight given to the excellent beer.\n\nI have a love hate relationship with this place.  Love is the beer, which is  stellar as expected for Schlafly and hanging out in the bar with a live band is definitely a good time (though I could do without the smoke).  The festivals are also outstanding (Prohibition!).\n\nThe major problem I have with Bottleworks is the inconsistency of the food.  Some days, it's solid and satisfying;  I love the multigrain (including quinoa)  pilaf they have available as a side.  Other days you end up with burnt dried out beer bread and poorly seasoned food.  I never know what day it's going to be, so I am wary.  I have never understood this since I have never had a bad meal at the Tap Room which I assume is run by the same group.    It seems the bad days are lessening but they still sneak in there.  This having been said, I still come here pretty regularly given my husband is a huge fan, and I always love the beer.

The food was good, staff was great, and the challenge left me with a stomach ache for 3-days. \n\nI did not get a chance to sample their beer selections but from what my friends said, it's good. I would not recommend the burger challenge if you're going to drink beer. Otherwise for $24, it's by far the best deal on the menu; especially if you split with friends!

My brother and sister have stayed here for an event, and they really enjoyed it, except for the high price tag. The convention center area itself is huge, with gorgeous carpeting, interior decor, etc. all around. There are frequently events and meetings at the convention center, so it's always pretty busy. However, what I really love is the garden area in the center of Opryland. As many of the other reviewers have pointed out, the entire area is enclosed, but it really feels like you are outside walking around in an outdoor garden that is always kept at a nice breezy 75 degrees or so. This in itself just amazes me. There are winding paths (nothing super strenuous), waterfalls, and beautiful greenery and flowers everywhere. There are quite a few shops and restaurants all around the hotel, but the pricing is pretty expensive (I will give a shoutout to Stax though -- a delicious make-your-own burger place). Tip: Park in the back near the Opry Mills Mall and take a short (5 min) walk to a side/back entrance of Opryland. You will save $20+ from not parking in the front.",

They put extra sauce on the pizza and even gave me an extra container of sauce in case I needed more. \n\nI can't decide which was better, the pizza or \"breadsticks.\"  I say \"breadsticks\" because they were really more like garlic bread strips.

I remembered seeing Tsunami when  I was at the nearby Home Depot and the place looked appealing.  I checked the reviews on Yelp and decided to give it a try.  For a Holiday weekend it was crowded, but it didn't take too long to get seated at a Hibachi table.  I have been a huge Benihana fan in the past and enjoy this style of restaurant.  I noticed there were a lot of drinks specials on the menu and the pricing seemed very reasonable compared to Benihana.  There was one guest at the table who had a lot of questions and special requests which took some time to get sorted out, but once she was accommodated, the service moved more quickly.  Not the servers fault.  The portions were huge!  I also didn't expect to get noodles in addition to rice, but it made for some quality left overs the next day.  I ordered the shrimp, scallop and filet teppanyaki and like I stated prior the portions were generous, the fried rice was ok, just rice and egg, no veggies or proteins mixed in - pretty basic, but it was well seasoned.  I was impressed with the scallops and the shrimp and quality of the filet.  All was cooked properly, and the chef was entertaining and efficient.  While the reviews for Tsunami were mixed on Yelp, I would not hesitate to come back and bring friends.  It was an enjoyable experience and a good value.",

    "text": "Another Nashville-area secret--just south of the city in Grassland. Oh my! Have had lunch here several times. Always great food served with courtesy. Stopped this morning for the Sunday Brunch. Oh my! Sweet, savory, succulent, satisfying and a bargain to boot! Too many dishes to mention, so let me highlight just a few: Eggs Benedict served on split Croissant instead of English Muffin - so flavorful, rich & creamy, eggs done perfectly. Jalape\u00f1o Grits - not hot - just piquant enough and so very, very sweet and buttery...mmm. Broccoli salad (and other salads) plus grilled veggies - just right. Steamed shrimp cooked just right. Coconut-crusted Goat cheese medallions - decadently melt in your mouth. Roast beef with wild-mushroom gravy...the beef was tender and bright, pink rare--beautiful. (The mushroom gravy just so-so.) Baked ham. Desserts that I didn't have room to try. And, did I mention...made-to-order omelets and waffles. The list goes on. Oh my. Oh my!",

We had Chris as our server and he took the time to explain in detail any of the beers we were looking at as well as suggest some he thought we might enjoy.\n\nI had the Saison and Raspberry Wheat both of which were awesome if you like a little fruit to your beer.

Half price beer during a generous happy hour, a huge deck that welcomes dogs, and delicious key lime pie.   Sadly, said deck allows smoking, and there is usually lots of it. I wish they at least had a nonsmoking side. \n\nIf giving a review just based on the food, I would give it a two. The pretzels are ok, but the cheese dip is Velveeta nastiest. As a native Wisconsinite, I take offense at plastic cheese. Then, there's the pretzel bun sandwiches. I've sampled the chicken, brat and Italian sausage. It's pricey, considering it comes with potato chips (seriously guys?! Get a fryer!) and just ok. The buns were kind of soggy and the overall experience underwhelming, especially knowing the epic sandwiches for sale next door. I wish the Village pub would focus on what it's best that, serving beer, and let us bring Mitchell's sandwiches over.",

Each came with two sides; I got the collard greens and smashed sweet potatoes with the pulled pork and my boyfriend got the fried chicken with green beans and smashed sweet potatoes. The pulled pork, fried chicken, sweet potatoes were great. I can live without the other two sides. Each plate was $9.99 which is not bad for lunch in downtown Franklin. Be warned, it's not a good place for big groups because it's pretty small and the wait for 6 was about 45 mins around 12:45pm. If I had to wait, I wouldn't have.",

This one was my favorite of the two we tried.\n\nPistachio Herbed Ricotta with Lavender Honey Bruschetta - this was my husbands favorite bruschetta - it was also very good!\n\nRoasted Beet Salad - loved it. There was A LOT of goat cheese, so if you don't care for it as much, then ask for them to go light on it. I love goat cheese myself, so it worked out well. It was light, but there was enough to make lunch filling.\n\nClaudio Mozzarella Sandwich - 4/5 stars - really tasty. He thinks it would have been better if the prosciutto weren't crispy since he felt it lost some of its flavor. \n\nFlourless Chocolate Torta - a good end to the meal. Not TOO much - just enough for two people! \n\nThis was probably our favorite meal we had in Philadelphia and would definitely recommend!",

I love how in locals places staff is usually honest and laid back. The bartender/waiter extraordinaire told me he thinks mules are a joke of a cocktail and so I steered away from the Pear-a-mule and went with the good old margarita.  Cocktail-wise you really can't go wrong. We started with the chips and guac which was delicious, fresh and flavorful. We also ordered the sweet potato wedges with serrano aioli----highly recommended. I had the chimichurri sliders (they caught my eye for some reason). I seemed like and off combination but the flavors worked together and I was quite happy with my choice. (Side note: ladies, you won't be able to eat this gracefully---date tip.) Overall I'm super impressed with the service and quite happy with the food and value. It wasn't crowded when we were there but I can imagine it feels---and gets-- crowded very easily. That's just about the only downside.

Current beer selections include a wheat, stout, IPA, and seasonal IPA.  And the beers are slightly stronger, ranging from 6.0 to 7.3% ABV.\n\nThe ambiance of the taproom is very nice, with wooden interior and large garage doors to give it an airy feel.  There is also a good view on the inside of the fermenters in which the beers are brewed.  One other note on the taproom are the artwork.  The artwork are some of the same as the ones shown on First Fridays.  Think the aim is to use the space to display works from local artists.\n\nI only tried the stout during my visit during Grand Opening, and it had a good flavor w/ coffee undertones.  Hope to make it back to try out the other brews, as well as finding out about new styles that might be coming out.",

    "text": "Fantastic breakfast spot.  I went on two occasions and varying degrees of service both times, but both times, the food was excellent.  The first time, the line was 10 deep, and growing mostly because the counter girl was slower than molasses to enter in a order.  It might have been because she kept screwing it up:\n\nMy rib eye steak and eggs some how turned into ham steak and eggs.... the hashbrowns are excellent here but when we went back on Sunday, they weren't serving hash browns, only grits.... I opted for biscuits and eggs which were fantastic as well...  Great breakfast to grease you up after a night of drinking or you just want a well grilled meal. \n\nBest practice, walk in to the back counter, order your meal and then grab a seat - no wait staff.  They offer up great bloody mary's for those in need a little hair of the dog.\n\nI say some of the talent that walked in and out of here were better than the bar scene and much funner to talk to.  Unfortunately the busers take advantage of this also and the tables suffer with plenty of dirty dishes waiting to be taken care of... even when still when your food comes out... Go and enjoy.",

We were quoted an hour wait, but were able to grab a high top in the bar area with no wait (they are full service).\n\nSpasso is Italian, but has its own little spin; it's not just the classic dishes of a typical Italian restaurant.\n\nThey start you off with bread and this delicious eggplant/pepper topping that is so refreshing. I typically love oil for bread, but love this alternative.\n\nI started with a Caesar salad which was perfect; just enough dressing, super fresh and I love the shaved Parmesan on top. For dinner I had pappardelle porcini which I think is the best item on the menu, it is thick pasta with sundried tomatoes, mushrooms and chicken with light sauce. It is totally delicious, and I had leftovers to have for lunch the next day.\n\nSpasso is definitely recommended for a great dinner in Media!",

    "text": "Decided to try this place out instead of my usual Philly staple on Arch Street: Cali Pho. I ordered way more than I could eat because I really wanted to try something new.  Frog is on the menu by the way, but I chose two fantastic appetizers: Baby Oyster Omelet and Squid with watercress.  Fantastically delicious and the serving was big enough to be a meal.  The problem for me came with my entree: Java Mee, a soup with shrimp, shrimp cakes and noodles.  It was so thick with sauce it was more like a stew and then the tomato sauce (it was mostly red) was so over-whelming I really couldn't decipher the taste of the soup or it's ingredients.  A real shame, and a real let down after the great appetizers.  I would still recommend the place, as it was clean, service was good, and food brought out quickly.  Lost a star for the bad soup though.  However, I plan a second visit to try their pancakes which I saw being made and it looked like a fun tasty dish.  A lot of their dishes are definitely visually very appetizing.",

    "text": "... so we're the type of people who will drive far out for cuz some chef moved out West.  We did this for the I *heart* Mr. Sushi guy (Yoshi's) and now we've done it for Kenji, formerly of Sekisui on Grand.... but actually, Izakaya Ren is abooout the same distance, so it's ok.\n\nI have to say it was worth it.  We came on a slow Sunday (they juuuust opened what, 2 weeks ago?) to a strip mall and walked inside to see a pretty small eating establishment... which made us wonder about their customer turnover rate.  We just ordered all over, from the skewers, a chop chae salad (Kenji and this Korean guy, Wokrae Cho are co-owners?), grilled fish neck, and sushi.\n\nThey were all delicious.\n\nIn particular, I liked the pork belly wrapped asparagus skewer.  It wasn't seasoned, making me think of sam gap sal.  It was gosh darned tasty.  \n\nThe chop chae salad was potato glass noodles with greens and a spicy chili oil vinaigrette thing that was pretty good.  \n\nThe sushi.  This is what we really came for.  The fish was about room temperature and was just melt-in-your mouth quality.  You know how hard it is to find a place that has a decent yellowtail roll with green onion?!  It's absurd.  I really hope they hold their standards to this high a bar.\n\nFinally, the hamachi kama was fresh, moist, and delicious.  It wasn't pre-cured or anything, though.  It was just plain simple fresh fish neck that sat on the grill undisturbed.  \n\nThe only gripe I had was that the skewers were pretty expensive for their size, which averaged a bit over 2 bucks apiece.  I don't know if they have a happy hour, but I will likely steer clear of that part of the menu otherwise.  We found ourselves easily dropping more than 20 bucks a person for this place, but that was simply because we felt the need to try ALL our staples.\n\nAll in all, we will definitely be coming back again.  If you like plain old fashioned Japanese food with a little mix of Korean, this is the place to try.",

    "text": "My wife and I decided to have lunch the other day at Granite City.  We thought the restaurant atmosphere and decorrating was very warm and  relaxing.  The staff was attentive and quite helpful.  We each had one of their regularly featured brews and were pleased with both.  The menu has variety but not so much that you would fear non fresh ingrediants.  Since it was lunch, we went with a sandwich and a burger.  My wife's chicken salad was good but nothing teribbly unusual - which you might expect from chicken salad.  I had the Napa Valley burger.  The menu description made the burger sound very interesting - angus burger with an avacado spread, cheese, mixed field greens in a balsamic dressing with sliced sun-dried tomatos.  The burger was cooked to my liking and was well seasoned - there an number of what would be considered upscale burger places in the Nashville area that don't seem to know how to season ground beef and charge plenty more than Granite City.  My only complaint is that,as it turns out, the balsamic dressing in combination with the sun-dried tomatos over powered the delicate flavor of the avacado.  Additionally, the the chewy texture of the sun-dried tomatos fought with the tenderness of the ground beef.  Next time I will ask them to skip the tomatos.\n\nWe will return to try other menu items.  All in all it was good experience.",

The wine bar area is small but had a very modern atmosphere.\n\nI started off with the Vina Vino wine flight and my friends ordered The Bold and the Beautiful. Both came on a cute wood/chalkboard board with the wine written in chalk. All the wines were very tasty but the Vespucci  Primitivo and the Il Fauno di Arcanum were my favorite.\n\nWe then ordered the fig jam and prosciutto, bleu cheese, arugula flatbread. A little heavy on the blue cheese for my liking but overall was really good. We also ordered the Farmers Platter. You can choose anything from 1-7 items and build your plate from a variety of cheese and meats. We selected the Brillat-Savarin, Cypress Grove \"Purple Haze\", Blue Brie, Spressata and the Italian Speck. The farmers plate also came with jam, mustard,  caramelized nuts and crostini. The Farmers plate by far was my favorite!\n\nOverall I really liked CRU. Its cute, quaint and cozy. Can't wait to come back!!",

    "text": "Tried Olly Fresco's for the first time today. It's located on 107 Street, in the Alberta Health Services Seventh Street Plaza, ground floor of the South Tower. It's kind of like Sunterra in that it's mostly self serve, though there is a soup (4 different kinds) and sandwich/panini/breakfast counter at the back. Lots of choices for drinks (water, soda, kombucha, etc), snacks (like individually wrapped cheese, $0.85 a piece) and desserts (cookies, candies). A decent-sized salad bar with a variety of leafy greens (all looking fresh) and lots of toppings (chicken breast, deli meat, other vegetables). The hot food self-serve area also has about 10 choices ($1.89/100g) - several meats (today was roast beef au jus, roast chicken legs with mashed potatoes and gravy on the side, butter chicken, and another Indian dish), a fish (I think it was breaded), perogies (with self serve bacon and sour cream... dangerous), and some veggies (steamed broccoli and cauliflower, roasted potato wedges), and I assume there is always a vegetarian dish - today's was lasagna. I may have forgotten about a few other dishes. Everything is labelled and relatively fresh - I saw them replenishing lots of dishes even before it got down to the very end undesirable bits. \n\nI enjoyed the mishmash I picked up. You use take out styrofoam containers so you can always bring home leftovers. The lasagna was cheesy and flavourful, despite not having any meat in it. The noodles were not as al dente as I would have liked and it was a touch salty, but overall I liked it. The broccoli was perfectly steamed to retain nutrients - still bright green and just a touch of crunch. The roast chicken was really popular - I don't know if it was legs only but I snagged the last piece of thigh in a sea of drumsticks - skin was still kind of crispy and seasoned with some herbs (indistinguishable though). A touch dry but totally edible still. I loved the perogies - they were very generic potato ones, nothing special but not bad (e.g., the right amount of dough and filling, not mushy). I loved being able to choose as much sour cream and bacon bits (real ones!) as I wanted. \n\nThere's quite a bit of seating and a lot of people seem to get the food to go, so I didn't have any trouble finding a spot for two around 12:15pm (it was busy though!). After grabbing a bottle of premium water, my total came to about $13, and I was certainly quite full. You can spend as much or as little as you want to. I thought the food was decent despite it being made for the masses, and I love the variety of choices - I understand that they change offerings daily so I'd be interested to try other options. I think it's a really great option for the people who work on this west end of downtown (note it's closed on weekends). I will be back!",

It tasted natural, not too sweet with actual fruit preserves in it!\n\nThe luau french toast , made on hawaiian bread was pretty good too.\n\nThe only downside is that the wait for the food itself is a bit longer ,but nothing unreasonable. I think it took about 15 to 20 minutes for the food to come out. As long as you have some time to spare , I would recommend giving this place a try. Ingredients are healthy and fresh. \n\nThere is parking right across from the restaurant.",

Not sure how I've never been there, but armed with a bottle of white, stopped in for a Thursday night dinner.  We shared the octopus and calamari and appetizer which wasn't the best I've ever had, but it was cooked properly.  Bread with olive oil and ricotta was nice, but would be better if they warmed the bread.  I had the eggplant appetizer with a side of fettuccine for my entree.  It was really good, although their tomato sauce is a little on the salty side for my taste.  The eggplant was cooked really nicely though, and I ate the whole thing.  \n\nService was great.  Our waitress was very attentive and everyone there was very friendly.  They must have a large room upstairs because there was a birthday party for 30 people up there.  The main dining area is tiny.",

Some items like soup are given to you immediately and others you reserve a numbered wood block do and they bring it to you. 4 stars might be slightly high for this location. \n\nThe soups are good: tomato basil, mushroom, French onion, potato and usually a seasonal vegetable offering. You can get a cup, bowl or now they have a large. Soup and their complimentary bread (with butter and exceptional blackberry jam) makes for a great modestly priced lunch. Their sandwiches and salads are good and made to order. The seasoned chicken is moist and flavorful and available on several different salads and sandwiches. They have a hot plate with already cooked French decadent items like croque monsieur, potato galette and quiches. These are sometimes good and sometimes a little dried out from being on the hot plate. I recommend the fresh made sandwiches instead as a better bet. \n\nThere is also a small bakery section with some tempting bread and sweets options. The coconut cake is really good as are the tarts. \n\nBreakfast options are good too such as a croissant sandwich amply filled with ham, egg, cheese and tomato. Really good and rather large. Coffee drinks are well done here as well. \n\nThey have some dinner/entree options that are good. The salmon with green beans and a modest dill sauce is simple and lovely.",

Tasty, tasty, with no BP aftertaste.\n\nCons:\n\nThe shucker removed perhaps 4 out of 12 of the oysters from their shell. Not the seamless experience I wanted, and it stopped me from ordering an additional dozen. I was also surprised there wasn't a different type of dipping sauce, like a mignonette offered. I'm happy to make my own cocktail sauce, but I was surprised...\nThe gumbo? For me, it was odd - all roux, with not much seafood, chicken or sausage. And, rice seemed like a practice batch of risotto was used - it was gummy and crunchy.\n\nI'm ready to go back and get more oysters, but maybe with a different shucker working....",

    "text": "I surprised my girl with dinner at Bailey's Range, and she was excited to go!  Being a burger aficionado, I was happy to indulge my girl's burger passion.  At the same time, we were excited because the Range makes everything from scratch -- and I mean everything, right down to homemade buns and homemade sauces.  If they made their own glassware, plates, and silverware, I think they would have taken the experience to a whole new level!  \n\nWe got there shortly after the Range opened, so seating was not a problem.  Our server took our drink orders.  She had a dark beer, and I had the \"Sweet Sweet Bacon\" -- a milkshake with Maker's Mark, candied bacon, and salted caramel ice cream.  The shake was good -- I think mine might have had a little too much Maker's Mark, knocking the balance of the drink off, but I didn't mind -- it had been a long week up to Thursday...!  We skipped appetizers and went right to mains.  She ordered the American burger, and was more than happy.  Then again, who wouldn't want a fried mac'n cheese patty atop their burger, which was cooked medium rare (appropriately the way she wanted it) on a soft bun (double score for her!).  I ordered the Ahh Jamn!, which was supposed to come with bacon jam, red onions (I had asked for caramelized onions), mushrooms, and cheddar cheese.  When my burger came out, I was ready to kill it, so started enjoying it.  About midway through the experience, it dawned on me -- \"...is this my burger?\"  I didn't really get the taste of bacon jam or mushrooms, though it looked like it might have been on there.  The cheese enveloped my burger, so it was hard to tell whether I had the right burger.  But I pressed on anyway, because I was hungry.  We also ordered a large order of fries, and asked for their house mayo and house cheese sauce.  The fries were great, and the homemade sauces were divine.\n\nOverall, this was a good experience.  In hindsight, I should have said something to our server regarding my burger, but I chose not to.  That was my bad.  That's the only reason why I give Bailey's 4/5 stars rather than 5/5 stars.  That being said, that only means that I'll be back there again to try something different, because Bailey's Range is worth it!",

Ambience a bit blahh but still enjoyable.\n\nNow onto the real reason to come here... the FOOD:\nNaan is soft. Garlic is tasty but I usually like the original best.  Regardless of your entree of choice, you really cannot go wrong. And although it does not appeal to my level of spiciness preferred (I like it HOT HOT HOT), it has great flavor and is great for the average spicey food eater. My recommendations are the Masala or Vindaloo (Chicken, Shrimp, Lamb... option is yours). Room for dessert? Order the Rice Pudding  and Gulab Jaman, mix together and enjoy the creamy sugary treat.",

They have fresh rolls that taste just as good as sit down Thai restaurants. I love that they will add extra jalapenos and usually not charge extra.

A large range of excellent toppings and mix-ins are available.

The pizza however, was awesome. I got the Parma. I made sure they added the arugula AFTER the pizza was cooked. It was so good that even though I'm stuffed I can't wait until I'm hungry again so I can enjoy my leftovers!  They also had a twisted pretzel beer that tasted like a pretzel!!!

It was very hard to decide what to get, cause everything looked great!!  \nThe server was very friendly, prompt, and attentive.  \nThe food tasted fantastic, and was cooked just as we ordered it.\nThe two reasons I didn't give five stars:  \nFirst - The burgers were a little smallish for their price.  If I'm paying $10 for a burger, I want something substantial, and I found the amount of meat a little lacking.\nSecond - While I realize that there are only so many cooks for so many people (cause the place was pretty crowded), it did take like 45 minutes for our burgers to be ready; and, while I understand that these are gourmet burgers with all sorts of special  ingredients... bottom line is I think that the amount of time it takes meat to cook is sort of universal, and burgers should be a little quicker than that.",

Since I was in N.O., I wanted to eat seafood and other traditional Cajun fare.  As I suspect most people do, I ordered the 3-course meal for $30.  The fried gator tail appetizer was very good, not too much breading.  I also tasted my friend's seafood gumbo, which was also quite good.  For my main course, I had the seafood au gratin, which was extremely rich (and very tasty).  I also tasted a friend's shrimp creole, which was only ok.  The bread pudding desert was excellent (very dense).  My friend ordered the brownie - don't waste your time.

We had the local yogurt and house granola plate, shrimp n grits (an egg accidentally jumped onto the floor and they were so kind to whip up another quickly), oysters all ways. \n\nHowever, and a big however is the take-out experience. We opted to run downstairs from the hotel, cause the menu was bigger than room service. We ordered two soups, two salads, a dessert.....we got two salads, one soup, no utensils. When I called back, the lady seemed a bit skeptical. Really! So we ran back down for the missing items and alas still no utensils, soooo we ran back down again. Bothersome, unapologetic, and ended our eating there.",

    "text": "\"Just because it's vegan, doesn't mean it's healthy\" reported a friend of a friend, and I think he's totally right--in a good way.\n\nOn one of the first chilly days of Fall, I was not in the mood to gnaw on a fibrous salad for lunch. I wanted something warm and indulgent--and just vegan and eco-friendly enough for me to bask in a little first-world smug.  So, I got the crispy chick'n sandwich and sweet potato fries; both of these items really just hit the spot.  If you're looking for a healthier meal there are other items to choose from, and honestly, other places to go in the city. However, if you're looking to fill a Chik-fil-a sandwich sized hole in your soul--this may be for you.\n\nSome notes: Sandwich is very good--bun may be a little much and they may be a tad generous with their ranch dressing, but these things are easily amended.\n\nFries--great--and this was after having to walk it back to my office a half mile away (yes, in the cold). What makes it better are the sauces: siracha aoli (YUM!) and black bean cilantro (yum).\n\nOverall service was really personable and decor was lovely. Yes, it is a little pricey, but most vegan options tend to be..and yes, it relies heavily on faux meats, but keep in mind that sandwich sized hole in your soul.",

It goes up a bit for the more fancy add-ins.\n\nAnd for those of you who can't handle spicy too well like me, don't forget to request it mild because they won't ask you how you like it and it'll come served with a kick like it's supposed to (still yummy though...just order two more glasses of water lol).

The toppings were fresh the cheese was bubbly! The crust was thin and baked to perfection. I wasn't expecting such a huge pizza- definitely big enough to share! And priced at just $14? A steal if you ask me!\n\nFor pastries we chose the Cream Horns; while they were quite pricy, they were certainly delicious. Likely made that day, they were fresh, creamy and flakey!

The burgers full of flavor and the arugula is a fine touch to the chicken and potato gratin meal.  I was not a fan of the cheese used in the potatoes gratin but will definitely be. Ack for the burger. Wine was a little high priced so I didn't get any. The atmosphere is very nice and so was our waitress.",

    "text": "Went here for the first time last weekend. Called ahead to try and make a reservation but they only do those for groups of 6 or more. Being a group of 4 we went ahead and went in and were given a wait time of 1 hour and 30 minutes. We chose to wait at their upstairs bar and have some cocktails while we waited for our friends to arrive and enjoyed some cocktails during our wait. I had the cocktail featuring egg whites, and it was very very tasty (compares well to some similar cocktails I've had at Thunderbird). Once we finally were seated the food was all delicious. The crispy wagon wheels that they started us with were amazing, and reminded me of the flavor of bugles. The skirt steak was recommended and after looking at other yelp reviews we had to have that, so we enjoyed it and the order of scallops. \nThe food and drinks were awesome, and the wait time was a little rough but once we got situated at the bar the time flew by.\n\nFinal note: if you do sit at the upstairs bar next to a door, be forewarned that the door will bump you repeatedly as management and staff access the closet during the night. It becomes more annoying the longer you sit there because it's unavoidable and a terrible design flaw.",

The one thing I don't like is you have to wait on the waitress for your drinks, I'd prefer to be able to get my own refills. They have a large selection of food. They keep the buffet fresh also. During my last visit they were constantly switching out their food and adding freshly cooked food. The only thing they're missing on their buffet is Black Pepper Chicken, maybe they have it on the dinner buffet. I've never been here for dinner so I don't know what changes on the dinner buffet. For lunch though, this is definitely a go to spot if your in the mood for chinese.",

He even gave us a free gift because it was our first time visiting. The food was fantastic! Full of flavor and huge portions. I tried pulled pork, baked beans, and corn pudding. Among the best baked beans I've ever had. My husband thought the pulled chicken had a bit of a bitter taste and his Mac and cheese looked a little bland. He offered to let me try it, but I would have had to share my beans and, despite the love I have for the man, I didn't want to. I deducted one star on behalf of his bitter chicken. Definitely recommend the restaurant, though.",

    "text": "Good burgers. Not the best ever, but pretty good for a restaurant burger. Extra points for the homemade buns (gluten free and vegan options), and creative choices. The fries were good. And the side salad was tasty too.\n\nAll the choices make it kind of hard to choose. I'd like to see them pare down the menu a bit, focus on 5-10 burgers that they can really do well. Some of the choices are so similar too that I don't think it'd be hard to edit  a bit.\n\nEveryone was raving about the soda choice but no Cheerwine? WTF? Maybe Cheerwine really doesn't exist outside of the Carolinas. There was a \"Carolina\" burger on the menu (suspicious that this would really be Carolina style i.e. w/ pulled pork, vinegar sauce, and slaw on the burger, but we'll have to see) but no Cheerwine? That just doesn't seem right.\n\nThe ice cream was also delicious. I got a salted caramel shake with whipped cream and chocolate sauce. Every bit of it was delicious, especially the chocolate sauce. Next time might need to get a sundae just for more of that sauce. \n\nBonus points for the spicy pickles.",

    "text": "I heard quiet a few things about this place from people all around. I noticed that they opened one up by where I live. So I decided to check out,\"Five Guys Burgers and Fries\". Yes I know there is a typo, and no I am NOT the one who posted the business listing.\n{edit}- looks like they fixed the typo, I guess no yummy french feies for me ;)\n\nWhen I got there they had a long line out the door. The thought that kept racing through my head was that the food better be worth the wait. as I inched my way to the counter which took about 25 minutes.I finally got to the cashier. She was very friendly and explanatory about the menu. She gave me suggestions to order. So I picked what I wanted and placed my order.\n\nI ordered the Bacon cheese burger with cajun fries. They give you multiple options of what you want on your burger. The toppings I chose were grilled onions,grilled mushrooms, lettuce, tomato and mayo. The burger was fantastic! I also tried the cajun fries they were good also! Still the thoughts of that meal dance through my head. They sell hot dogs at five guys, so I might keep that as an option.Also for vegetarians out there they do sell grilled cheese sandwiches and a veggie burger. \n\nOne thing that I will note is that the fries are cooked in peanut oil. Also they have free peanuts available for customers. If you have any allergies to peanuts than this place is probably NOT for you. I just thought I would throw in that disclaimer. Another heads up is how busy this place gets. You may have to take your meal to go given the fact that indoor and outdoor seating may be occupied. The prices are pretty reasonable here because you can get a filling meal for under $10. \n\nIt still boggles my mind that this place is fast food, because it is almost as good as most gourmet burger spots. I will admit that for a chain fast food restaurant this place is top shelf. This place is definitely worth checking out.\n\nIn short good food,good prices, and good service. Who could ask for anything more?",

    "text": "Very accommodating!\n\nI say this because I ate here last week, which was not to long ago, for a friend's birthday. There were about 7 of us, total. I called twice to change the reservation time, and they were very polite about it.\n\nWe were worried about not being able to eat here because we found out one of my friends has a peanut allergy. Knowing the way Asian restaurants work, a lot of them use peanut oil or peanut products in their food.\n\nThree people that worked there came up to our table to listen to our orders to make sure that they got it right, and to omit any peanuts in the dishes. I believe one of them might have been the manager. If that isn't good service, I don't know what is!\n\nWe ordered the roti canai (indian pancake), shrimp puff, young chow fried rice, hainanese chicken, sizzling beef, shrimp pad thai, deep fried shrimp with ginger soy sauce.\n\nThe roti is probably their most famous dish. Once you try it you'll know why. As soon as we sat down I asked if we could order an appetizer to start (since everyone was hungry and it was already 8pm). She asked if I wanted roti and how many, before I could even ask what I wanted. How'd she know? Two please!\n\nThe shrimp puff was so delicious! I'm warning you though to let it sit for a bit and give it 5 minutes. It is served HOT and WILL burn your tongue. The sauces tend to squirt out into your mouth as soon as you bite into it, which is no fun when it's extremely hot! Wait it out and you'll thank me later. The sauce was a nice touch to the shrimp puff. Very cohesive appetizer. You should definitely try this one.\n\nFried rice was average, as any Asian restaurant's fried rice is.\n\nHainanese chicken was very different ... never had anything like it. It's completely baked but served at room temperate so it gives off the feeling that it's being served \"cold\". It's actually pretty good with the soy sauce (which is served under the chicken) if you can get over the way it looks and the cold texture. We we're actually served a piece that was still blue and looked like a cyanotic chicken extremity which turned me off completely, even being in the medical field. Shivers. We decided just to set it aside and remove it so we wouldn't have to look at it anymore.\n\nThe sizzling beef was absolutely.. FORGETTABLE. Do not get this dish. It lacked flavor, and did not come out sizzling. Womp, womp.\n\nThe pad thai is also just an average dish. Nothing too special going on, probably would not get it again since I could get better pad thai elsewhere.\n\nNow I saved the best part for last.. the deep fried fish! It normally comes with other sauces, but we requested to do a simple ginger and soy sauce. This is the best fried fish, ever! We all couldn't get our hands off it and fought for the last morsel! Main reason it was so good was because it was so crispy! Good to share due to it's size. Fairly big. I would totally go back for this.\n\nParking could be difficult during the weekend due to it's location, so try an odd weeknight. Like say, a thursday.",

I spent a lot of time working in the Gentilly area/Upper 9th ward and used to stop into Zimmers pretty frequently. It's a charming family owned and operated spot that is usually jam packed during the lunch rush. If you're in a rush, it would definitely behoove you to order ahead so you don't spend your entire lunch break waiting in line. The staff is always very friendly and personable so sometimes, you actually forget how long you were waiting in line. Their marinated crab legs/claws are wonderful but for me, their true standout is the crab cake patty po'boy. I truly feel like it's the best seafood po'boy in town! It's incredibly filling (it has 3-4 crab cake patties) and will only run you about 12 bucks.  \n\nAlthough I only have rave reviews about Zimmers, I am only going to give it 4 stars because of their hours. They are closed Sundays and Mondays and usually close at 6 so if you work a traditional M-F 9-5 you may not really have a chance to experience the magic of Zimmers, as you should.",

I am not much of a mixed drink drinker since I tend to lose my inhibitions when hard liquor is involved.  The two drinks that were recommended to me were a Pim's cup and Sazerac.  I went with the Pim's cup and it was one of the best mixed drinks I have had in a really long time. It was very smooth and very refreshing. The cucumber garnish gave it a nice twist.

    "text": "Why am I just now trying this place? (Answer: because I typically wait til I'm hangry and opt to frequent someplace known to quickly satiate my hunger.) The cocktails really impressed me. I had a fancy margarita. Sounds simple and dumb- nope, delicious and different. (I can't think of the name; you would've been more impressed.) While there weren't any vegetarian options listed the waitress let me know they could make almost anything meatless. Score! I truly enjoyed my dinner of corn cakes & veggies annnnd the guacamole we had as an app. The tres leches cake was fantastic as well. Ambiance was nice & I'd totally recommend this to someone looking for a date night location. We'll absolutely return. Edit: we tried their brunch! Like some folks have mentioned, it's not super busy. Totally a win because I hate waiting forever and a day when I'm most likely famished and hung over. My sister and I split the breakfast tacos & the veggie omelet. The tacos were amazing! I wish they offered these a la carte. (I'd just have four of them plus a cocktail.) Each dish came with breakfast potatoes. I love potatoes. Looooove. While the seasoning was really delicious, they weren't all the way cooked through and had that raw taste still. Bummer. They gave us a flan as apology and it was killer. (I still would've rather had cooked potatoes but seriously classy save, Delicia.) I'll return. Next time I'll skip the omelet and potatoes for tacos and fruit if they'll sub it. A solid place to recover on Sunday early afternoons though.",

The space is warm, with a decent scattering of tables and benches in a cozy space (right on the edge of cramped but not quite there). I got a hot chocolate with almond milk, which was on point -- very chocolate forward without being too sweet. My friend got their classic drip coffee (a dark roast) with milk and was pleased with the quality. We couldn't resist a bit of something sweet, so split a canele -- a cylinder-shaped French pastry with a deeply caramelized exterior and a surprisingly light and lemony interior. It was my first and it was a worthy indulgence.\n\nThere is no posted menu, so the ordering can be a little confusing. But the baristas are knowledgeable and even gave me tastes of their different drip options to help me decide.\n\nI've also seen this place quite crowded with laptop squatters as well as people meeting with friends -- probably because it's right off of Rittenhouse Square -- so we lucked out in finding a spot.",

    "text": "Not mediocre at all IMHO.  Makes me wonder if Daniel O. went to the same place we did.\n\nThis is a great neighborhood byob place that provides welcoming service and excellent food at a reasonable price.  We started going here because numerous South Philly friends recommended it.  This is not foo-foo Italian.  This is not pretentious Italian.  This is \"let's go back and work our way through the menu\" Italian.  We found the specials to be good choices.  My husband's broccoli rabe and sausage was excellent, as was a grilled romaine salad with bleu cheese and pine nuts.  Both were generous enough to share.  Last time, sausage & figs was a hit.  If you are in the mood for a basic plate of macaronis with red gravy, you won't be disappointed either.  We had a great time with the waitress because my BIL brought a bottle of Great Wall wine from China (that was the 2nd bottle we opened) and that started a whole crazy discussion.  She didn't know us from Adam, but we left there feeling like regulars.\n\nIt's a very doable destination if you are on your way to a sporting event at the Linc or the Cit, or to the Spectrum or Wachovia Center.  For those who rely on public transportation, you can get off the subway at Broad & Oregon, then walk back a block to Broad & Porter.  Make a reservation, though because it can be a popular place.  You also want to make sure you have time to have a relaxing meal and make your event in time.",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I decided to stop by for lunch yesterday, and I am so glad we did. I ordered a side of beans, chips and salsa, and guacamole. He ordered two steak tacos and a side of rice. The beans are hands down my favorite I've had from a mexican restaurant.  My only complaint is that, unfortunately you do not get a very big portion. The salsa is so fresh tasting and delicious-very cilantro forward, and the chips were nice, thick and crunchy without being oily at all. Take note though, chips and salsa are not included with your purchase and must be bought separately. Now let me get to the best part-the made to order, chunky guacamole. The hardy chips would definitely withstand this heavy duty guac, but I opted instead for tortillas as my vessel to stuff it with along with my beans and salsa. The hot sauces were anything but, though admittedly my tolerance to spices may be higher than the average persons. While I had a great eating experience, my boyfriend did not. He said the meat was of low quality and quite flavorless. He did say he would give it another shot though!",

We made reservations, but it really wasn't necessary as it was pretty empty... I am not sure it is like this all the time, so be safe and make one. We have been here twice and the dress is \"smart casual\", whatever that is... meaning we saw everything from shorts and tanks to very nice dresses. Take it as you will, and dress at your comfort level. \nThe service: The service was exceptional, if not a little too friendly.. i.e. our waiter literally stood over my husband to see how he liked the turtle soup... He then proceeded to try to list the 27 ingredients. I chalk it  up to he was young and new to the business, and really took to the whole chit-chat with customers bit a little too seriously. Once he got other tables things mellowed out and we really enjoyed ourselves. \nOur daughter ordered off the kids menu, which is a set 3 course meal for $12. It truly was a bargain, and the staff took great care to make sure her order paired our food as far as the timing of things coming out. My husband and I each ordered the three plate deal. Honestly, there was so much food that I could only eat half of what I ordered. My husband, on the other hand, practically cleaned the plates. Everything we had (turtle soup, tuna duo, truffle fries, oysters, crabmeat deviled eggs, beef mole sopes), was delicious! \nI definitely recommend Ralph's",

    "text": "I'm so confused!!!  The pictures of the burger look so amazing how can you not want to just eat your phone BUT the BBQ oysters at Red Fish Grill I know are amazing BUT the BBQ shrimp cooked in spices and herb butter at Deanies are so highly regarded.  SO where would you eat if it was your last lunch of a great NO trip?  Hard to choose, right?  Wrong!!  We went to all three and were not disappointed in the least.  I suggest you do the same.  \nStart at Lukes and split the $16 dollar burger kinda pricey but very tasty.  Then Walk over to Red Fish Grill and eat  two orders of their BBQ Oysters (you'll feel cheated if you get just one order) with an Ice cold beer. Now realistically that should be enough for lunch but its only fish, not too filling? \nNow onto Deanies to sit at the bar and eat these amazing shrimp, however, I'm not sure what was better the shrimp or the loaf of French bread to dip into the butter with and washed down with an ice cold Heferweisen on tap!!! My God was it satisfying. I haven't felt that satisfied since my \"first time\"!!! Screw the calories I'm in Nawleans! Now I think I know what a junkie must go thru when he needs his fix.  You can't just get these flavors anywhere you know. \nAnd if all of the above wasn't enough like too idiots we walked to Caf\u00e9 du Mond for coffee and beignets. \nWe took a cab back to the hotel because we obviously could not walk, had a quickie and took a nap so we could dine at GW FINS which was also a fantastic experience.  Try the Scallabutt (scallops fused with a hunk of Halibut).  Se bon!! and Happy eating!",

    "text": "We eat out alot and had heard extremely good things about Porcini.  A pet peeve of ours is making us wait for table when there are a bunch in the room.  It was odd to have that happen, not a show stopper though.  They take their time throughout the meal (not TOO long, but it's a nice pace to let you talk with friends for an evening out).  Nice atmosphere. The food was very good, you will leave not too stuffed, but just right.  Homemade Ravioli are extremely good.  Worth the trip to try a new restaurant - be sure to bring Yelp's $20 coupon.  ENJOY!",

How many times have you been on the way back into an airport, and not found a gas station nearby? Happens to me to any times - often you have to go out of your way to find one. Not so here!\n\nPaid at the pump - I note that the pump had a hand scrawled note taped to the pumps - requesting you press the appropriate button (credit or debit) before swiping your credit card.

There are a decent number of seats here, but again, if you come in the morning, you might feel a little uncomfortable with the people in line crowding your space. I am a big coffee drinker, so I like that their refills are 75 cents, if I remember correctly. The baristas are also very friendly.\n\nMy major problem with La Columbe is their lack of wifi. It's the 21st century, guys! It's a good place to hang out for a few hours with a friend or do some non-computer-requiring work, but the lack of wifi is seriously limiting.",

    "text": "Moving back to tampa from Baltimore I've been looking for a divey neighborhood bar that I can go to and drink and while \"the indie\" doesn't meet everything I would of hoped its the best bar I've found around.  Large rotating craft beer selection with and even superior bar staff that's friendly, knowledgeable, and locals themselves you'll quickly come to realize why this is my tampa go to bar.  Before moving to Seminole heights I was living in temple Terrace and didn't mind driving here just for a beer because of the atmosphere, the people, and the food.  \n\n-Cool people ranging from hipsters-business professionals: check\n-Beer: check (double check since they offer a great craft selection)\n-atmosphere with a great outdoor patio where the neighborhood meets: check\n-food (which is not your typical low quality bar food) while not a requirement for me has come in handy on the nights I end up spending 3+ hrs here lost in conversation: check\n\n \nOverall it's my favorite bar in tampa.  Alas it's not anything like what I long for, which is a divey bar like Mt Royal Tavern in Baltimore, it certainly has picked up the gauntlet of being my go to everyday bar since I've moved.  Love it or hate it I don't care the staff here will keep making me broker for many moons to come.",

    "text": "Our last minute decision to try Asian Chef was based on reviews we read on Yelp.\nWe went as a family and reserved in advance. Upon our arrival we realized that the space was small but well furnished. This is not a tablecloth type of a restaurant. The staff was friendly and informative about their menu. The staff was able to provide a clear and concise description of what the raw material for each dish was and what the final dish would taste like. Their advice was accurate, beneficial and helpful. All the appetizers were delivered timely and were delicious. The main entrees were the same. The sushi was fresh and was made to our particular request. The portions were generous and well presented on new dishes with interesting designs. Our three issues with the establishment were 1) the establishment was understaffed  (wait staff).  We must reemphasize again the staff was timely and professional 2) hot food was served on cold dishes. 3) The website Asian Chef was small.\n\nWe highly recommend that you to try Asian Chef. Please remember that the Asian Chef is BYOB and thus you should come prepared with several selections to pair with this unique restaurant's menu. The menu choices are plentiful and run the gamut from Sushi to Spicy Vietnamese food.\n\nEnjoy!",

Fresh bread and bruschetta was brought first. Very fresh and tasty. Next up was fried calamari which was good, but not remarkable. Our table had a variety of entrees: pescatore had the largest mussels,. Another had seafood in vodka sauce which was delicious. I had the lasagna. Very dense filling and I liked the spinach layer inside. Not room for dessert, but we did enjoy the complimentary limoncello shots to cap the meal. Wait staff were very attentive but not overbearing.

We are grateful to our server, Colin, for recommending them our first night.   As I'm writing this review, I can still picture the shrimp and even better, I can still taste it.    There are a few dishes I dream about and this is one of them.      We also tried the fried calamari; it was good.    I'm from the north where we like marinara sauce with calamari.   In the south it seems to be served with sweeter soy or  sweet chili based sauces which I'm still getting used to.    Our entrees were very good: po-boy and fish of the day.     It's a nice place ambiance wise in a very good location.      I will give a shout-out to Colin for recommending the Shrimp Ju-Ju.",

It's just so lovely on a nice sunny morning. \n\nCame here on a Saturday with the bf. we ordered a brunch special which came with french toast, scrambled eggs & 2 pieces of bacon. We also ordered the roast beef sandwich. The french toast was delicious! It almost reminded me of the bread pudding. The only problem... it wasn't big enough!!! If I wasn't being conservative I could have eaten that portion of french toast in 2 bites. Not joking. It was good but not sure if it was worth like $7. The roast beef sandwich however was AMAZING! Boar's head never gets old. There was also some kind of chutney in the sandwich which is what made it pretty tasty in my opinion. And the sandwich was only like $6 and came with fruit. \n\nSuch a cute brunch spot. I would absolutely return!",

    "text": "Yeah! Congrats La Mulita! What better day to give this new restaurant a whirl than Cinco de Mayo with $5 salt rimmed margaritas? \n\nFirst off, the margarita was mighty tasty. The second one was equally delicious ;) I'm not typically a marg fan but in the spirit of the day I opted for not one but two. In general, La Mulita's cocktail menu is very wallet-friendly with most drinks falling in the $6 to $7 price range. Also, I appreciated that they had new local breweries like Outliers on the menu.\n\nBefore I move on to the eats, I have to mention how cozy and sexy the space is - from the low lighting to the industrial vibe with wood timber, exposed beams, etc. (see picture) The lighting found that perfect spot between too bright and fluorescent and uber dark (ya know...we're trying super hard to feel like a speakeasy/you can hardly see your date). Nicely done. \n\nEats: \n-My personal favorite was the refreshing Columbian coleslaw - I appreciated that it wasn't heavy and left me feeling less guilty about the half dozen other eats I sampled during our visit.\n\n-Delicious guac - I knew this going in but I would also like to add that the chips were tasty to boot. \n\n-salsa and chips - nothing mind blowing but I would definitely order again\n\n-kale chips - I hate to buy these when out because I can make them pretty well at home but I couldn't resist trying my neighbors - - soooo good! Plus, it's a great healthier bar bite option.\n\n-roasted red cabbage and sundried tomato pesto dip: we probably should have stopped ordering more food before this because by the time it rolled around I needed to unbutton my pants. My dining companions couldn't believe that there wasn't any meat in this app, it somehow pulled off a hearty taste with all veggies. \n\n-lastly, vegetarian chiliquales: on the dry side. Unfortunately, I couldn't taste the pepper. I'm thinking if there were a few more veggies and more \"sauce\" this dish would be top notch. \n\nCan't wait for my next visit!",

I had a flight of all the beers on tap and choose the summer seasonal brew. (It was 110 degrees that day.) Decor is a mix of industrial and southwest...the staff was very friendly. I was there when the college was out so the place was not crowed at all. Which is what I like. I had the black n blue burger with the beer fires. it was pretty decent and it came out very fast which was a plus. I will be back when I am in town again.",

Probaby not.  But, you are going to find your staple foods and supplies.  I love the bulk bins for spices.  Sunday afternoons and monday evenings are the worst time to shop, and can be pretty frustrating.  Also, Monday seems to be when they are the lowest on stock.  Bring your own bags and you get .10 cents back per back. (it all adds up, right?)\n\nPro tip:  Their pizza dough and sauces back by the cheeses is a great cheap way to make your own pizza at home.\n\nPro tip 2: when you're leaving to go to your car, check out the great view of Mt. Rose.  Some of the most picturesque sunsets in Reno I've caught on my way out of winco.",

Inside their is a large and small area with a bar to eat and look past the parking lot to nicer part of Jenkintown town square.  The wait staff is always nice and the owner is often around to talk to.  Free dum dum lolly pops at the counter as you walk out and news papers to read if you are eating alone or want to check in on the Phillies.\nFood- always good. Great pancakes that are fluffy and crispy on the edges.  Kansas City  is a great breakfast too- for the most part great.\nBig salads could have more Stuff in them- more of the things that are supposed to be there- as described etc.  But a complaint is readily heard and they always try to make you happy.  It's Nice- try it.",

Since it was our first night back in New Orleans we didn't want to plan reservations anywhere not knowing what the night may bring. We ended up having dinner here and it was awesome. I personally ordered the red beans and rice which were awesome and the burger, also great. My fianc\u00e9 ordered the meatloaf and It was amazing! I was also able to try the gumbo and it was delicious. Not a location you would expect great food, one guy in the kitchen and one bartender taking care of everyone. I would recommend stopping here while in town. Looking forward to going back to try one of their bloody Mary's everyone keeps raving about on here.",

It's a little known secret that there's an old timey dry goods store just behind the coat rack in the main lobby where one can stock up on provisions or barter pelts with real Mooresville natives. In the winter, children can use the yellow 6x4 foot cafeteria tray to go sledding down hills behind the Kroger across the street. \n\nOh, you're not goin anywhere without pie!

    "text": "I came to Philly for a weekend trip with my bf, and remembered how great Marrakesh was from years ago with my parents.  It's still down a dark alley off of South Street and in a house (the owners' house) Things have slightly changed- Marrakesh is still dim, and served as a 5-course eat-with-your-hands dinner family style, (as if in Morocco)  surrounded by tons of Middle Eastern decor- runs, lamps, the works. The servers are the owners- a couple who loves to keep it traditional. \n\nI called ahead for seating at 8pm but it seems as though we could have just walked in- we ate upstairs.  You have to ring the bell to get in. We came on Sunday but it was relatively busy- downstairs was full but upstairs not so much. Maybe it was because we were upstairs...but I felt service lacked a bit (we had to ask for water a few times, etc but I couldn't hold it against the one server- the wife). On Fri and Sat, there are belly dancers. \n\nIf you're new to this kind of thing, they do a good job explaining the process. First, they ran your hands through soapy water from their majestic-looking teapot. Next, they explain the menu and ask you to choose between 1 or 2 course for dishes 3 and 4. You don't have a lot of flexibility.. so I am not sure how vegetarians would fare. \n\nWe ate:\n\n1) Course 1- three salads: picked carrots, cucumbers and an eggplant puree- like a babaganoush. This was very tender, salty and good- the others were not as fancy but very tasty. A large tangine looking thing comes around for you to grab pita. The pita is ok- it's not warm, it's not fluffy but you can't win them all (and it's important not to fill up too much on this)\n\n2) Course 2- Very interesting kind of Moroccan...quiche? It's basically a flaky pastry topped with confectioner's sugar that houses egg, chicken, nuts...and some other things. It was overwhelmingly eggy, but tasty. Not my favorite dish but had to give it points for creativity and uniqueness.  The flaky dough was delish- very similar to that of the Green Spinach Pie.\n\n3) Course 3- was our choice between two chicken (chicken with lemon olive oil or spicy cumin)- of course we did spicy cumin! It was fall right off the bone- so tender as I'm sure it was slow cooked for hours. It's also half a chicken so you get the breast, thigh and wing. The sauce was not too spicy, I thought, but the cumin flavor is smoky and present. The sauce is pretty slathered across the meat- and yes you can refill up on pita if you're not into eating meat solo. \n\n4) Course 4- is a choice between beef or lamb and since I don't do red meat, I passed on this. My bf ordered the lamb though and said it was very tender and yummy- and sweet. It was topped with almonds and something else that made it sweet. \n\n5) Course 5- Dessert!  You get fresh fruit and baklava (one piece each). Usually I think baklava is too sweet for me but this one was pretty good- and not too oily. I mean, yes, it was very oily but it wasn't like...drenched in oil. It was pretty flat, cripsy and full of that nutty goodness that you make baklava. Bf said it wasn't nutty enough for him. Again, the flaky dough wins. \n\nThe fresh fruit was also a plus- except our apple was bruised so we didn't eat that. We took our orange for breakfast the next day. There were two strawberries (not really regional, ha) and giant seedless grapes that were almost frozen because it the fruit platter came with a chunk of ice. This was almost like a cornucopia..they really do make you feel like emperor and empress haha!\n\nThe meal is well paced (slow) so you have time to breathe.  They sell only a few house wines by the glass; otherwise you get it by the bottle (there are a few varieties at $30 ish, as well as liquor and the like). My bf got two glasses of red wine- the burgandy. It was actually fruity and full of body, which was a plus. I ordered the traditional rose drink which I actually wouldn't recommend- it was really, really sweet. It was like rose syrup (sweet enough), with sugar and water..it was too sweet and at $5, I was upset I couldn't finish it. \n\nThis place accepts cash only and is $25 per person. I feel the menu could get old since you don't have variety but it's definitely a must-try while in Philly.",

Nice, hard-working, mannerly people in a very cool atmosphere that appreciate the business.  Food is consistently fresh(seafood) and good.  Pizza is the best in South Jersey and my husband, the unofficial pizza 'officianado' makes me try them all, from NYC, to Trenton to Philly, Delaware, Chicago.  This is really the best pizza I've ever had. The crust is thin, crispy yet has a nice chew, and flavorful.\n\nLast night I had a dinner special of chicken cutlet in a lobster, white -truffle oil, light cream sauce with asparagus, shallots and sundried tomatoes over angel hair pasta. On the Special's menu it is listed as a veal entree, but the kitchen was more than happy to substitute Chicken for me. The dish was so delicately seasoned with such a fine touch that I enjoyed smelling it almost as much as tasting it. In addition, it was such a generous portion that I enjoyed it two nights later for dinner and now want to go back tomorrow and order it again!!  What an absolutely fabulous recipe. Very fine, subtle flavor but also comforting and satisfying. \n\nNot to mention, Selena the Bar Manger, bartenders Jayna and Chris are just so pleasant, professional and helpful, it really is a great place to go!\n\nEnjoy!!",

Now, OC Haley is making a come back.  Cafe Reconcile is leading the charge.  Delicious Southern cooking, I love the collard greens and fried chicken, and a program to get vulnerable youth off the streets.

You literally walk in and no longer feel like you are in Indiana. Everything is sparkly and glittery, and the smells are divine. \n\nWe made the trek by uber to this neighborhood and really wanted to try this place! We arrived around 11 for an \"early lunch\" slash \"snack\". We ordered the quiche of the day which was quiche Lorraine and the famous Earls Court Chocolate Cake.\n\nThe quiche was quite delicious. The egg was so fluffy and savory while the crust was super flaky and had a great bacon flavor.  This was a perfect snack to split between 2 people and just hit the spot!\n\nIt was so hard to decide which cake to try. One gripe that I have about this place is the price of the cake slices. The slices are quite large and pricey. If you only come with 2 people it is hard to get a few things to share without either breaking the bank or stuffing your face with dessert. I asked if we could do 1/2 slices, but was politely denied. A suggestion I have would be to allow fractions of slices so people can try multiple different cakes.\n\nMy wife loves chocolate and I love all sweets so we opted for the famous chocolate cake. There was so much great chocolate flavor and for the most part, the cake was super moist. It seemed like the edges of the cake might have been a little over cooked/on the dryer side but the flavor was delightful!",

All of the ingredients taste fresh, and their bread rolls are amazing. They are nice and soft, not with that cut the roof of your mouth crust. Being born and raise in Santa Barbara, actually just down the street, I have been coming here for some years now. I've tried probably over half of their sandwiches and all have been good, so good it's hard to pick a favorite.  In addition, I cannot forget to mention their awesome soda selection, so awesome I cannot hesitate to try something different with every visit. You won't find anything super fancy or exotic, like a roasted duck pastrami sandwich here, but if you're a local or just passing through and feel like having a great sandwich with good fresh ingredients swing by Plaza Deli and grab a bite.",

So of course we had to go try it out. \n\nThe only thing I'd complain about is that the wait for the sushi bar is really long. You can't sit at the Teppan Yaki tables if you're only getting sushi and the sushi bar seats only a couple of people. \n\nThe sushi was pretty good, although some rolls could have been made better. They were obviously in a rush since they had so many customers and so the service wasn't that great. But for $19 (not including tax + gratuity) we got 4 rolls and 4 pieces of nigiri. Overall pretty good for my sushi cravings when I'm on a tight budget.",

    "text": "First time back to Nashville since I was in high school, and can't believe I haven't been back sooner! Here at Vanderbilt for a class, and kept passing by the Tavern on my way to campus each morning... Had an inticing, rustic, downtown Manhattan look to it. So I put it on my list of places to check out. I looked here in Yelp, and saw it had great reviews. \n\nI came in for dinner tonight, and immediately noticed the reclaimed wood door, wrought iron, and alternative rock playing. I knew it would be a great place. I sat at the bar, as I was here by myself, and immediately got a menu and was offered a drink. I had the 1920, which was a little stout, but better than weak, am I right? I ordered the lamb tacos, Tennessee tavern fries, and cinnamon roll bread pudding. Tacos were small, but honestly a decent portion considering how much meat was on them. They were hot out of the kitchen, and the roasted peanuts gave it great crunch. Now, the Tennessee tavern fries ... Sweet potato fries with a touch of cinnamon and sugar, with jalape\u00f1o ketchup. Shut the front door, these were to die for. Light and airy, arrived in a mini frying basket with abundant portions. The ketchup was amazing, and I definitely asked for more. The cinnamon roll bread  pudding was a muffin size portion, with vanilla ice cream, homemade whip, and caramel sauce. Great flavor, not overwhelming. \n\nService was fantastic, and even met some fun people! Highly recommend this place. I'll be coming back for sure.",

The energy in the restaurant was great.  The staff was interacting with the customers as if many of them were friends.  Nick, the owner, was eating at one of the tables and would get up and help the staff and check on the customers.  I was pleasantly surprised by the overall cleanliness of the restaurant.  I had the house omelet. The Greek inspiration for this omelet was a pleasant change from the normal omelets served in most breakfast places. Yes, they do call their fries \"Freedom\" fries.  I personally appreciate this and would like to compliment Nick for it.  I would definitely recommend Blueberry Hill to anyone.",

Is it because cheese is expensive in Canada?  As far as pizzas, I have ordered the Margherita, Abruzzo, Vesuvio, Siciliana, and Moo Shu BBQ Duck.  The pizza that I order the most often is the Abruzzo and the pizza that I found the most disappointing was the Moo Shu BBQ Duck.  The time I ordered it, I found the flavor profile of the whole okay, but the execution was poor.  The duck was overly oily and the hoisin sauce overwhelming.  The one time that we ordered the Caprese Salad, the cheese texture was soggy and lacking flavor.  We found that this preparation of the salad was inedible.  The manager came to the table to explain the \"artisan\" cheese and how it is sometimes not created in a consistent quality.  He removed the salad from our bill and kindly offered us a complimentary dessert which we declined. We made sure to give a generous tip to staff since the service was great regardless of the salad.",

Good flavor and great texture. I'll definitely be having those again! Don't bother deciding on your sides until you get up to the counter and can see the board because they do not have everything on the menu every day. The mac and cheese was so good! It wasn't what I expected from a BBQ place! The \"baked beans\" we're also good but they are really mixed beans and not at all like the BBQ baked beans you get at other places. Still good, just not baked. \nThey also had Abita Strawberry and the Blackforest Kolsch. Excellent bar selection!!\nI'm docking them a star because of the system of ordering at the counter and then taking the plastic number to a table. This system works in theory, and in practice at other places, but you HAVE to keep people from \"saving tables\" when they have yet to order. I get it if you have a group of 10 but for normal sized tables, it throws the whole system off! The line was long last night but the food comes out fast so tables turn over quickly. By the time we ordered there were no open tables. There were around 8 tables taken up by people who were still 20 minutes from ordering. That throws the whole system off! Let people who have already ordered eat. Another table will open up for you by the time you order!\nThis can easily be solved by posting a sign and asking the servers to enforce it. \nLuckily there were two spots open at the bar. \nOn a side note, the bartender was awesome: fast, attentive, and knowledgeable. I may just sit there in the first place next time!",

But something that I crave everyday! \n\nThis particular Starbucks is great. The baristas are always friendly and welcoming. The drinks are made correctly and quickly. I usually go with a Salted Caramel Hot Chocolate or Mocha. I also occasionally order the White Mocha. If you can't tell, I enjoy coffee that doesn't taste like coffee! In the summer their iced teas are the perfect thirst quencher! Their breakfast pastry items are always delicious. Try the Cranberry-Orange Scone and you will not be disappointed! Their breakfast sandwiches are unique and pretty tasty as well.\n\nI always choose to go in and place my order over sitting in the drive thru. The line for their drive thru is always ridiculously long. It's usually quicker to go in!",

    "text": "We are from out of town, and I came here on a Friday night with 4 of my colleagues after we all had a sudden craving for hibachi. We found this location on Yelp and based on how busy it was that night when we got there, we figured it was good.\n\nThis is a typical hibachi steakhouse... there's not much difference as the menu is typically the same. The prices were as expected, and I paid $39 for filet, chicken, and lobster. The only thing I can say that's different is the fact that in addition to rice, you get noodles with your hibachi dinner. I thought that was pretty neat but man was I stuffed after finishing everything!\n\nThe steak was super juicy and tender, in fact I'll probably have to give them 10 stars for how well the steak tasted. It wasn't fatty at all and I can tell it was a good cut of the filet. Everything was actually pretty good but the steak was the best.\n\nService was awesome and our chef kept everyone laughing throughout the entire experience. If I'm ever in St. Pete's again, we'll definitely make another visit here!",

The menu offers a wide variety but we settled on the 9.95 lunch specials.\nThe sushi rolls, delicately set out, offered a clean and distinct taste variety. The chicken teriyaki, served with miso soup, two delicate dumplings and rice provided a tasty experience. The service, attentive and prompt, rounded out a reasonably priced and enjoyable lunch on a rainy day. Judging from our dishes I would imagine that dinners would be equally enjoyable.",

    "text": "In a semi sketchy neighborhood: check \nBar looks fairly hole in the wall: check\nThe seating is nearly impossible to get on a weekend evening: check\nYou shouldn't order anything but beer: check\n\nSeriously folks, don't be like the people I saw here and order a Chardonnay with your dinner...because it'll come from a mini bottle on a never dusted shelf of their never touched drink area. It's like the stuff you might get on an airplane. However, who in their right mind comes to black thorn for Chardonnay anyway??? It's all about the beer here.\n\nI know this place seems sketch...they do not even have a menu online. Oh noes, what will I do? Well if you have a hankering for Chicago style deep  dish pizza and you want to know what they offer you seriously need to call them or look at the yelp pics of the menu. If they give you sas, well I'd say that's expected of a grungy place, but that's not necessarily true. I really didn't get a good feel for their attitude here. \n\nWhen I was there it took forever to get a drink because of how \"busy\" it was, but like I said it was mostly expected. It's tiny and a bit rundown feeling like a dive bar. Not my favorite feeling but that's part of why they don't get 5 stars from me.\n\nIf it's busy you probably won't find seating immediately. The best solution is to scope things out and play some arcade games until something opens up! \n\nThe pizza here is seriously an awesome combo while you are drinking. I love deep dish, and while black thorn isn't my all time favorite, it's pretty good for st Louis. \n\nKeep in mind deep dish takes forever to cook and when you are in line for your pizza to be made it could take an hour, which means you might already be feeling the buzz of your alcohol kick in.",

Great dishes to share when you want an afternoon snack.\n\nEven with the renovations, the venue fills up fast. I would recommend scoping out a table while you are waiting in line.

There were about as many chips as you would find in a lays snack pack! The rosemary was very strong, but I like rosemary so I didn't mind. My friend had the pesto bruschetta. If you love pesto, this is the snack for you. It came with two very small pieces of bread with a small amount of goat cheese but absolutely loaded with pesto. The stuff was dripping off. My friend actually had to take some off because it was overwhelming. The atmosphere at Tr\u00eda is nice and the staff are relatively friendly. If you're coming for wine and cheese I am sure the experience will be more exciting.",

They had other special soups today that also sounded delightful like the beef stroganoff soup.  \n\nPotato soup with dill pickles mixed in. Picklelicious. Mike's Cuban Sandwich was pork, ham and cheese on French bread.  They replaced the traditional sweet pickle on it with dill pickle.   My Roast beef had onions and white cheddar cheese on it and horseradish sauce.  The sauce could have been a little tangier.  The sandwiches were large and easily handled our hunger.  We ended with a world's smallest ice cream cone. YUM. \n\nOf course we will be back.",

The employees are unusually helpful and friendly. They have a huge selection of everything. The produce is fresh. They have the usual cuts of meat, plus a section of freshly made options like stuffed pork loin, stuffed chicken, cajun burgers, blue cheese burgers, stuffed mushrooms, stuffed peppers, etc. \n\nI also feel that I should mention the alcohol selection, because I don't think anyone has brought that up in a review yet (kidding). So good... and cheap!!!\n\nThe bakery is amazing, as is the deli. As soon as you walk in, you can smell the fresh-baked goods. Oh, and in addition to their regular King Cakes during carnival season, they have sugar free for those diabetics out there. It's actually pretty darn good, too, but a bit on the pricey side compared to their usual competitive prices. However, this is a novelty IMO, so I'll let that slide.\n\nThe only downside for me is the narrow aisles and the parking lot where I feel like I'm going to get rear-ended, side-swiped, or possibly both at the same time by the old people in LARGE cars trying to fight over parking spaces. Do yourself a favor and park on an adjacent street, or in one of the side parking spaces if at all possible.\n\nThey need to open a location on the Westbank... just because it would be more convenient for me (no, I didn't deduct stars for this - just a suggestion).",

    "text": "Had a great breakfast here last weekend before we headed out. You order at the front and they will bring the food out. I had the French toast (fruit on the side)  with an a la carte fried egg on the side. They dropped my egg when they got to the table but promptly brought out another one. I also had a vanilla latte which was yummy....no extra sweeteners needed. \n\nWe sat outside on the patio which was just lovely. Even if you sat inside, like other restaurants in the French quarter, every door and windows are open, so fresh breezes flow throughout. Really nice experience.",

The prices are reasonable, the selection is extensive and the donuts are TASTY! I also like the unique options they offer such as the mini donettes and to-die-for cinnamon rolls. \n\nThe donuts were very fresh and light. I tried the apple streusel which was FANtastic and one with strawberry frosting and sprinkles. I liked that they didn't taste artificial or too sugary or heavy. If I had to pick again, I'd definitely pick this over the franchise chain competitor.",

Not a lot of seating but based on there niche it's probably expected. \nThey have a variety of options on how you want your dish. I went with the Jalape\u00f1o Poppers. Service was quick and my food was ready in no time. They do serve you your dish in a Rubbermaid type of container which doesn't look like much but it was very filling. The dish it's self was great, I loved it!! I would highly recommend this place for all  Mac n Cheese lovers.\nI also like how they encourage you to keep the container b/c it's reusable and encourages recycling.\nOverall service was good",

    "text": "Last weekend my girlfriend and I , both half insane with cabin fever, decided to walk up to Girard Ave and grab a bite to eat and a couple drinks. As we strolled we listed off our choices trying to make the decision as we walked...East Girard Gastropub, Kraftwork, Frankford Hall, Interstate 295...all good places to which we have already been. But as we passed each one they all looked like sardine cans. Instead of sardines they were packed with humans. Humans that smelled worse than fish in a can. So, we kept on. \n\nThen we passed Lloyd and decided to give it a try. My girlfriend loves whiskey,  the menu looked interesting, and it was busy, but not filled to the gills. So, in we went. \nMy immediate reaction to the decor/ambiance was that it felt like an upscale VFW. The bar is adorned with mismatched stuffed armchairs (cozy!) and fun vintage wall art that has a cabin in the woods and/or dark pool hall feel. There was something just a little off on the overall vibe. I got the sense that the owners had a limited budget to dedicate towards the design and decor. Maybe it was the startlingly white acoustical grid ceiling, or the Pergo floors that make that dreadful hollow knocking sounds when you walk across them, or maybe it was the off-the-shelf white folding residential closet door covering what I assume was a storage closet. This sounds overly nit-picky, but when I think \"whiskey bar\" I imagine a dark, dimly lit, cozy space with dark (real) wood accents and leather. Also, it lacked a good seating area adjacent to the bar. A overly wide space between the tables and bar felt like an unused dance floor. \n\nBut enough about the design of the space. Now to the important part. The food.\n\nI got suckered into some special cocktail that was made with a whiskey that aged for 6 months in some special aged oak barrel. It was yummy, but at $13 a pop - I didn't go for another round. For food bits we got roasted beets in a siracha honey glaze, chicken liver mousse pate with bread, and a mozzarella & prosciutto with broccoli rabe sandwich. I loved the beets and the chicken liver. The sandwich was  good, but basic. There wasn't a crumb left on any of the plates and the servings were pretty generous.  The two cocktails my ladyfriend had were also super yummy, and a much more reasonable $9 a piece.\n\nOverall I enjoyed my experience. The service was very good, the food hit the spot. I would go back again to try their other offerings. I only dwell so long on the ambiance of the place because I think they have a good thing going, but in a town like Philly where there are so many good restaurants with great atmosphere and design, a restaurant has to do more than make good food to survive long term. I hope this place continues to do well. It's great having another quality place to go to in Fishtown.",

Other than that the hotel provides a very friendly environment that's good for adults and families as well plenty of places to eat inside the resort and the atrium was amazing and really fun to explore. Little far from town but a good middle point between music row and the airport. Hotel staff was top notch and the place was clean while still having that old charm.

We always have awesome service too. My hang up can be the food. Wings not quite crispy enough, burgers not cooked to taste, spinach artichoke dip just meh. The steak and Gouda was flat out gross - big fatty slab of undercooked steak on bread. We were told it is leaving the menu, but they should have removed it long ago. And no visit from the manager when the sandwich was returned, which was a little underwhelming. We will be back, we are big fans, but please get your kitchen together so I can have my fav burger in town cooked just right :-)",

    "text": "Had a fantastic birthday dinner at Besito last night with my husband. Atmosphere is beautiful, upscale and romantic which was exactly what I was looking for. The food was quite good. My husband got the Camarones Ajillo and LOVED it. I mean loved it so much he destroyed the entire dish even though he was stuffed. I had the Enchiladas Suizas which was also good, might try something else next time though. (I didn't enjoy it as immensely as my husband enjoyed his meal, but no complaints.) \n\nTheir salsa is great, but unfortunately we weren't wowed by the tableside guac. Which made me a little sad because I love me some tableside guac, but it was okay. We got the medium spicyness so maybe we should have gotten the spicy and might have enjoyed it more. No matter, it didn't take much away from the evening. My sangria was top notch and after our meal they even brought me out a slice of tres leches cake (my favorite! how did they know?!) with a little candle in it. My husband didn't tell them it was my birthday so they must actually read the comments you put when you do an online reservation since I wrote that it was my birthday dinner. I thought that was very nice of them to do so.\n\nThanks Besito! We will definitely be back! Although, probably only for special occasions because it is a bit pricey. (Our total for both our entrees, tableside guac, a Dos Equis Amber, one glass of sangria and tip was a little over $80.)",

Enough flavors to keep digging in, tender meats, fresh munk beans, basil and not so quick yet efficient service. I also tried their charbroiled pork (#44) and it's really good. Just right.

I ended up having the empanaditas and a great cactus salad and was really impressed with the range of flavors. They have a wide ranging menu and several great sounding specials. \n\nWe also lucked out because the people next to us had thoughtfully brought more tequila than they needed and let us have a few glasses of the BYOT margaritas. The mixes were fresh and flavorful and they will mix the tequila in for you. \n\nOur only complaint was because it was so small, every margarita order meant we had to be very near a loud blender, but that's a small price to pay for excellent food, friendly service, and a lovely little restaurant.",

Fortunately, the tables are close together so we made friends with our neighbors, and ended up sharing our bounty with them.  Ha.  \n\nMost things were really good- we were starving though and waited over an hour to get seated.  The meat and cheese plate stands out.  I'm a sucker for cheese.  Other notable menu items are:  fried pickles (actually, they were amazing), french fries (sooo good), the lamb sliders weren't that good in my opinion, but the masses seem to like them (read in other reviews).  Something with mustard sauce, maybe egg rolls, or shrimp tempura were good- obviously, the condiment was the one that stood out to me.  That boolgogi bowl was really good too.  I think we had the mac and cheese too.  \n\nSo aside from this being a testimonial to me being a total cow- the main thing you should draw from this review is that, aside from the great music here, the food and drinks are good.  I think I stuck to wine because the cocktails were a little strange to me.  I'd go back.",

Light and delicious start to the meal.\n- Ceviche de Pescado: fresh, zesty, salty, overall one of the best ceviches I've ever had. \n- Lomo Saltado: tender tenderloin in a delicious sauce with rice. \n- Pescado a la Macho: fillet of snapper (boneless) fried in a well seasoned battered, top with a tasty tomato based sauce with a mixture of seafood (shrimp, squid, mussels, and baby octopus) on top. It does come with rice! ( there was some confusion about this). \n\nThe only disappointment I had was the dessert. We were between the Nutella cake versus the tres leches, and was convinced by the waiter to go for the flourless, gluten free Nutella cake. This was a mistake- hard, gritty, and low on flavor. What a disappointing way to end the meal! \n\nI will be back to try other menu items, and have already recommended this place to others.",

    "text": "While walking around Bourbon Street, it's a little frightening to see white powder riddled on the streets and plastered on peoples' noses.  Because of that, you might suspect people are sniffing cocaine due to their boisterous attitudes, but after eating beignet's at Cafe Beignet on Bourbon Street, I'm convinced that they are the reason for such things. Lol\n\nCafe Beignet offers better beignets than Cafe Du Monde and it's not even close.  They're far more fluffy, soft, well-sized, and deliciously powdered than any beignet I've had and it's only $3.99 for three!\n\nCafe Beignet has two locations--one being this one inside Musical Legends Park on Bourbon Street and the other on Royal.  I much rather prefer the one on Royal as it has a more clean and endearing environment.  This specific location on Bourbon is more fun and lively, but the distasteful smells of Bourbon Street creeps in from time to time.  I do love the live jazz music that is played though.  \n----\nConclusion: Those who are looking for 5 star beignets and a lively, musical atmosphere, come to this outdoor location.  I, along with Mr. Alton Brown (famous food critic on the food channel) agree Cafe Beignet is much better than Cafe Du Monde.  Come here for food, alcohol, music, and the best beignets! can be found here too!  \n\nExtra Notes:\n-Accepts credit card\n-Tables are available but be aggressive when trying to obtain one.  There are three tables upstairs near the restroom too\n-Service can be better as they're not very friendly or helpful\n-Restrooms are filthy",

I never feel like that at Bread Co. - busy or not.\n2) the prices are a little high.  Not a lot.  Just a little too high.\n\nThat's it.  I love going to the Daily Bread.

Definitely worth the less than $2 charge. \n\nThe ambiance was fine, having seating both inside (with A/C) and outside. It was cafeteria style.

We ordered the Ricotta cheese & toasted bread and although the flavor was excellent, I thought the bread to cheese ratio was off quite a bit. The ricotta came in a tiny ramekin typically reserved for flavored butters, so I expected more for an appetizer. \n\nThe two pizzas split among a couple of people were the sausage and the potato with rosemary. They were both tasty but I think they forgot the Rosemary on ours. Still yummy, tho! Another entree was the grouper w/Israeli couscous. Scrumptious!\n\nDessert was a must and the zeppoles, or sugared donuts, were amazing. The cherry tart a little less so, but one person at our table loved it, so maybe it was just not my cup of tea. The cherries were a sort of candied cherry-interesting, but sweet with a very dense crust. Again, just not my personal fave. \n\nI will definitely return to try other menu items that looked great-like the pastas made in-house daily...that's next!!",

The panang curry is also food, although they serve it on blanched cabbage and I'd rather they use a few other cooked vegetables.  The chicken satay is tasty.  The tom yum is mediocre.  The fried tofu is a bit rubbery.  There are limited thai restaurants in Nashville but this place is unassuming and service is attentive.  I really do like the flavor profiles here just wished some of the ingredients were a little more thoughtful.  In my opinion, the basil chicken is quite good - the elements fresh and at spice level 2 its just the perfect meal.

I've gone as far as to pick it up for dinner AFTER having had it for lunch. Their introduction of short-grain brown sushi rice has been great!\n\nThe Sushiman, YC Park is amazing to watch.  I've seen him skin a cucumber with a sword-like sushi knife in no time flat, in a single ribbon and then continue to shave it into a nori thin sheet for his tuna naruto roll roll.  The temaki are as big as a carnival iced cream cone.  You can barely finish one of them, there is so much fish in there.  The nigiri are beautiful.  Uniform pieces of fresh fish, perfectly perched on the best sushi rice I've ever had (just the right amount of vinegar and sugar).\n\nSkip the newly opened Kooma.  Save Mikimotos for a night out, but go to Tokyo for lunch!  The owners are lovely, so support them in this tough economy.  If you must eat sushi, eat it here!\n\nWhy not 5 stars?  I have to save it for places that serve the local fresh fish, plucked out of the water that morning.  Let me know if you find a place that does!",

I've tried the village burger and the whiskey king. they're both amazing, but I don't know if spending an extra $15 for the foie gras is worth it. It is nice to have foie gras like maybe once a year. Although the village burger is only $11, after you add all the extra stuff that they charge ridiculous price for, like mushrooms ($5), the burger will come out to like $20. It's totally worth it though.",

We would give it a 5 but we thought the tables and benches could be updated.

Came and refilled out chips once, cleared plates in good time as we were done, and just overall really nice. Again, didn't feel rushed at all which was prefect because we were watching the phillies game so stayed awhile after our meal. One dissapointing part though.. the smore bread pudding i was so excited for, completely not what i was expecting. It was basically two less dense chocolate brownies with a graham cracker sitting on top and marshmallow ice cream. Of course it tasted good but I wouldn've thought it would be a bread pudding with a graham cracker crust or something, not just a graham cracker thrown on top. So that's my only negative part about this place. \n\nFried pickle chips, delicious! Make sure you let them cool, they taste so much better when they're not burning hot.",

We started of with their pork & shrimp dumplings. They looked more like Shu mai which was different than what we expected but very delicious. They have 4 spice levels; mild, medium, hot, & Thai hot. They are not kidding around with how spicy their food is. Normally I order the Pad Thai the first time I visit a Thai restaurant but decided to try the spicier Garlic Beef at their medium spice level. It was delicious & perfectly spicy. The hubby got the Panang curry chicken, medium spice, & it was delicious & perfectly spiced too. The portion sizes were just right. We finished off our meal with their sweet, sticky rice with mango. OMG, it was the best I've ever had! They use the black rice & it was warm & drizzled with hot sweetened, condensed milk. The mango was perfectly ripe & there was more than 2-3 slices. We will definitely go back. The hubby wants to try something hot.\nAttention Vegans - they have a separate menu of dishes just for you!",

Unlike other fast food chains that use selections of one or more, from the following categories: frozen; prepackaged foods; processed foods; meats that have added [artificially] growth hormones; products that contain pesticides; and artificial flavored and colored food products. The Panda Express uses fresh vegetables and the cooks make everything in woks as the orders are taken. The food is delicious and freshly made.\nAccording to the website: businessfranchise.com, The Panda Express is a franchised business.\nWikipedia documents, as of June, 2015, there are 1,746 locations in the USA and Puerto Rico.\nAndrew Cherng and his parents are from Jiangsu, a province in China. In 1973, Andrew and his father, Chef Ming Tsai Cherng opened their first restaurant in Pasadena, CA. Andrew dreamed of sharing his father's authentic recipes, for delicious Chinese cuisine, with the American people. Andrew also wanted to offer a choice of delicious entr\u00e9es at inexpensive prices. As destiny intervened in Andrew's life, it just so happened that Andrew met Terry Donahue, the head football coach at UCLA and Dan Donahue who was Terry's brother, just so happened to have a Realtor company [Donahue Schriber Real Estate] that managed the Glendale Galleria, an upscale shopping center. Don offered Andrew the opportunity of a lifetime, to develop a fast-food version of his restaurant's entr\u00e9es and his father's delicious recipes.\nAs fate would have it, this was just the beginning of Panda Express.",

The mushroom pelmeni and potato and caramelized onion pierogies were big winners in my book. I was NOT a fan of the pickle bowl. All the veggies were overly salted and there was an unpleasant raw vinegar taste.\n\nThe picnic benches and friendly service create an inviting, laid back environment that won't tire you out.

Floor is noticeably worn down where the chairs are sliding back and forth at the tables. Bathroom was tidy but nothing exceptional by any means.

It was warm and fragrant and with all the condements they bring on the side, easy to customize. We also got BBQ pork sandwiches and they were very tasty. The meat was tender and flavorful and they had fresh herbs on them and some kind of yummy sauce. They only take cash, so make sure you hit the ATM before you go.

I recommend getting the special burrito, wet; both green and red sauces are good, but I prefer red. The combo meal satisfies too. Well-seasoned tri-tip (occasionally a bit tough) and chicken. I really like their salsa bar, but the salsas they have mostly aren't chip-dipping salsas like I think many people expect (they're primarily chili-based taco and burrito salsas; not tomato-based chip salsas). But get a couple of each and pour em over the wet burrito. I can't attest to the tacos, but my partner's had them and thinks they're solid, but not Lily's-level great.",

We arrived about 15 minutes early and had to wait on the bench back by the bathrooms for a few minutes.  However, as I said, we were earlier than they anticipated, and they got us to the bar as soon as seats opened up.  They wisely gave us a copy of the menu to be prepared once we were seated, and we did indeed plan our entire meal in advance.  This was helpful, because we were actually seated about 20 minutes late, and I was about to eat the menu itself as I drooled over the descriptions!  \n\nThe smoked fish dip and escolar with prawns were fantastic- the standouts of the meal.  The mushroom salad and tapenade were also very good.  The meatloaf was good, but a little on the dry and bland side.  I wanted to get the nachos, but there were no other takers in my group....next time....\n\nService was good.  It was a bit shaky at times, but it was slammed the whole time we were there and that small space must be tough to work in.  \n\nI would love to go back and check out their blue place special lunches...I have heard amazing reviews.

I applaud the change in style with the change in times. Too many places get stuck doing the same thing over and over again. I am glad to see that the food is still delicious. The Chicken Parm, Eggplant Parm, house salad and Alfredo are some of my favorites and they have great pizza. The alfredo sauce is made to order and taste amazing with their breadsticks. Some appetizer items leave something to be desired like the frozen cheesesticks or calimari. I would love to see these replaced with better quality items. Overall, I still love this place and would choose it over Olive Garden any day. I do miss the homey old school vibe from the old location but I also miss the good old days when people talked to each other, fragglerock ruled and hip hop was Wu Tang Clan. Oh well....",

It was more than enough for a meal but could have been split in two. The chicken was juicy and well cooked, but if you like spicy food you will need to add more hot sauce. The sides were also well made. I was interested in trying the bourbon whipped sweet potato but I'm glad I didn't. A friend had ordered it but didn't finish it because she said it wasn't good. I tried a bit of it and completely agreed. Idk if it was the bourbon or lack of seasoning but it just was not good. I usually will make plain sweet potatoes at home, boiled or baked, with a little salt and pepper and they have more flavor then this dish had. Other than that, what I enjoyed my meal.

Food is very reasonably price for the portion size. Appetizers run from $5-$10 and majority of sandwiches are $12. I didn't order any food but it looked amazing! Drinks are tasty and Prices are not terrible. Think 22oz Jai Alai for $8.50. You cannot take alcoholic beverages into the terminal (Columbia does this I think).

    "text": "A new, modern bar/restaurant has made it to the mundane town of Marana.  This bar does an extremely good job at doing what it has set out to do, provide customers with a fun and exciting upscale bar atmosphere with a great beer selection and good food.  Come here and expect just this.  Upon entering, one is greeted pleasantly, is presented a menu and is informed of the counter service.  The beers on tap are extensive ranging from a porter to a light pomegranate beer.  To top it off all of the beers are local.  After placing the order it arrives in a timely fashion.  The wings arrived first and presented attractively and were some of the best wings in the Northern Tucson Area (even better than the Ritz Carlton's Core).  The wings were plump, cooked to perfection and smothered in a sublime hot sauce.  After the wings, the burgers arrived with the French fries, both pleasant to the eyes.  After the first bite, I knew I would be coming back to DM Brewery again.  The high quality burger was cooked very well with the correct ratio of toppings.  To top it off, it was burger and beer night for $10.  Every night, DM Brewery has some sort of special deal going on.  They also have a good modern rewards program using an iphone/android app.  This is a great place to go with friends if your looking for a fun modern upscale atmosphere.",

    "text": "I finally made it to Hellas! The fact that I've kept it in mind for years tells you two things: \n\n1. I am lazy.\n2. Everyone talks about, therefore it is always embedded in my head. \n\nThe food was fantastic. Our table ordered the chicken souvlaki, combination platter, Greek salad, burger (yeah, there was one weirdo), and a side of dolmades. All delicious. \n\nThey were kind enough to allow me to purchase the side of dolmades despite it not being on the menu as a side. They were served with a lemon sauce and had a lot of meat inside. I am used to always having them without sauce and with mostly rice - this was a surprising and delicious change. \n\nI enjoyed the decor and artwork on the walls and ceiling, and the fact that the AC felt great despite us sitting close to the outside opening was superb.\n\nService was fast and friendly (except waiting for a waiter to initially be assigned to us - \"Hi! Yes, we're still over here!\"). Lots of looking at us and no one coming over. Once one of them did he was great. \n\nWe were STUFFED so no desert, but we must come back to try the bakery. Oh em gee so many huge and beautifully crafted treats.",

The restaurant is set up kind of like a high end fast food joint (although the food is MUCH better than your McDonalds.) You go to an order line in the front of the restaurant, place your order, and the food is then delivered to your table. The orders are each designated a number. Ours was 31. \n\nOverall, Edley's was great! the quality of food and service was superb. Not to mention, their bar-b-que sauce was unreal. I would highly recommend Edley's.",

    "text": "AJs products are incredible. Fresh, clean, super. Just look at the labels and realize what you are getting. You pay more, but you pay for what you get, and that's a lot. Want organics and quality? Incredible fruit and veggies section. Amazing beer and wine (my mouth watered at the $450 bottle of Dom Perignon!) There is amazing looking sushi prepared fresh. I bought a tiny baguette that is the freshest and tastiest bread I have ever eaten. The selection is amazing, you will find things from all over the world. They get rare and unusual items so it costs more. \n\nI don't think AJs is snobby. I did get some weird looks from the employees when I showed up in my ratty shirt and shoes, but I know what I want there and get great quality things that go into my body. And there are better and better deals the more you show up, just like any other grocery store. I'd rather get some things here than anywhere else in town. AJ's is a place to explore more. And there are no homeless people or ghetto customers in line , which I love!\n\nI probably can't or won't shop here too often since, you know, I like to pay rent and bills and stuff. But for specialty items and rarer beers and things, this is the place. It's also fun to browse. Totally good times.",

    "text": "Ooppps, didn't finish my review... Went to the Gaylord Opryland Resort while we were in Nashville. Did not stay there but came to visit the grounds and take the tour of the resort. After looking at the rates for the evening, the rates were very similar to those where we were staying. That does NOT mean you would get one of the rooms with the balcony overlooking the waterfalls, river and beautiful gardens. If you got one of those rooms for the price that was being advertised, it would be a great deal. \n\nFirst off, we parked in the parking lot next to the hotel. At a rate of $38 + tax [about $42 total] it was pretty expensive. We got to park right up against the hotel then realized that there is a free parking lot with a shuttle; ouch! The resort is completely enclosed so it is always 68 to 72 degrees inside. We took the river boat tour that is very informative and a nice couple of minutes to take a tour around the resort. Its about $12 and though we had to wait about an hour for it to be repaired, it allowed us to go to the island for a little shopping. By \"us\", of course I mean my wife and daughter. \n\nA very neat fact is that they sent empty bottles all over the world and asked them to send it back with local water.  Bottles came back from Europe, Africa, South American and other. I hope there was no disease in the Nile waters, uh no. So they take all the bottles and pour it into this man made river in a special ceremony. Who knows, there could be water from Chapala, Guadalajara; my Dad's  home town. Again, uh no.\n\nThe riverboat was fun and the very knowledgeable tour guide gave us some great info. We went to see some of the shops and unfortunately some of the shops were not open, such as the ice cream shop or cafe in the middle of the resort. \n\nIf we would have known about the free parking, this would have been a very inexpensive outing and a nice get away from the summer heat. I still think it was a great time to visit and enjoy the environment.",

    "text": "Beautifully sweet ending to a sweet trip to NOLA with the girls. We stumbled upon this after a delicous savory lunch nearby at Cochon (review to follow). Sweet Confections is on Magazine St, around corner from the art gallery strip on Julia St.   We had a sampling of cupcake (chocolate with mocha filling) and truffles (raspberry, creme brulee, and orange).  Cupcake was good, mocha filling best part. Rasberry truffle was my fav, love the dark chocolate so it's not cloyingly sweet. The coffee was a wonderful chaser, not overly burnt, smoky, or acidic... I usually have coffee with milk n sugar, forgot this time, but I didn't even need it!  Seating was nice, with a few cafe tables inside. Enough for our 6-girl troop. And service was great, helpful with flavor suggestions and labelling.  Gave 4 of 5 stars because maybe they could benefit from one more equally gracious staff person.",

The crazy part is that I was eating leftovers for two days after - which was impressive. \n\nThe second takeout order (last night) was excellent. It was water spinach, mango shrimp, and the seafood with vermicelli noodles and curry. The curry was very light, but the seafood was abundant and the mango shrimp was amazing. They also threw in a soup unsure of what it was (pork, corn, carrots) that was really tasty. Again - the leftovers from this order lastest for another two meals. \n\nI think I've found my go-to chinese takeout.",

Located in the heart of South City on Morganford, The Haven is all you can imagine in your quintessential neighborhood bar.  The inside is like a shrine to St Louis traditions. Walls glittered with plaques of the arch and Cardinals greats. Neon beer signs illuminate the hard wood walls; and make you feel like you're at your uncle's basement all over again. Here is a place to get to know the real locals, the real St Louisians who have lived here their whole lives. As I sat here, I observed how everyone knew each other, chiming in here and there about how so and so's daughter is doing, and etc, etc. The wait staff was warm and welcoming, and the bar is a place where you can sit back and be yourself.  I'm happy I discovered this gem, and the visit still sticks with me, because of how it brought me closer to know the city better.  I highly recommend anyone not from here to check this place out.",

    "text": "This restaurant gets its name from the fresh olive bread they serve - which is wonderful! The menu is rooted in old world Mediterranean fare, but has a slight modern flair, too. The weather was wonderful, so even though the outside eating area overlooks the parking area, we opted to sit outside. The grape vines on the trellises were beautiful and healthy and just about to burst into fruit! \n\nOur entrees included the walnut encrusted trout, seafood linguine - clams, shrimp, white fish, mussels, over bed of linguine, and a lamb kofte special.  The trout was a healthy serving and perfectly prepared. Clams, mussels and shrimp over a bed of linguine was another healthy portion and half ended up in a to-go box! Again, delicious, attractively presented and perfectly prepared.  Lamb is a personal favorite, but if I had it to do over again, I would've opted for something else. It tasted ok (meat was a bit dry)  but less than appealing appearance-wise: looked like two crisscrossed sausages. It came with a very thin (runny) yogurt cucumber sauce - not the standard tzatziki one would expect. Entrees will run you about $22, pastas around $16-18, so it's not overly pricey, but the addition of a couple adult beverages or bottle of wine can change that in a heartbeat.\n\nAll in all, it's a nice place with good food and attentive service. We all voted we would be back.",

The space is long and narrow but ample seating and bright and airy. The overall aesthetic is very pleasing. The pastry case by the late afternoon wasn't super filled but there were enough options to choose from like the lemon tarte which was delicious! The coffee menu itself is rather small. I ordered a mocha which was definitely a more bitter chocolate which I didn't mind, but if you're used to sweet like Starbucks this may be a pass for you. The people working here were nice. The prices were a tad expensive for coffee and pastries especially when the coffee isn't super elaborate. I also wish they would use real cups. They might have these but they didn't bother to ask if my order was to go or not. They offer bread for purchase as well. The staff was nice, the bathrooms clean.

We started with the tameles and were not a fan of the mushy texture...that's just me tho as I'm a texture person. The main more than made up for it.\n\nAtmosphere is really chill. I like the open concept and the tiny bar they had. \n\nThe owner was walking around chatting it up with every table. He came by our little counter/table and was super friendly and have us lots of background 411 about the restaurant (eg. Chicken is organic and is from local Four Whistle farm). It's nice to talk with owners and see/hear their passion for their business.\n\nWe ordered the platter for 2 with the rotisserie and pork. Seriously so much food. We had lots for leftovers. I wasn't a big fan of the chicken (it was cold) but the pork and the chimichurri was soooo good! It came with a side of potatoes that were pretty tasty also.\n\nFor dessert we had to have the churro and really enjoyed it as well!  \n\nThis is a great place for a date night. Nice atmosphere and good menu. We'd definitely go back to try something different.",

The vibe is laid back and the decoration is chic. There is seating outside and two types of seating inside: communal and counter top.  The counter has a small glass window so one can see the tattooed-artisans construct the pizzas.  With that in mind, we decided to take a seat at the counter.\n\nA vegetarian would be right at home with the menu, because majority of the pizzas do not have meat as a topping.  If you are looking for a pepperoni pizza, you're out of luck here.  We decided to go with the Salsiccia, which consists of roasted fennel and fennel sausage.  I ordered a glass of red wine to go with my pizza.  As I sipped on my wine, I enjoyed watching the pizzas get made and shoved into roaring fire of the wood-burning oven. \n\nThe pizza arrived looking delicious with the crust charred in a few places.  You can tell the toppings are sourced from top-notch ingredients.  The crust was thin and soft. I always have a soft spot for pizzas made in a wood-burning oven, and this pizza was no exception.  \n\nAll in all, I had a great pizza and a good experience.",

Today, I opted for the \"Homewrecker\":  a big, honkin' flour burrito crammed full of steak, black beans, rice, lettuce, sour cream, guacamole, cheese and pico de gallo (also available with pork, ground beef, chicken or tofu.)  All ingredients are fresh and packed with great flavor.\n\n - always a GREAT burrito...among the very best I've ever had!  (and filling, too!)  Also, their chips are made fresh and have a good flavor and crispness.  Finally, I like the choices of spicy and mild salsas.\n\nJust two nits:\n\n - Salsa service.  I HATE having to fill three or four small containers to meet my needs.  I'd prefer to have a choice of a larger container.  Also, the area is too small to permit you to comfortably set your meal and drink down while dispensing without fear of being nudged by another or passing customer.  More elbow room in the salsa area would be great.\n\n- Cleanliness.  It seems that the tail-end of the lunch hour gets greeted with a bit of a mess on the floors beneath the booths.  It would be great to have Moe be more mindful of cleaning underneath, as well as on top.  I'm not too crazy about tracking someone else's lunch back into my car!  Sweep it up, Moe!",

It's greasy unhealthy American-Chinese food thats cheap and has way too much salt. You know they don't serve general tso's in China right? But for what it is it's a cheap and solid dinner. The General Tso's Dinner box is is a typical combo of egg roll rice and the chicken. It's pretty good but I'd only say it's an average 3 stars, nothing sticks out. The real reason I order from Golden Chopsticks quite often is their fried meat dumplings. These are the thick heavy doughy dumplings, not the thin potstickers you might be used to and you get 8 with an order for less than 6 bucks. It's a lot of food and make sure you sleep with water next to your bed because it's very salty, in a good way. So again for what they are aiming for, they do a pretty decent job. Don't skip on the dumplings!",

    "text": "I've been waiting for what seems like ages for Lee House's latest restaurant to open up shop. Seriously, it's been in limbo since the spring time. What took so long? I guess, as the saying goes, you have to wait for the good things in life.\n\nAnyways, we had a little reunion with one of my buddies from out of town and went to check out Lee House's latest digs. The place was pretty packed for a Wednesday evening and is split into two different areas, the left side more compact with smaller tables while the right side is for bigger groups of families and friends. The restaurant has a very spacious, open air feeling and they clearly put a lot of time and effort into making things look great. I was hoping that they would put more of their focus on Korean BBQ, as Edmonton is seriously lacking a good place. We shall see, I'm sure things will change when they finish renovating their original Whyte Ave shop.\n\nWhile we were waiting for my buddy to show up, we perused the menu which has quite the variety of options. We decided to try several of their BBQ options but sadly, we didn't even get to grill any meat. Sad face. Also, I have to mention service was pretty weak, even for an Asian restaurant. We could barely hear when the waitress told us what our dishes were, had to ask for tea several times, and it was hard to flag down someone to take our order. I'm sure it will get better once they settle in.\n\nWe ordered:\n- Banchan and rice bowls - the banchan were all good, especially the bean sprouts and spinach. I just wish they brought out more/re-filled them during our meal.\n- Bibimbap ($10.95) - steamed rice topped with vegetables (carrots, spinach, zucchini, daikon, bean sprouts) over a lightly fried egg.  They brought out the Korean chili paste in a separate bottle, so you can add as much as you want. The bibimbap was decent but nothing to write home about. \n- Jap chae bokeum ($11.95) - potato noodles with mixed vegetables, black fungus mushroom in a sweet soy mushroom sauce. This dish was perfectly done! Noodles had the perfect chew. I think I just love noodles. Someone teach me how to make this at home.\n- Bulgogi ($14.95) - sliced beef marinated in a sweet soy garlic sesame sauce. \n- Spicy pork loin bulgogi ($14.95) - sliced pork loin marinated in a sweet onion, garlic chili paste. Slightly spicy, full of flavour, this was my favourite bulgogi dish of the night.\n- Sweet ginger pork bulgogi ($14.95) - sliced pork loin marinated in a sweet ginger sesame soy. I didn't get too much ginger flavour from this one, but it was still quite tasty.\n\nSo to sum up, first visit (of what I'm sure will be many) was pretty good. Lots of interesting items to lure you back. We'll have to make sure next time we try out their other BBQ items and do some grilling! I'm impressed with all the good Korean restaurants in town - make sure to add this one to your list of must try.",

    "text": "This market is small but has all of the essentials covered, in addition to some very tasty baked goods.  Some highlights from this year (opened in May, I think):\n\nDaily Loaf :  organic flaxseeds and whole-grain flour\n\nMarliscious: the pistachio torte cake is 3 fantastics layers of pistachio cake sandwiched between and enrobed in a pistachio-filled cream.  I have not found a pistachio cake anywhere else and this is just delicious.  The Prinzregententorte is amazing to even look at, with 8+ layers of super-thin sponge cake layered with chocolate cream and covered in a thin chocolate coating; it's very good and has just the right amount of sweetness.  She doesn't always have every cake every time, but you can always order a particular flavor.  \n \nFarm Fromage: creamy, organic goat cheese - it's delicious paired with a spring mix salad and glazed walnuts.\n \nFrecon Farms: hard cider.  need I say more?\n \nJimmies Cupcake Co.: James Taylor/Boston cream cupcake with a custard filling, vanilla cake, and chocolate frosting.  Personally, I just like the names.  Cupcakes taste pretty good, too, but aren't as fantastic as House of Cupcake's in Pton.\n \nLivengood Family Farm - grass fed ground sirloin - makes REALLY good, tender burgers\n \nMacDougall's Irish Victory Cake: You HAVE to try the sweet butter cake!  It's rich, buttery, and full of simple, delicious goodness.  They have other varieties but this is the traditional tried-and-true, and, in my opinion, the best.\n\nDefinitely stop by if you live in the area and don't feel like driving down to Reading or Ardmore for your farmer's market goods.  I only wish that they had more prepared foods and snacks, like sandwiches and roasted meats.",

The queso was SO good...I filled up on that before we got our main dish. I ordered the seafood enchiladas and while they were good, they use a red sauce instead of a cream sauce. I would have preferred a cream sauce but these weren't bad at all. My husband ordered beef fajitas and those were good, too.\n\nI had a few margaritas and huh....that's funny. I really don't recall much else about the place.\n\nOh yeah! It's good for groups. There were 6 of us and we all sat around a table laughing, cutting up, drinking the strong, strong margaritas, and eating the delicious queso.  Good service, good food, good times.

I don't know. \n\nAnyway, I've been in the area for 13 years and have passed Chinese Duck House a million times. I've always been kind of curious about it but I think the weird location is what deterred me from going. It's just a little teeny building set between 2 car audio places on busy Virginia st. It was just weird, ya know? But today I decided it was time. I was going to stray from my usual cheap and fast Chinese place AND TRY SOMETHING DIFFERENT. \n\nWhen I walked in I was pleasantly surprised at the kind of cozy feel it had. Don't get me wrong, it's definitely not a fancy date location. There are like 10 tables, a counter near the back, open kitchen and a fish tank. I love places with fish tanks. \n\nOnto the food. I was ordering to go for the BF and I. I ordered the tofu vegetables dinner combo with steamed rice and also the roasted duck with fried rice. You can request chow mein for a dollar more. The combos come with choice of soup (got hot and sour) and also fried shrimp, crab Rangoon, and egg roll. The food came out quickly and when I got it home I noticed it seemed quite fresh (sometimes cheap Chinese food is a little slimy for my tastes) The duck was plentiful and delicious, maybe a little too salty for some, but I really like salt. The veggies were vibrant and not too hard, not too soft. The fried rice was kind of weird, it just looked and tasted like steamed rice that they added some soy sauce to. No veggies or meat in it. The crab Rangoon was a little overcooked but nothing to be real upset about. \n\nGood meal and I'm glad I stepped out of my comfort zone. I'd like to give their (very limited) dim sum menu a try sometime soon.",

They have great mozzarella sticks that come with a marinara sauce and a ranch sauce for dipping. The gumbo, though not outstanding, was very good. For breakfast one morning, I got the 3 egg omelette and I chose to stuff it with andouille sausage and pepper jack cheese. It was delicious.

    "text": "First - Dear YELP admins, how could the word \"hoagie\" fail your spell checker? C'Mon already!\n\nEveryone has a favorite steak shop or two and they can be as different as night and day. White House, Tony Luke's, Geno's, Pudge's - like comparing apples and pigs, or Wilt to Magic, or Kung Fu to Karate, you just can't compare iconic examples different styles.\n\nLarry's is like that. I've been coming for 30 years. Once or twice, I even stepped up to the Houseway Belly Filler. I think this was the first place I ever had a meat topping on a steak sandwich (pepperoni), but it wasn't the last. \n\nWhat makes Larry's Larry's? First, the guy is cooking in the window. Next, the steaks are chopped. Not shredded, fluffed, laid out or shingled. Even the toppings on our chicken cheese steak hoagie were chopped - a devout nod to every-bite-the-same sandwich science. A lot of work goes into every steak. Finally, the fresh Amoroso-style roll is just a little toasted, not enough to be a grinder, but certainly not steamed on the grill like an AC sub. \n\nWhen on Hawk Hill and hungry go to Larry's. Is it the best steak ever? Nah, but it is an institution and true to itself. As you take your first bite, envision yourself bustin curfew on the way home from seeing Neil Young at the Spectrum, or watching the Sixers take the NBA crown, or sweating whether Y2k will crash your Palm II. If you twist my arm, Larry's doesn't crack my top 5, but tradition is tradition, and Larry's has stood the test of time for good reason.",

    "text": "I consider myself a sushi snob, and I was a bit concerned by the 3.5 star rating... and then we showed up to an empty restaurant on a Saturday night... Total red flag, but my 5 friends all wanted to stay. And I'm so glad they did! Wow!\n\nThe food was amazing! They did a great job with the chirashi, miso soup, \"monkey brains\" (fried mushrooms), hamachi nigiri, and a crazy awesome roll called the Imperial Dragon or something like that, which showed up at our table in a dragon-shaped foil wrap and ON FIRE!  It was so good that we had to order a 2nd one. \n\nThe only reason for the 4 stars instead of 5 is value. The sushi is more expensive than average, and the $20 chirashi only came with 6 pieces of sashimi (+2 masago and 2 crab sticks), much fewer than every other place I've been to.\n\nThe rice was great though, in spite of what some other reviews may say. And the staff and service were great too!",

You can walk through the line and select options for entree, sides and dessert. You may also order off the menu. We ordered, fried oysters, fried catfish, baked catfish, mashed potatoes, cabbage, broccoli, pasta side dish, roasted potatoes and green beans. Cornbread was extra at 75 cents. Everything was delicious except the fried oysters. The batter used for the oysters was different than that used for the catfish. The oyster was more battered versus breaded. If the batter for the oysters was the same as the catfish, they probably would have tasted great. Dinner with one entree and 2- meat platter was $13.99 with 2 sides.\n\nDefinitely worth a visit for delicious food.",

    "text": "Katie's is a must for those seeking New Orleans contemporary classics.\n\nThe poboy list was astounding, and great contemporary takes on such things as 'Oysters Rockefeller'.\n\nThe chicken andouille sausage gumbo was fair. I've had better at various other establishments. A lack of rice, a lack of \"trinity\" (seasoning) and sparse nuggets of andouille and chicken were certainly a disappointment. The roux was the perfect darkness, but it lacked body and substance. I wouldn't have it again, and I don't recommend anyone try it, especially if you have had a good gumbo. It will fail to please.\n\nThe red beans and sausage were awesome. Creamy, with a great mouth-feel, superbly seasoned, the red beans may be the best I've had -- and I've been frequenting New Orleans restaurants for over three decades. The sausage was a great example of a good smoked sausage with a hint of piquant, crispy on the outside, and moist and tender on the inside. Now, the rice... why is it something so simple could ruin an otherwise perfect meal? First, red beans (unless you're serving soup) is traditionally served with rice. Rice should be fluffy, warm, and moist. This was obviously left in a steam pan with no lid. It was dry, hard, brittle, and inedible. Why even serve the stuff? Rice is cheap, make another batch, don't serve something you wouldn't stand behind!\n\nThe service was absolutely terrible. I had to wait to get a drink order (7 minutes, I timed it). I had to wait to get my drink (8 minutes, timed again). My food order was taken by another waiter who saw I had not been served, and by the look on his face, felt sorry for me. My waiter did not check on my food service until after I had finished my meal -- fortunately, the owner did check on me. I even had to wait to pay my bill -- which to me, if someone is looking to pay and leave, and you're in the business to generate revenue -- it's important to make sure they have the bill and make a timely payment.\n\nAfter all the negative reviews, why would I give Katie's such a high rating? Well, I will tell you. A) The Food. B) the atmosphere C) I'm not going to let a worthless server ruin a good establishment D) the owner took an interest in my experience.\n\nTry Katie's for yourself. If you have as bad of a serving experience as I had, inform the owner. I did not, and I regret it.",

My wife settled on pistachio and amaretto. Both were really good, but I think the pistachio was a bit better. \n\nWhile the flavors of gelato were quite good, I have to agree with Brenner T.'s review that says that Allegro is a better quality product than Frost. If you compare the gelato here to the same flavor at Allegro, it will lose. But Frost's strength is the variety - many more flavors than Allegro. And the gelato here is still quite good - a solid 4 stars. But I wouldn't take an Italian here looking for authentic stracciatella gelato. \n\nFrost also benefits from its location - next door to two very popular restaurants - Sauce Pizza and Wine, and Wildflower. It's a great spot for some light dessert after a meal.",

It was delicious, though for my taste it could have used more capers. My wife had the Bananas Foster French Toast and loved every bite of it. The fresh OJ was ridiculously fresh (as expected) and lived up to our high expectations.\n\nWe walked to Surrey's from the Hilton (located \"Riverside\", just outside of the French Quarter.) Although an easy walk, we passed through the slightly sketchy Highway 90 underpass. Otherwise, our walk was nice. The few houses we saw walking into the Garden District were pretty cool: it's called the \"Garden District\" for a good reason. If you are visiting New Orleans (as we were), I recommend taking the walk. (Consider stopping by the World War II museum on the way back if you are staying near the French Quarter!)\n\nUnassuming and standing among beautiful Garden District houses, Surrey's has a unique neighborhood diner ambiance. Surrey's was likely once a typical residence; today the kitchen takes up the original first floor and the dining area appears to have been a  patio or porch (it's now all enclosed and interconnected now.) Seating is tight and the walls are decorated with knickknacks. Don't expect fine dining - expect great food.",

    "text": "My SO, friend and I tried this place around 5:45pm Saturday night. Upon entering, the hostess asked if we had a reservation, which we did not but the front room looked pretty vacant so we figured it'd be no problem. They proceeded to take us to the furthest back area of the restaurant where the cooks are (you can see them because they work in a window enclosed space) and seated us right by the windows to their kitchen area. \n\nOur servers were prompt and friendly, it was still happy hour so we ordered a door#three, a rye drink and a beer. We were brought waters pretty quickly, my SO's had something in his and they quickly replaced his water upon informing the waiter. The happy hour prices are reasonable, half off the normal price which for cocktails was $11 but not sure how much the beer was. For appetizers I ordered the Bibb lettuce salad, my SO ordered the gumbo, and they bring bread and butter out immediately. Everything was good out of the appetizers and bread, we ate every bit of it \n\nFor the entree I ordered the chicken dish with rosemary potatoes and my SO had the fried oysters, my friend had the shrimp and grits. Everything was very delicious and cooked perfectly. \n\nDuring our meal we noticed that one of the chefs put his finger in his mouth and then proceeded to handle foods with his bare hands. We thought we should probably tell someone, so we asked our waiter for the manager and a male manager came over. We informed him of what we had seen and he said okay, not seeming too concerned. He promptly walked off to go tell someone in the kitchen, \"that table over there says he put his finger in his mouth, I don't know how accurate that is but that's what they said.\" Mind you, we are witnessing all of this due to the glass, and the manager is facing us and the kitchen when he says this. I went up to said manager and inform him we just saw everything he said and that's incredibly disrespectful. We had no reason to lie about it, as we already had our meals and had eaten. I was simply concerned for whose dish that was being handled. Our waiter quickly apologizes profusely and I point out that he did nothing wrong and it's not he who should be apologizing, but the manager - to which the manager stands there and says nothing. Our waiter went to go get DeDe the head manager and she came over, addressed our concerns with poise and was extremely kind. We would come back again because of how well she handled the situation.",

If so, all I could get is a blackened black bean burger.One late afternoon, I found this joint near the Barnes & Noble. I ordered a Fajita wrap, sweet potato fries and ginger soda. \n\nThe wrap was pretty good and so did the fries. The ginger soda went well with them. This would be my go to place, if I am roaming around this area.",

When I think of eating at Anthony's, I start salivating.\n\nThey have an outdoor area with an indoor/outdoor bar separating the patio from the restaurant. \n\nMy go-to order at Anthony's Coal Fired is a large Proscuitto and Onion pizza with the proscuitto baked (they can either top the pizza with after it's cooked or bake the proscuitto with the rest of the pizza). The saltiness of the procsuitto mixed with the fresh parmesan cheese and saut\u00e9ed onions is the perfect combination. We split this between two people and always have a slice or two left over for breakfast the next day. If we only have one slice leftover, watch out.. it's a race to see who gets the last piece first!\n\nLet's talk about the baked wings.... really, really, really good. I actually didn't get them for the first time last night and the first thing my boyfriend said to me was \"no wings?\". The wings are baked in the coal oven and have a great charcoal taste to them. They serve them with onions and focaccia bread which are equally as delicious.\n\nAside from the food being down right delicious, the service is always excellent for take out, dine in, or even if you're just sitting at the bar.",

It was not too sweet and you get nice bites of pecan; a nice hot coffee is a perfect compliment.The cupcakes were good (cake wise) but, not a huge fan of the icings.

Loved the donuts and the coffee's flavor was solid, but it could have been hotter. Although, on the plus side, I didn't have to wait for it to cool down before I could drink it. Our desert was followed by the cheesy blue corn grits with all the extras (I.e. a soft poached egg, scallions and bacon bits). I'm late to the grits game but I loved them. My lovely wife had the bialy (think bagel) and lox, and miso soup. She is more of a foodie than me and a chef to boot. She was quite pleased. Service was average to good. It was cool sitting at the  counter. We got to watch the chefs in action. There was a taller female that was very focused and professional, more than most. When she wasn't cooking she was prepping and/or cleaning. Not sure why this wasn't a five star rating, probably the average service. In the end we had a great dining experience. It was pricey but you pay for what you get.",

While it still has that subway blue and white tile, the walls have been painted red and more tables have taken he place of a high counter.

However, our experience overall was positive and eventually the place started to fill up.\n\nWe shared a basket a fries, a chili cheese dog, and a cheeseburger.  All were good.   The chili cheese dog was quite large.  The burger tasted fresh, not frozen, as did the fries.   The rolls are a bit large relative to the amount of meat but were definitely a better quality than the usual burger place.  $14 for these thee items.\n\nI was put off by the fact that we asked for two cups for water and the guy at the counter put the cups lip down onto the counter.  Used a straw to drink.   The same guy asked us is we wanted to \"start off with a milkshake.\"  Uh no, it's 40 degrees and raining out.\n\nThe place is wheelchair accessible with a ramp in the front and a h/c accessible restroom.",

But regardless of the details i travel long, far, and wide for a good breakfast. My next stop on this adventure was Skyway Jack's, now this isn't the original Skyway, ill make my way to that one at some point. But this one was closer to work and i decided to shoot over and see what all the hype was about. And from my visit the hype was well deserved. Now there were a couple of glitches when i got there, they were down a waitress so one poor soul was stuck working the whole room, and the service suffered because of it. Mainly my omelet came luke warm. I was dissapointed but i took the situation into consideration and decided to give them a pass. When i dug in i was extremely pleased. HOME FRIES, get the HOME FRIES. This is what home fries are suppost to taste like, not bland, and tasteless. These ppl do it right, the omelet was delicious aswell, the hash was good. Was dissapointed at the quality of the biscuit, but aside from that everything was pretty wonderful. Now its not at the level of Kissin Cuzzins, or Frog Pond. Who at the moment i consider the mecca's of Pinellas County breakfast. But its just a notch below. 4 stars for Skyway, def worth checking out. They also have some cheaper breakfast options for those not wanting to spend $7 on an omelet. We can't all be high rollers like me.........lol",

The new restaurant is BEAUTIFUL, love the memorabilia and the setting in general.  The staff that we had were fantastic, the reason I'm giving this a 4 star otherwise I'd have to give a 3.  Our table had fish and chips, the Shrimper's Heaven, a shrimp cocktail and a caesar salad.  The Fish and chips were hot but the pieces were very small, it wasn't what we expected.  The shrimp in the Shrimper's Heaven was great but unfortunately the fries were barely warm.  The shrimp in the cocktail were huge, and the salad good, I'd say the cocktail was the best part, although it was $17.  Overall it is a fun restaurant and I'd go again but maybe for a special treat as it was fairly expensive.  I'm still happy Bubba Gump is here!",

So we were not to jolly to start out, but a host did seat us and he was friendly and good to us. We split the soup of the day which was corn chowder, easily the best I have ever had.  Not too thick, not too thin, well seasoned and cooked just right.  There were some red and green bits in it that added to the flavor and appearance. \n\nMy entree was the southern chicken dish.   The coating was excellent and cooked just right.  I think the chicken underneath could have been better, but I am a bit of a chicken snob.   You can't beat a free range chicken.  The baked beans were like the soup above in terms of quality - just excellent. I had the sweet potato fries which were also spot on.  The green beans were over cooked.  \n\nBeth ordered the southern chicken salad.  The batter was good and the chicken was tender.  She had hoped for more ingredients in the salad but it was good. \n\nThe waitress was wonderful and prompt. She kept the iced tea glasses full and it was fresh iced tea.  The chocolate cobbler desert was baked to order and top notch.  \n\nThe entertainment was top shelf.

    "text": "Cool place! Cute little wine bar in a retro filling station in a residential neighborhood near the Botanical Garden.  The waitress was very knowledgeable about wines and the manager came over and introduced himself and talked to us for awhile. I went with two other friends and we also ordered some light food.  I had a Turkish pizza which was incredible. Nice relaxing atmosphere. We sat inside as it was a little muggy, but the outdoor patio was open where they were showing some silent black and white movie. We also took a tour of the basement where the wine cellar and a  private tasting room are. And if you go up the stairs, there is a restaurant, which I believe is in a former apartment, Elaia, which may be a future trip. I will return to Olio and also want to check out the pastry shop across the street, Choquette, which was closed that night. The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because it's small and kind of cramped, and I can imagine if we had gone there at a busy time, there would have been nowhere to sit.",

    "text": "Hanging out in Society Hill rarely happens for me, due to the saturation of wonderful bars and restaurants in my own neighborhood, but the urging of multiple friends and a birthday party finally brought me over to \"So-Cheet\" last night.\n\nWe hung out in the cozy, dark basement lounge, which was pretty great.  From 10-12 on Saturdays (and maybe Thursdays and Fridays as well?) they have a late night happy hour.  The special was $5 house margaritas.  While that may not sound like the most amazing deal to happy hour cheapskates, trust me - it is.  Sauza blanco, hand-squeezed lime juice, and simple syrup made for a tasty drink.  I like when you can actually taste the tequila in a 'rita.\n\nWhile we weren't here for a full meal, we did try a few of the snacks:\n\n-queso fundido: Delicious melted chihuahua cheese, served with piping hot fresh tortillas, mushrooms, pickled red onions, and peppers. I really loved those red onions.  I could bring home a jar of those.\n-the chicharrones: pork rinds served with a dangerously spicy salsa verde.  Again, amazing.\n\nService was attentive and friendly, and a DJ was spinning hip hop and funk.  I had a really great time here, and have to come back for a full dinner.",

    "text": "If you are looking to be impressed by French-German dishes in New Orleans, please go to Luke Restaurant, I know I was. \n\nThe restaurant is located in the Central Business District, next to the Hilton and in the former Masonic Temple Building, so there is that historic vibe to the restaurant. The front room is a lot more grand than the back room (where we were seated), but that is offset by views of the open kitchen. \n\nApparently they only want to seat people with reservations, so since we did not have one, we were refused seating until 9:15pm (it was 6:45pm) but with a little back and forth, we ended up waiting only 15 minutes before we were seated. However, as we walked through the restaurant to the back room, way too many tables were empty that it made no sense that they acted that way. A lot of tables still remained empty throughout the meal.\n\nI decided to start out my meal with a cocktail. I originally wanted the Mint Julep but they were out so I had the Riverbend (vodka, lemon juice, basil syrup, blueberries & ginger ale) at the recommendation of the server. It was a relatively sweet cocktail, with the ginger ale being the most powering flavor, but you could still taste the alcohol.\n\nMy friend choose a regular starter and ordered a cup of the Crawfish Bisque. She ate all of it so I am assuming she liked it, but she did complain of a sour aftertaste.\n\nMy boyfriend skipped the appetizers and went straight for the entree. He always seems to find the most basic item on the menu and order it. He had the Luke Burger (bacon, caramelized onions, tomatoes, Swiss cheese) and was raving about it. One thing I can tell you, it was a very good size. \n\nMy friend had the Jumbo Louisiana Shrimp \"En Cocotte\" with lump crab meat, roasted jalape\u00f1o cheese grits, andouille & green onion sausages. She loved it.\n\nI have an obsession with mussels so I had the classic Moules et Frites. Although only having two simply ingredients (garlic & thyme) in the broth, the flavors stood out and the taste was a lot bolder than others I have had with a lot more ingredients. The house-made fries were scrumptious. These are the best kind.\n\nEven with all that food, we still made room for dessert. We first had the Bread Pudding which was delicious but quite sweet. I am also not a fan of over sauced foods.\n\nOne wasn't enough so we also ordered the Bourbon Vanilla Bean Creme Brulee. It was superb and not too sweet which is a plus for me. The little cookies on top added nothing to the dessert and if anything could have been left off.\n\nAll that good food, I still have to give props to our server. He was amazing and engaging. The front desk soured the mood a little bit a first but he more than made up for it. I couldn't have asked for anyone better.",

    "text": "This review is mainly chicken talk as Cuenelli's Peruvian Style Rotisserie Chicken brings to the table. Pollo a la brasa.... Rotisserie chicken.... Whatever you wanna call it.... I call it a technique done here with love and pride. Lets be clear, you will find no comparison coming from your grocer deli section or at the checkout isle.\n\nWhy do I think this chicken have some TLC put into it? On biting down of this chicken you can note seasoning flavors down to the bone. This is an inclination that prior to even getting into the rotisserie oven, these birds spend some time in some form of marinating process. Building flavor, the chicken also has a seasoning rub all over the skin.\n\nLets go to this rotisserie oven. Another unique element is this oven has a charcoal or grill like component. This gives the chicken a smoky element in the flavor build. As these birds turn in this oven, they keep moist from the natural drippings dropping from bird to bird as they rotate through this oven. In turn, this a reason why some people may note some pieces the skin end up dry and crispy and others get moist or soggy skin on their chicken In the end, you end up with this tender, smoky, well seasoned, fall off the bone goodness. Wait.... how can they add more flavor? Cuenelli's serves it with two dipping sauces, a chimichurri  which gives a herbaceous and slightly spicy flavor, and an aioli which has a garlicky - lemony element.\n\nRound out this meal with some solid sides. Must haves for me would be the cilantro rice. Another herbaceous addition that works well with this meal. I got to use the word herbaceous a few times in this review, it has reflects such great imagery for food talk:) Must have beans with rice no? I pick the spicy pinto beans over the black beans at this establishment but lets be clear these beans are pretty spicy. I also love the maduros here. These sweet plantatains are cooked to perfection where the outsides has this caramelization from the natural sugar of the sweet plantain, leaving you with this toffee-like, stick to your tooth exterior and soft and sweet interior. \n\nWash all down with Inca cola or a bottle of chicha limena.  Inca cola is almost like a cola champagne or a cream soda type of drink. Chicha Limena I say is Christmas in a bottle. This juice has a floral base blended with cinnamon and cloves.\n\nThough Cuenelli's Peruvian Style Rotisserie Chicken have many other notable Latin dishes, the one thing that comes to mind to me is this chicken made with love. This chicken gives new meaning to all who thought they knew what rotisserie chicken is. I say, go to Cuenelli's and taste again for the very first time.",

    "text": "It's Memorial Day. What better food than a burger?! We're out of town and didn't know what was available (other than the typical fast food joints and Five Guys). We narrowed our search to Burger Up and Cheeseburger Charley's. We settled on Burger Up and boy am I glad.\n\nI'm a fairly picky eater and hamburgers are one of my favorite foods. Unfortunately, all too many places really mess-up a hamburger (Five Guys included). We read some reviews here on yelp and still couldn't be certain we were making the right decision. Someone complained about \"family style seating\" (sitting with strangers) and another mentioned a \"dorked-up\" PB&J.\n\nFirst, let me say that the decor was quite unique. There were only a few tables where you risk sitting with strangers and I'm certain you could tell the hostess that wouldn't be preferable. Honestly, though, life's short. Chill-out and make the best of it. Are you really that unsociable?! The menu plainly states that it's grilled. Who's ever eaten a grilled PB&J?! If that's not what you're looking for, don't order it.\n\nFinally, for the burgers...\n\nI ordered the classic burger with white cheddar cheese and was completely satisfied. Someone complained that it was dry. You must have gone on an \"off\" night, because our burgers were juicy and quite tasty. The server told us that we could opt for Heinz ketchup, if we didn't like their house ketchup, but who wouldn't like their house ketchup? Good stuff. You also have a choice of regular fries or sweet potato fries. We didn't get regular fries, but their sweet potato fries were great, too!\n\nOkay, so no restaurant is perfect. Our server, Daniel, was great. Ambiance and food was great. The sweat tea was not good, nor was the lemonade.\n\nThere you have it. What they are known for -- burgers -- were definitely worth it. I think someone complained about the cost. We spent $35.00 for two, but where do you not spend that much for two (including a tip).\n\nWe'll definitely be back...",

We had the Dr. Dave roll, the Choo Choo roll, and a roll our waitress recommended that was topped with mango.  All three were delicious!

We got lucky because it was Fall break at Vanderbilt so we got in right away.  The decor is very low key so don't expect high end service and decked out chic crowds with funky music ala Pod in Philadelphia.  The focus of Samurai is the food, period.

    "text": "Took the whole fam jam, including Gramma, out to Wok House last night in St. Albert.  We've been eagerly awaiting the opening this past week because their banner outside read:  Chinese, Dim Sum, Bubble Tea!  Yep, that's right - St. Albert now has Dim Sum and Bubble Tea!!!\n\nThe location is in the old Banana Leaf Restaurant next door to Simply Donair in the same strip mall as Dairy Queen.\n\nWe were greeted by a friendly family who let us choose anywhere in the restaurant to sit - kiddos opted for the booth/bench option.\n\nThe decor was modern and clean.\n\nThe menu variety REALLY surprised me and all Dim Sum is cooked to order rather than coming around on carts. \n\nWe decided we might as well go hard and try stuff from all parts of the menu.\n\nFirst off, we ordered bubble teas:\n\nFresh fruit mango dairy free with sago, fresh fruit peach dairy free with sago, and milky matcha green tea with sago.  ALL WERE EXCELLENT.  The waitress waited to see if I liked he matcha because she warned that it's not very sweet and said she could make it sweeter if I preferred but I'm a matcha monster and this was exactly what I was looking for :-)  \n\nNext up, they brought out a couple of small appetizers for us to share in celebration of their opening - spring roll, tempura shrimp, and a dry garlic rib:  all were excellent with my 7 year old requesting more of each!\n\nWe decided to share the dinner for 2 which came with spring rolls, chicken fried rice, 2 bowls of soup (won ton and hot & sour were both decent) and 2 entree choices:  we selected Honey Pepper Shrimp (DIVINE) and sliced Szechuan beef. \n\nBoth of the mains were good and flavourful with a good amount of sauce.  Everyone in our group noted that the use of onions was pretty heavy and more peppers, corn, carrots, etc. would be nice.  I'd say the dishes were at about 1/3 white onions - usually this is a deal breaker for me but the sauces and meat quality were superb. \n\nNext up was our never ending sampling of Dim Sum:\n\nPork Buns - $4.99 good but smaller than most; my daughter didn't care for them here  and neither did Gramma (not sure why).\n\nSticky Rice (Excellent but it only comes with 2 small leaves for $4.99 - this could be vastly improved by adding a 3rd one for that price or putting more rice in each banana leaf.  Literally, the banana leaves had less than 1/2 of the amount of rice you would have at Jumbo). \n\nBeef skewers - not as pictured and not up to snuff in my opinion for $4.99 for 2.\n\nGreen Onion Cake - $4.99 a standard that my kids will insist on every visit though I prefer mine to be a little crunchier.\n\nPan fried meat dumplings - $4.99 standard but they don't bring red wine vinegar or whatever that sauce is most Dim Sum places serve with it.\n\nCurried Squid - $4.99 Excellent and tender but I would LOVE the sauce to be a bit thicker and more plentiful to pour all over my rice :-)\n\nWe'd order 80% of the food again and to be able to have Dim Sum in St. Albert any day of the week at any time, we will most DEFINITELY be returning here.  \n\nEven if Mom and Dad want regular Chinese food, the kids in our house will jump for joy at Sticky Rice, Green Onion Cakes, and Bubble Tea!\n\nService was friendly but slow tonight with our dishes coming as much as 60 minutes apart - YIKES!  But I won't fault them on this as they work out their bugs, hopefully in the future we will get things (like rice) before the rest of the meal.\n\nCheers Wok House, can't wait to come back!\n\nP.S. They deliver, too!",

Clearly a difference in 4-5 extra bits worth of omelet. \n\nIf you have a sweet tooth, any of french toasts are great! Fancy Breakfast Sandwich is great! I substituted the prosciutto with bacon and got great results! Great mimosas!",

The location in NoLibs is on a sketchy street with nothing else around it. The donuts are really good too but the fried chicken is the star here.",

    "text": "They would have gotten 5 stars if it weren't for the margaritas\n\nSeriously this place is BOMB.\n\nI've been here a few times now and tried a bunch of different things. A MUST GET is the Veggie Wings appetizer. I'm not a vegetarian, but SHIT these things will rock your world. It's seitan and it's just a little crispy, awesome wing sauce and your choice of blue cheese or ranch.\n\nThe pickle chips (fried pickles) -- awesome as well! They come with this spicy mayo dipping sauce. And they're so so worth it. \n\nThe menu is split up into texas-style and mexican-style. I've had stuff from both sides. Pretty much can't go wrong.\n\nThe tacos were delicious. I had the carnitas (YUM), my friend had the vegetarian cactus and sweet potato (she said they were amazing).\n\nThe service is awesome. They're friendly and fast without being pushy. Great people watching.\n\nThe only bad thing are the margaritas. Not sure what it is about them, but not my favorite. But definitely not a deal breaker, next time I'll just get a beer!!",

All were yum yum. Then got the fried chicken slider oyster, duck, and pork belly sliders. Fried chicken was the best. All needed more spread/sauce but still yummy. Most affordable lunch we had in NOLA",

    "text": "My first experience did mot go well due to the heavy accents of the employees. I called ahead so my order would be ready for me to pick up and it was, it just was not what I ordered. They are nice people and corrected my order but instead of simply picking up my food I had to wait 20 minutes To get my original order. When all was said and done, the food was good.\n\nI was nearby and decided to give them a second chance. This time I ordered a pizza steak and I was really impressed! I need to have a couple more before I can declare them my new favorite pizza steak. Plenty of mozzarella cheese and the roll is stuffed with meat and just enough sauce. It's looking like this place is a lot better than my first impression.",

If you're still okay with drinking cold drinks before work when it's 20 degrees outside, head to Starbucks. \n\nThe staff is friendly, the drinks are delicious (although they are overpriced) and all of the Christmas goodies inside are awesome. \n\nGreat place to relax or prep for a work day. \n\nSee you again soon Southport Starbucks!",
