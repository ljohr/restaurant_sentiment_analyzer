    "text": "Came here and was delighted to see nothing but Taiwanese people (Authenticity).\n\nServer asked if I wanted the Taiwanese menu, I asked for the English Menu and went with:\n\nBraised Beef Noodle Soup: 3.5/5 - Recommended by server.  Chewy noodles, beef was lean and tender, soup had nice touch of star anise, but nothing special though.\n\nScallion Pancakes: 4.5/5 - Delicious.  It was nice and crispy on the outside and had a soft, chewy texture on the inside.  Paired well with the dipping sauce.\n\nCrispy Pork Roll: 1.5/5 - Disappointing.  The pork was off. It was a meat mixture that was flavorless.\n\nPopcorn Chicken: 4/5 - Can never go wrong ordering this anywhere.  The basil was awesome. Great portion.\n\nSchezuan Eggplant: 3/5 - Tasted awesome, but was way too oily!  Was not spicy as I thought it would be.\n\nOverall, it was just average.  There is not a lot of places to eat that is close by to the casino (that I know of).  I just wanted to try something new and opted for restaurants outside the casino for a change...",

I ordered the vegetarian meal, and it was the WORST veggie meal I've ever had :(  My meal came with soup and rice, just like everyone else, but when the others got their choice of meat I got a plateful of sliced red peppers.  That's all.  Sliced red peppers.  Uh,   how about some mushrooms or zuchini or squash or about a million other veggie options.  Fortunately, I'd had enough sake bombs not to get too upset about it!",

They send a coupon for $15 and you have to use it from Sunday to Thursday of your birthday week.  This location definitely looks newer and cleaner than West Edmonton Mall.\n\nSince I usually only eat here once a year, I expected to see changes in the menu.  I noticed mostly how much the prices increased and now they offer more burger and sandwich options.  I ordered my usual choice which went up to $25, St. Louis ribs and 1/4 chicken with baked beans and and baked potato but the coleslaw is also good.  It was good, guess you can't really go wrong.  The sides were just enough, not too generous.\n\nThe waitress was friendly and efficient and wished me a happy birthday but they don't offer any dessert or anything for the birthday.  The restaurant was almost full by the time we left around 6:15 p.m. on a Tuesday so looks like this location is doing well.",

    "text": "I stumbled upon this place many years ago while traveling for work, decided to come back with the gf since we love cheap eats and homestyle cooking.  This time around, the food was not as good as I remembered.  Don't get me wrong, nothing else will be as cheap and filling as this cash only place.  \n\nThe blue ribbon special consists of 2 eggs, 2 pancakes, 2 sausage patties, 2 bacon strips, coffee, and juice.  All that was offered for $4!  How can you ever beat that price?!?  Sadly, the sausage were burnt, the pancakes were undercooked, and the drinks didn't come for over 10 minutes on a slow night.  I ordered the NY strip and western omelette since I was craving meat.  The steak was completely well done even though I asked for medium rare.  This didn't upset me though since you can't expect short order cooks to watch a steak that well.  The problem was how salty the sauce was that came with it, almost made it inedible.  \n\nCome here for cheap breakfast items, which is served 24/7, but don't expect amazing meals.  You will save a lot of money by coming here, that's for sure!",

    "text": "On this most-recent visit to Square 1682, we noticed the menu changed, removing my main draw to the restaurant: the black bean burger. The falafel sandwich that took its place was served on a rather hard bun, rather than traditional pita, which smushed the falafel as you ate and generally overwhelmed the flavors of the tzatziki sauce. (There are plenty of delicious falafel spots in the area that quite simply do it better.)\n\nThe drop in rating comes from the \"Express Lunch\" taking 45 minutes to get to the table (we had 8 people, most of whom ordered the Express Lunch, assuming it would be quicker than the regular menu). 45 minutes is not express and not at all useful when lunching on a time limit. It would've been nice if the server had noted that because Express Lunches are served all 3 courses together, they do not come out as prepared (they're held under a heating lamp till all pieces are ready) and therefore it might be faster for a large group to order off the regular menu. We saw other groups (including some of our colleagues) come and go in the time it took for us to get our food.\n\nI still like the space, as it's quieter than many restaurants, so you can hear one another more easily, but this latest experience took a hit on my recommending it for future meals. A tiny peeve: the \"giant cookie\" was regular-sized (small?) and fine, for oatmeal raisin.",

    "text": "In a direct Bobby Flay vs. Jose Garces match, i.e. comparing Bobby's Burger Palace and Village Whiskey, I'd say BBP clearly wins.\n\nVillage Whiskey's biggest weakness is actually its high price. Taste-wise, my medium-rare burger with goat cheese and egg is comparable to BBP or 500 Degrees. The meat and egg were prepared the way I like it, and the toppings were of high quality, especially the cheese. (Note that the egg yolk is runny! If you don't like that or are afraid of salmonella, let them know.) The only thing I did not like as much was how heavily the hamburger buns were buttered. That was just a little bit too much for my taste, but I know many people who would love the slightly sweet, buttery bun. However, the burger I got was 16 dollars (11 for the burger, 3.50 for the cheese and 1.50 for the egg), which is exactly the price of the burger at Craigie on Main. In case you don't frequent Boston as much, Craigie's is a 'real' gourmet burger where French fries and a small salad are included in the price. At VW, we had to order French fries for 5 dollars on the side, which were delicious and came with a well-spiced ketchup.\n\nI like the atmosphere of the place, and the location which made seating outside more pleasant than at BBP's right on Walnut Street. The service also was excellent (very much unlike BBP). The staff appears professional, they are attentive and fill up your water very regularly.\n\nAll in all, it's a 3.5 - the good burger, atmosphere and service warrant a high rating, but the extraordinarily high price (for what you get) is rather a downer, and I can't give 4 stars to a place where I am unsure whether I'd want to come back. I do like the concept of letting the customer choose their own toppings, which allowed me to choose a combination of toppings you never see but I personally enjoy. On the other hand, the menu of this place is largely uninspired and boring, which in turn is Bobby's Burger Palace's strongest point. If you are in the area, this is probably the highest quality burger + fries you can get - but it comes at a steep price.",

Everyone had a great time. \nSecond party even bigger our hosts rented the whole restaurant for a private party. Again the food was fabulous service was perfect. \nThe problem was a more personal issue. There was a group of us from Bakersfield enjoying the food and service while listening to the band who were taking requests so I got up with a $20.00 dollar bill in hand and made a request for anything from Merle Haggard . Returned to our table and waited and waited.  It became clear the leader of the band preferred more current song choices not old forgotten Country Music legends. \nBeing from Bakersfield it would have meant a lot to us. The band was good but lack of respect to take a tip and dishonor Country legend all in the same night is shameful. One song any song ??",

It was like a BLT and a caprese salad got together and made a very delicious baby. I don't know which part was my favorite: the house made mozzarella, the MAPLE CAJUN BACON slices, the fresh tomatoes, the arugula...it was a glorious combination. I officially want to make a return visit and try more of their menu because the food was delish. However, my one hesitation was the service on that day. Our waiter was very very nice, but we were one of maybe 4-5 tables eating lunch at that time (it was dead in there) and I think we were there for a little under 2 hours from start to finish. I'm all for a leisurely lunch, but seeing as I only ordered a salad and my buddy ordered soup/sandwich, I didn't see why everything took so darn long! We weren't in a big hurry so it wasn't a problem, and I would definitely like to return to try them out at dinner time!",

I enjoyed my glass of Sangiovese, and my husband enjoyed his cocktail. He had a pasta dish with a creamy tomato sauce and sausage, which was good, but tasted like a rather pedestrian Italian pasta dish. Take away the pretty dishes and beautiful table, and I think it was just about as good as any other creamy tomato pasta with sausage dish. My entr\u00e9e was a black bucatini with seafood. The bucatini was good, and sauce was appropriately light and spicy. And the shrimp was pretty well cooked - something that does not happen all the time in Nashville. But the pasta was light on seafood. When lobster is listed on the menu, I want to see and taste the lobster! We also got a half order of the grilled artichoke hearts, which were very well cooked. We shared a dessert, a spicy peanut tart, which was interesting. The restaurant is beautiful, very modern, very hipster Nashville, very dark. The service was great. Really, truly - everyone was very helpful and nice and informed about the menu. So, it really wasn't a terrible meal. But it wasn't one of the better Italian meals I've in Nashville.

    "text": "First things first: Props to what I believe was the manager. She was running all over the place delivering pizzas, picking up glasses, refilling beers, and just being super friendly. As someone who has once worked in a restaurant, I know that's not always the case and I just want to give her props!\n\nOk. So the pizza was really good! We got the thin crust Capone and it was really flavorful. It was unlike most pizza I eat, but I really enjoyed it (think crunchy thin crust, light sauce, light cheese, and non greasy meats). It was light even though it had lots of meat on it, which I thought was amazing. We sat at the bar and the guy next to me said we were making a big mistake by not ordering the Chicago Deep Dish. Looking back I agree with him. Yes, it takes 45 mins to bake, but I will tell you this.. it looked and smelled amazing!! When I saw the waitress walk by with one, I instantly had buyers remorse!!  \n\nThe place is small so seating can take awhile, especially if everyone orders a deep dish (45 min wait just for cooking). We got there at 7 on Friday, I think the wait was 30 mis, but we found seats at the bar and just ate there. I will be back for that deep dish pizza and give an updated review.",

There are the cashier's that will look at you like you are crazy if you try to make conversation with them. Then there are the regulars that are actually nice. I went yesterday and had a cashier that was completely mute. And I loved hearing the bag boy mention how he hoped no one else would get in line so he could get a break. I do have to say the managers are great. The tall bearded wine guy is always helpful. And there is this one short guy that's always gathering grocery carts that will ask if you need help loading groceries. That is always nice!",

More below.\n\nI wasn't very hungry so I decided just to have the hummus with pita appetizer.  Wow -- big portion!  There was easily enough there for two people and it was delicious.  It tasted like there might be some roasted red peppers added in, but I'm not sure.  \n\nNow... my friend ordered the burger and the waiter told him they don't cook it below medium well. WTF?  Seriously?  I don't even remember the excuse but it was really lame.  He ordered it anyway and then wished he hadn't since it had no pink at all.  The fries were good, but very McDonald's-like.\n\nThe desserts were truly delicious.  My friend had a wonderful float made with Abita root beer and I had the bread pudding, which was so light and fluffy -- really good!   \n\nI'll probably come back and update this review because the desserts can probably overcome the stupid burger policy.",

    "text": "It kills me to give only three stars,  but it's really just my fondness of days gone by that keeps me from giving only two. \n\nUpside:  They have great bar food and the best beer selection around.  It's a friendly place and the crowd is always un-stuffy and everyone is having a good time.  They've got a fantastic outdoor area, and the staff is generally pretty pleasant. \n\nThe kickers:  This was my long-time local go-to.  I used to frequent at least a couple times a week hitting happy hour during the week,  and brunch or drinks over the weekend with friends, to the point this place has been known as my \"cheers\".  However,  I'm not sure if it's new management or what,  but over the past year or two,  the service has gone down hill. WAAAAY downhill.   You'll sometimes for for 20\"+ before anyone even approaches you for an order,  and even sitting or standing at the bar,  the bartenders have become pros at standing with their back to the bar and not paying attention or getting your order for at least 5-10\".  The food is still good,  but they used to NAIL IT every time on the burger however you ordered it.  The last several times,  everyone got WELL done,  regardless of order.  \n\nI still go here,  and keep hoping every time that the service quality will return,  but unfortunately the area has exploded so it's always busy,  and I think they just no longer give a rip since they pack the place no matter how crappy service and wait times and food consistency gets. \n\nLuckily,  with the area booming,  there are several other great places now rights across the street and down just a couple blocks. \n\nSummary:  If you're lucky enough to hit this place when it's dead,  don't miss it. If it's slammed,  you're better off across the street at Beer Pale if service matters to you.",

Ice cream was average nothing special. The only saving grace of this experience was our waitress Alexandra who was super attentive and friendly. If it wasn't for her I would give this place 1 star, but because of her I would give this place another chance if I'm ever back in the area again.

    "text": "I reluctantly agreed to meet an old time friend here for drinks at happy hour, as the last time I was there it was unmemorable, but I left there pleased and liquored up.\n\nWe sat at the bar, and was happy to see my tall, attractive, blonde, friendly bartender, who has been there for awhile, ready to serve us.  She was, and always is, quite attentive, cordial and a smooth operator.  \n\nMy martini was filled to the brim, a large glass, very easy to get toasted, this is reason enough to go and sit at the bar.\n\nThey have a happy hour menu which is quite varied, some selections are large enough to be shared, or small enough to eat a few by yourself.  The happy hour prices I thought reasonable.  Anyway, we started with splitting the dynamite shrimp, flavorful with quite a nice kick to the dish.  4 stars for that dish, about a dozen medium sized crispy shrimp in a nice spicy sauce, a great dish to share.  We had the chicken lettuce wraps, a decent 3 star dish, again large enough to split.  To be kind of healthy I ordered some steamed dumplings, the first serving of dumplings (3 dumplings of each) filled with shrimp, (just OK), the second was pork (good), and the third lemon grass chicken (the best of the bunch).  My friend had the ribs.  He said that they were \"not bad\".\n\nI haven't been there in about six months as I got sucked in to the lively bar scene at Redstone next door.   But for a few happy hour apps, large drinks to kick off my buzz, this was a good place to start and then we went to Redstone afterward to scope out the talent.  ;-)",

We were seated right away and the server brought water, coffee and took our orders right away. We waited over 30 mins for breakfast. I got the freebird and came out first before my husband's dish. While it tastes good, it was just potatoes and the spicy sausage gravy was mostly a sauce. There was barely any sausage. My husband got the ny deli omelette that had way too much cheese that it overpowered everything and very little pastrami. Lastly, we were ready to go and our server spent at least 10 mins chatting at another table so I couldn't get our check. I'm not sure if we will return.",

I do remember enjoying it and the margaritas. Anyways, I came here recently on a Thursday night with a group of work people. We had a few issues making reservations. When we called we told them we are a party of about 10 and she said that she would have to double check and get back to us, which she never did. We called back and she said that she would have to check with the General Manager because they have quizzo on Thursday nights. We finally got reservations squared away though! And we got seated at two separate tables next to each other. \n\nMy steak tacos were good, nothing special. The margaritas though... I enjoyed all 4 of them! For dessert I shared some dessert nachos those were pretty tasty. \n\nIf you are going here with a large group definitely make reservations and they may need to split you up.",

(Sponsored post, I believe)  I see a lot of reviews that rave about the cheesy grits, so I had high expectations!  Unfortunately, I was let down.  The price was $12.99. Not outrageous, but I felt there could have been more grits on the plate. The plate was very shallow, but wide.  As for the taste of the grits, I was ready to have awesome, cheesy grits, but to me, they were lacking in cheesy flavor. The shrimp were flavorful and cooked well. The bacon in the dish was excellent, so it wasn't a complete bust, but I would not order it again. My wife had an omelet which she said was very tasty.  If we go back, I would like to try the fried green tomatoes.  That is IF we go back.",

However, I wasn't greeted by an actual person for 10 minutes after finding a seat. \n\nWhen I was finally welcomed the person brought me water and took my order for coffee which she promptly returned with then told me someone would be along shortly to take my order. \n\n...10 more minutes pass before a waiter comes to take my order. Keep in mind that the restaurant was only 50% full when I came in to eat. \n\nThe food came out promptly after ordering as a nice change of pace and was pretty good.

I'll preface by conveying that we did bring most of our concerns to the attention of management and were somewhat compensated.

About 5-10 minutes later she came back and said she didn't pickup our drinks yet but could take our food order (!!)\n\nOnly after we got our food and our table (including kids!) began commenting about the portion size did my wife remind me when we were here last I said I was glad my company was paying!!\n\nI realized I'm getting a bit long winded so...\n* Skip the 'gluten free' bun and go breadless, it's poor tasting and falls apart.\n* the \"pretzels\" are balls of sweet dough that taste like they were previously frozen and defrosted\n* the good news and bad news on the Caesar salad croutons were that they (good) seemed house-made (bad) were badly over-toasted.\n* I thought the $5 fries we received were the $3 fries based on the quantity and the table consensus was they could have been a bit crispier/fresher.\n\nThe manager only took off the $1 gluten free bun upgrade and the \"pretzels.\" He was apologetic and blamed it on being understaffed. \n\nIt didn't seem to be a staffing issue but that everyone from host team to servers were just a bit too laid back about their jobs to help their guests the way a $20+ per guest restaurant should be.",

It costs $20 all you care to eat and all proceeds go to a different organization each month.  Beautiful concept and beautifully executed.\n\nThey make their own gluten free bread.\n\nThey have the brilliant combo of bourbon, candied bacon, and salted caramel ice cream.  Mmmmm......good.\n\nThe not so good:\nThe gluten free bread leaves a lot to be desired.  Very dense, heavy and super crumbly.  I admire the desire to make things in house but there are way better gluten free bread makers in St. Louis that could provide them with buns.\n\nThe burger (ABC burger) was dry and way too overcooked for my taste.  \n\nThe price is waaaay too high in my opinion and I left there feeling nickel and dimed for every little thing.\n\n\nOverall:\nI will be back to try again.

I eat at the taco trucks and the down and dirty corner stores and these are pretty good. The restaurant did right by not pricing themselves out of this market. It is a tad pricey, but i think it is worth it--$3.50 per. 3 = $10.50. Mexican places hover around 3 for $8-9, so the price point isn't too far off. \n\nWhat separates and warrants the additional pricing is the finished product compared to traditional Mexican spots. Instead of just the meat being center attention, there are Buena Onda has additional garnishes that elevate a typical street food. \n\nI ordered:\n-fried mahi mahi\n-carnita\n-carne\n\nall were pretty good but the winner by a mile was the mahi mahi. I used the red hot sauce (in the jar, not bottle), so i can't review the green one. The red sauce was really nice, added more flavors to the already flavorful tacos.\n\nHere were the misses...\n\n1. my cousin and i ordered 4 tacos. Cashier rang up 3. \n2. we ordered 2 modelos. Cashier rang up 2 modelos AND 1 CORONA\n3. we showed him the \"rewards\" program to get discount. Cashier never gave discount. \n\nWhen we paid, i was wondering why it was so high (expecting the discount) and why we got a Corona? Our order was not complex...we did not ask questions. Just put order and paid. I defended the cashier saying \"they just opened, must be oversight\". BUT, my cousin believes he was high while on the job. OH well. \n\nALso, i'm not sure how their system is setup because all 3 tacos came out on one tray. What if two people share 3 tacos like i did? I had to ask for another tray, which wasn't a problem, but inconvenient considering we ordered \"separately\" but paid all together.",

The mac and cheese was bland too but the cucumber tomato salad was good. My fiance loved his food though but he's from New Jersey, I'm from the South so I know southern food.

It's just not great food by any means and for anyone else who knows southern food, you will probably be disappointed too unless you like mediocre stuff.

    "text": "Conceptually awesome! My wife and I popped in early Friday evening for our first visit. The environment left us feeling as though we were at a  beach bar & restaurant. We tried two appetizers: Grilled Shrimp and Smoked Fish Spread. Both were well prepared and delicious. For entrees, Emily had the grilled snapper tacos and I had the gag grouper dinner. Both meals were delicious! The issues the exist can easily be corrected. It is summer and this is an outdoor venue. You order your food at a hut located behind the bar. However, you have to stand in the HOT sun while ordering! A canopy needs to be installed. There is no pricing listed anywhere so you order and then get surprised by what you are asked to pay. What we ordered was well worth what we paid but it would be nice to know what you are spending before you order. The only menu is a series of high-end cocktails all of which sound delicious. However, the bartenders are not adept and creating these wonderful concoctions. So the delivery is not as great as the written word. Suggestion, cocktail napkins or coasters (they won't blow away) and ice. Alcohol melts the ice so load the glass up because the Florida summer heat melts the ice also. The plastic wear is fine and works well enough but the little piece of paper in the package is not sufficient to be called a napkin. Serve and extra \"real\" napkin with the utensils. One thing for sure we will be back but at this price point, a few additional steps need to be taken by management and crew. PS: Your \"rocking\" your idea Morgan - Smile and look less stressed (even if you are). Cheers,",

    "text": "A place just for Mac and Cheese? Yes pl(ch)eeeeseee!  hearing about this place and I automatically knew I had to come and try it out. I really like the food! You get to build your own or select from the premade menu items! Cheesy? meaty options?satisfying?\n\nthe environment is great. The tables face towards the windows so u can look outside. The shop itself is pretty small so there aren't many tables, but that's alright. \n\nFood comes quick and price for Mac and cheese is alright I guess. I think it's a bit much for how much you get (pretty small) and it's not like it's the BEST Mac I've ever tasted though. I was expecting a bit more since this place specializes in Mac and cheese afterall. Still give this place a try though! It's still very delicious",

Then we order our food. Took a long time for salads & the biscuits our main meal came out first it was bought out by someone else & not waiter by time we found our waiter he said he thought the girl bought out our salads & biscuits. He said he'll take care of it that took a minute to come out as well. We ate our main meal then salad & biscuits. Yeah it's all going in the same place but it's certain order we wanted to eat our food & this first time I had to wait a while on simple service at least bring out the biscuits right at the beginning",

    "text": "Meun Fan Thai took over the old Cafe International spot and gave it a face lift and painted it a fresh minty green to match their Mesa location.  For Thai food, there are only two choices in Goleta.  My favorite is still Your Choice on State, but Meun Fan was passable if I don't feel like driving to Santa Barbara.  We started with a bunch of tiny fried spring rolls.  I wasn't a fan of them, too much wrapper and the filling was dry.  The pineapple coconut curry was also mediocre.  While the sauce was full of coconut flavor, I wish the meat was wok fried before hand instead of being directly boiled in the sauce.  The tofu pad see ew was tasty and there was visible caramelization from the wok without being too oily.  Overall, I am willing to give it another chance.",

(Although I'm not new to the area) I wanted to opt for the gluten free but that apparently was not part of the deal. So I chose Hawaiian and my boy chose BLT. We did half and half on a large pizza, The Hawaiian was o-k. I wasn't wowed. I didn't even try the BLT which just looked awful to me with an overload of balsamic glaze. (Please see pic) The bread sticks were decent. Just seemed like the pizza crust with cheese. Overall my experience was o-k or decent. I will be back to try the gluten free as I am trying TRYING! to not eat wheat!",

However,  other than diners this is a great breakfast choice in the area. \n\nYou may need to wait 10-15 minutes for a table on Saturday and Sunday.  There is outdoor seating available for when the weather is nice. \n\nThe coffee menu is amazing.  This is the only restaurant that I know of (other than coffee houses) that brings a French press to your table.  Variety of beans including Costa Rican,  Hawaiian,  and Jamaican.  Gourmet iced coffee with coffee iced cubes- hell yes! Plus refills free to go. \n\nThe menu is simple focusing on eggs, hot cakes,  and sandwiches.  Nothing has totally blown me away but the food is good and fresh. Random sidenote obsessed with the red pepper soup.\n\nDefinitely one of my to go to breakfast spots in south Jersey - recommend.",

I have to say I was disappointed with my entree  on this visit.\n\nI had the grilled Mahi Mahi, usually my fave fish. The Mahi had no flavor, was very bland, and a sort of \"fishy taste.\" The side of Capellini pasta was equally disappointing. The Marinara sauce tasted like pure tomato sauce out of the can. \n\nThe other entrees at the table were Veal Montalbano and chicken Pontchartrain. The guests liked their entrees, so maybe I chose the wrong dish, but I don't think I will be back for awhile.",

I'd say one could serve at least two people!\n\nI've sampled:\n\nThe St. Louis ($7.49) -- Parmesan tomato sauce, pepperoni, Italian sausage, provel and Mozzarella cheeses on a tomato-basil tortilla.\n\nThe Texas ($7.49) -- Home-made smoky sweet barbeque sauce, red onions, grilled chicken, thick-cut bacon, cheddar and monterey jack cheeses on a flour tortilla.\n\nThe Italian ($7.49) --  Parmesan tomato sauce, red onions, red and green peppers, provel and Mozzarella cheeses on a tomato-basil tortilla.\n\nThe Parma ($7.49) -- Parmesan tomato sauce, grilled chicken, provel and Mozzarella cheeses on a flour tortilla.\n\nThe Bleachers 'Chos ($6.99) are really the king!

    "text": "Craving some saucy meat over rice led me to my first visit here. I browse the menu and see roasted duck on the lunch special for about 5 bucks! My wife orders that. An egg roll and choice of soup is included. The hot and sour soup was not so hot and sour, but for the price of the lunch special, it was good enough. This is probably one of the better meals I've tasted for around five dollars. Forget the foot long!\n\nI order the shrimp with scrambled eggs \"Chinese\" style. This style is  saucy as the eggs are whipped and cooked in gravy. It needed scallions and a touch of hot chili sauce. They didn't have the chili oil at the table. Maybe you have to request it. I did, however, ask for a little hot mustard on the side. Mixed with a touch of soy, I found the flavor I was looking for. The \"American\" style is fried like an omellete. \n\nWith 2 sodas, tax and tip, it was a decent roasted duck and shrimp 20 dollar meal for 2. \n\nI look forward to trying their dim sum.",

    "text": "This review is based off of one visit as I don't think I will be returning anytime soon. \n\nI was attending a Christmas get together at Besito with a large group of about 16. I ordered a \"frozen\" margarita. It was the only frozen margarita on the menu and was pomegranate. It was okay, but a little off for my tastes. It was also melted and no longer frozen within a few minutes of it arriving. I only finished about half of it. We ordered during happy hour when the margarita is supposed to be $5 instead of the usual $9. We had to ask for the happy hour price, but more on that in a moment. \n\nThree of us decided to split a queso fundito. This is one of my favorite Mexican Appetizers and I order it regularly at traditional Mexican restaurants. While the queso fundito was still good at Besito, it was disappointing to someone that has had a traditional version. It is supposed to be essentially a fondue type pot of melted cheese with some chorizo and served with tortillas. Besito cheapened theirs by adding piles of onions and peppers. It was also served in a very shallow square skillet. When split three ways (and with the 2-3 others in the room that tried it), it left very little queso fundito. The flavor was good. However, with the added thick peppers and onions and the small quantity, I would not order again. \n\nI was able to try the chips, salsa and table side guacamole also. I will say that this is probably the best guacamole that I have ever tried. I loved the flavor and the thick chunks of avocado. The salsa and guac were my favorite things at Besito. However, I can't see myself paying $10 for guac on a return visit. That is just way too much for guacamole in my opinion. \n\nFor my meal, I ordered the Chile Rellenos Con Hongos. I order Rellenos anytime I see them on the menu since they are one of my favorite things. Most restaurants serve them with some rice and beans or some sort of side. Let's face it...stuffed relleno peppers are not the most filling thing in the world. My Rellenos did not come with a side. The came with sauce and nothing else for a whopping $18. I almost didn't order them when I saw the price, but everything else on the menu was that price or higher. The Rellenos had good flavor for the first bite...or maybe two. However, a few bites in I was over it. They are stuffed in goat cheese and there are globs of goat cheese on the outside. So much freaking goat cheese. I like the stuff, but it was overboard. That wasn't the worst part though, it was the pine nuts. There seemed to be a whole bag of the things mixed into my small plate. I would never order this again. \n\nOur service was great until it came time for the checks. Our waitress did not give us happy hour prices for the margaritas we ordered before happy hour was up. She also messed up dividing our appetizer between the three checks. However, the worst was that we handed the checks to them with our cards in each individual envelope. When they returned, my card was with my friends check (and had been charged) and my check was missing. WTH? It ended up taking us about 45 minutes to get our checks, get them corrected, get them corrected again and get out of there. My poor husband had dropped me off and was waiting outside this whole time since I thought I was almost done when I received the check. Uggg. \n\nI don't think I will be back to Besito anytime soon. If I do, it will be for happy hour only. It is too rich and not on par enough for this cheap, but picky girl.",

I like to bring people from out of town because they get good food and get to try beer they wouldn't otherwise. Parking is tricky though.\n\nDon't come on a Sunday night though. I think it's just because no one was around, but the cheese in the cheeseburger was frozen solid. Not pleasant. Otherwise, the beer was good and so was the food.\n\nPros: good beer, good food, interesting place to see\nCons: Parking can be annoying, Sunday night service/food is the opposite of busier times.",

    "text": "We invited\u200b friends to dinner, when we selected\u200b Saki they were hesitant as they had been there before; love the food but had bad service.\n\nWe arrived about 7 pm\u200b on a Friday night and the place was nearly full with just a few tables left. We were seated immediately at a table for four. The tables are a bit close, with the angle of our table I was practically sitting in the next table, we actually joked with them about it.\n\nOur server was pretty amazing, she got drinks, kept them refilled and took our first course orders, she kept checking back and never made us feel rushed.\n\nMy husband and I started off sharing\u200b a number of appetizers -we started with crab rangoon, gyoza, shrimp shumai and spring rolls. The food came up pretty quickly considering how full the restaurant was. \n\nThe spring\u200b rolls were light and crisp, the crab rangoon pretty standard, the shrimp shumai was\u200b moist\u200b but the flavor was really blah. The gyoza was HORRIBLE, they were hard, dry and not any better than we'd buy in any supermarket\u200b.\n\nThe biggest challenge I have is with the food runners, they have several young guys who seem to speak very little English\u200b. They kind of grunt when they come to the table and food is shoved in front of you, whether there is any room or not. \n\nThe portions are relatively small, I completely understand that they will bring you as much as you need. But, the plates they use are HUGE for three small pieces of shumai and the guys running food spill all of\u200b the sauces out of the wells in the dishes.\n\nFor my second round,\u200b I had the Hot and Sour Soup - it was very good, not to think\u200b or heavy, nicely\u200b spiced with lots of tofu and vegetables.\n\nThe Seaweed Salad was chilled, a few kinds of seaweed, nice flavor.\n\nThe Chicken Tempura was more\u200b tonkatsu, breaded and fried crisp\u200b, moist and crunchy but not a tempura batter.\n\nI finished up with a Philadelphia and a Spicy Tuna maki roll as well as some sashimi - tuna, salmon\u200b, \u200b and escolar\u200b. All three were well chilled, thinly sliced and very fresh. The salmon was super buttery.\n\nThe food was for the most part very well prepared, the service won our friends over and its a great value for the Endless Dinner option.",

    "text": "While there's better BBQ to be had in the Bay Area, this joint was nearby and is in a great location for people watching and walking around Main street in Safety Harbor. It works in a pinch if you're in the mood for pork! \n\nMy boyfriend and I ordered combos, both including pulled pork and spare ribs. While the ribs were smoked and tasty, they were a little tough compared to what we're normally used to. My boyfriend happened to like the pulled pork, but I felt that I could've made better at home. It was bland and seemed like it didn't have any seasoning at all. \n\nThe sides don't offer too much to chose from. There is a variety of \"dressing-\" covered starches, like potato and macaroni salads, but the only worthwhile side we tried was the cornbread pudding. I highly recommend it if you find yourself here. It's more of a bread than pudding and is at a sweetness level that can be enjoyed as a side instead of dessert. \n\nNow for the most important part, the sauces! One was a vinegar based spicy concoction that we mostly stayed away from and there was another \"mango\" flavored one that barely tasted like the fruit. The best is their sweet sauce, which is thick and similar to Sweet Baby Rays but with a little extra kick. It was great! \n\nThe service, location and pretty much everything else was pretty good, but unfortunately, we felt the BBQ could've been better and that there could've been more side selections like french fries or mac'n'cheese.",

Their food is overpriced compared to other \"Healthy food\" places. Even With the sales it is sometimes not even worth it. The produce also gets old quickly and I can find the same items they carry here at publix for the same or even less. I do browse the sale options and I come sometimes for that after I compare them to other stores. \n\nThe salad bar/ prepared meals are meh. Actually disappointing. I always end up driving to Whole Foods :-/ Every time I try to do my grocery shopping here I always end up having to go to other stores to find what I need for the week. I can't say that I have been able to come here and fully shop for the week and feel like I got the best deal. \n\nThe only time I come here is for specific items like the enlightened ice creams because they carry almost all of the flavors. I don't hate it but it's just not the first place I would come to or think to do my full grocery shopping. The staff is really nice though.\n\nI wanted to like this place more but it just isn't doing it for me!!",

The effort on the part of the owners is top notch--love how the order process follows you to the table so any follow up dishes you might want don't require waiting in the front line again. However, the culinary execution failed somehow, or at least it fell strangely flat. While all the food we had (beef souvlaki, lamb pita, and grilled octopus) was decent, it definitely wasn't transcendent. It was just food. Also, the ubiquitous french fries were only semi-addictive as were a  little dry. \n\nWhile this is maybe the best Greek food in Nashville, that in itself doesn't warrant 5 stars. What we concluded after eating all the food was, while Greko was \"okay\" there was nothing that we had that would draw us back.",

We brought a bottle of tequila for margaritas and I am almost certain the waitress stole a nice amount of it, (the bottle was returned with 1/6th left and we only had two pitchers) and the two waitresses were acting drunk when we left.

    "text": "As a BIG fan of Bailey's Chocolate Bar (their tiramisu martini is my favorite drink ever!), I really really wanted to love this place too, but I just didn't.  I had a cheeseburger, fries with their cheese sauce, and a peanut butter milkshake.  The burger was okay, and I probably would've liked it better had I not put their homemade ketchup on it before tasting it.  I'm not sure what is up with their ketchup, but I just didn't really care for it.  Too sweet, perhaps?  It just didn't taste quite right to me. The fries were good, as was their cheese sauce.  And the peanut butter shake was amazing.  I did try some of my husband's food and I guess that's partially why I only am giving Bailey's Range 3 stars. He ordered honey mustard sauce with his fries, and there was nothing \"honey\" flavored about it; it just tasted like spicy mustard to me, which neither of us particularly care for.  I won't even get started on the bacon milkshake he ordered and didn't care for, because that's his own fault for ordering something so strange.  In short, I wasn't all that impressed.  If I ever go again, maybe I'll stick with the dessert and skip the food -- either that, or bring my own condiments!",

The cases are lined with treats that are as wonderful to look at as they are to eat. I got two eclairs and two cookies; after the friendly cashier rang up my total I was a bit taken back. This is definitely a special occasion/bad day kind of bakery. The treats are obviously made with a large amount of attention to detail but this place is definitely not pocketbook friendly!\n\n\n\nWent to the Cake Bake Shop again today for a piece of coconut cream pie. Paid $9.80 for one piece of pie. I think the owner should reevaluate the amount of embellishments (gift bags, fancy napkins,pink forks) and the amount of staff members standing around to lower the costs. The pie was just ok.\n\n\nEverything is covered in glitter now...not sure how I feel about this.",

There is a small bar and weird mosh-pit esque dancefloor upstairs, but that bar is cash only. Great selection of draft beers. The biggest drawback is that if all the seats at the bar are full, there's not really much room to stand unless you sit in the dining area, but that definitely has a different vibe. I heard the food is really good do I will probably be back to check that out.",

It tries to be upscale tavern food, but that type of food nearly always fails. They are strict about no substitutions which is annoying. They did have a good beer selection with some I've never heard of which is always good. I'm not sure I'd go here for the food, though the Groupon made it better. Also kind of slow service and kind of cramped since the bar crowd stated filling up the restaurant area. I would go for the beer selection.",

    "text": "Four stars for decor and craft beer selection. Two stars for food. This place does shine like a diamond in the rough. I'm not too familiar with Philly, but the bar flanked parts of Chinatown and seemed to be in a part of town that was a bit rough-around-the -edges, so finding this cool spot in such a unlikely locale made it ever more of a sweet find. From the vintage sign outside to the wrought iron mustang carved enclosures that meet you at the front entrance, a subtlely hip James Dean appeal imbued the Prohibition.  The vibe, beer, and service did not disappoint, so I expected their grub to live up. I was excited to see their pickle plate as an app and ordered it on a whim. Luscious looking carrots and cocktail onions and green beans came out on an equally verdant and zesty looking bed of fresh lettuce, but after my second bite I realized that looks can be deceiving. Let's just say this app tasted more like a vinegar plate than a pickled veg plate.  The veggie sandwich tasted overly seasoned and a few bites in, I couldn't even finish it.  I almost would have rather they served a Boca Burger and least gotten something somewhat tasty for my money. And then a quarter of the way through our sandwich, a slightly off cook (the head cook?) came out from the kitchen and kept offering the bartenders food, only to be turned down. And they seemed annoyed by her persistence. Weird. The whole situation was odd and made me wish I had only stopped at the Prohibition for a drink and gone somewhere else for food.",

From all day breakfast options to sandwiches, burgers, pasta, seafood, meat entrees and dessert, there's something for everyone on the menu. However, with a large selection quantity comes limited quality. I ordered the buffalo chicken wrap and had to pull out almost all of my chicken because it looked and tasted suspicious. My sister ordered the French dip and found the meat to be really dry. One item I did like was the chili. The bowl portion is served in a ceramic platter and is almost large enough to be a full meal. The price range for sandwiches is around $9-$13 while the entrees are closer to $15 and seafood is over $20. I can't imagine their seafood being fresh though so the price seems a bit high. The restaurant opens at 6 am each day so I feel as if it's better as a casual breakfast spot than one I would go to for lunch or dinner.",

    "text": "I purchased a Groupon for a night stay here in a Jr. Suite & the room was 50% off & ran $200 with the discount.  I was already heading to TN to visit some family so my mom & I decided to use the Groupon the night before I left so we'd be close to the airport.  We had both been to the hotel in the past (prior to the flood) and thought it was so gorgeous & we couldn't wait to actually stay here & see what the room would look like.  According to their website we were in for a real treat in our room but when we arrived that wasn't the case at all.  \n\nFirst off, their parking has gone up & is now $18 per night to park in a lot that doesn't shuttle you & your luggage to the main hotel, you have to walk.  If you choose to valet the cost is $24 per night which I have a huge issue with...the parking is outside in their own lot, this is not a major city like NYC where parking is limited so I feel that charging people to park & walk is a bit ridiculous, I can see charging $5/10 for valet but charging me to park my own car & shlep my own bags is a slap in the face especially considering the room rates.  How are locals supposed to be patrons to the businesses inside if they have to pay that much just to park?  \n\nThe hotel itself if gorgeous but the room was pretty boring...it was a large single room with a 4 person dining table & 2 armchairs, it was not at all what was explained on their website which indicated \"Our suites include a moderate-size living room and optional connecting bedrooms with endless possibilities for entertaining or for small corporate meetings\".  This led me to believe that we wouldn't be sleeping in the moderate sized living room & have no bedroom at all.  At no time during booking or check in was I asked how many beds I wanted & since I thought our suite had bedroom(s) I didn't ask & when we got to the room we had 1 king.  I called down to the front desk first to ask why we were put in a standard room & why it only had 1 bed & I was told \"our Jr. suite is just 1 large room & you should have specified when asked how many beds you wanted\" I replied \"I was never asked during booking or check in what I wanted\" I was then told \"well, if you want to change to 2 beds I can transfer you to the front desk & you can see if they have anything available\" and I said \"no, I don't want the hassle I guess we can just share the bed\" and was told \"OK, sorry you are disappointed\".  The guest services person didn't offer to find out the 2 bed availability for me, she didn't offer to move us to a garden view room (which is still cheaper at its standard rate than the discounted rate we paid for the suite) or offer any other solutions either & I was really disappointed with that.\n\nOnce we got over the disappointment of our room we got dressed & hit the hotel to shop, eat, cocktail & check out the murals & water shows.  First off we tried to find the water show & weren't having any luck so we proceeded to shop & asked the woman working in one of the stores where we could find them & she said \"oh, they aren't running tonight\" so that was disappointing but we moved on to exploring the murals when we were then asked by a lovely gentleman to leave because of an event that was going on behind the closed doors of the area we were in.  After a couple hours of being at the hotel we were 0 for 4 so we decided to start drinking...we hit up Fuse & each had 1 drink & our bill was $19 so we moved on to dinner at Jack Daniels which was so good & reasonable priced.  I think our total bill was under $40 & we didn't have any drinks but we did have leftovers!!  After dinner there was nothing left to do so we went back to the room for some shut eye which was great until we got the luxury of listening to our neighbors have sex.  After all of that I took an Ambien & slept really well until about  7 am when I could hear people talking in the hallway & room doors closing one after the other.  My mom said she slept for s**t because of all of the noise & it was a shame too because the bed was so comfortable.  \n\nI'm sure that if everything we wanted to see & do would have been available to us this wouldn't have seemed like such a let down & the boring room wouldn't have been that big of a deal but considering that we weren't able to do anything that was on our list I would be hesitant to stay here again unless we had an atrium room so we could at least sit on the balcony & people watch.  \n\nDon't get me wrong, the lush greenery & the beautiful architecture as well as the shopping & food are all amazing but as a guest I left feeling pretty let down.",

    "text": "I hit the drive-thru at this White Castle last night with my aunt on our way home from Carmel. I was starving and it hit the spot. \n\nOur order was taken right away and in a friendly manner. The food seemed to take several minutes, but was hot and fresh and worth the wait. It was my first time trying the new veggie sliders. They aren't THE best veggie burgers I have ever had, and are quite high in calories from what I hear, but were good. I appreciate that White Castle started offering these for the cravers that no longer do meat.\n\nThe only small disappointment was that when we were asked if we wanted sauce, what kind of sauce I do not know, I requested mustard on my sliders and that was left off. There also were no napkins or salt in the bag. It was hard to tell my veggie slider from my aunt's fish sandwich digging in the bag in the car. The large portions on our medium fries made up for it though as well as being a quick and convenient place for someone like me to grab a meal on the run that contained some much needed protein.\n\nService was friendly and the restaurant seemed clean. It appears to be either a newer store or a very well-kept one. Bonus was seeing one of the Indy chicken limos down the road.\n\nUpdating to say, while good tasting, the food I had did not sit quite right with me.  It was possibly that I'm not used to greasy combined with being out of sorts lately. Tastes good, but I may need antacid or something next time.",

    "text": "This is my usual, but only because my neighborhood has NO grocery store, even though it's been 5 1/2 years since Katrina... \n\nAnyway, the parking lot is a freaking death trap. People park in the fire lanes and clog up the aisles with their poor parking. A lot of this probably has to do with the fact that this place is the only grocery store for A LOT of people. The produce is unreliable, except they have a board by the front door that lists the local produce, which I LOVE, and use to buy as locally as possible. All other Rouse's don't have this, but they should. A few of the gentlemen that work in produce are helpful in answering questions about when items will return or where they are, etc. \n\nThe bakery grinds out new fresh bread every day, and most of it is really tasty. Warning, though, they don't list the nutritional information on the packages, so you might get something you don't want in your tummy..\n\nThey've recently added a \"natural\" section, which has organic and all natural food/beauty products. This makes me very happy, but I usually buy the Rouse's brand organic canned goods because they are cheaper. \n\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, this place serves as the sole provider of groceries to a lot of people. What that means to you is that on busy times (at like, 6 pm, or right before saints games..), it is so busy that you can't go in an aisle without smashing into someone, and it gets really frustrating. I try to go on \"off\" times and pray for the day when they re-open the store on Elysian Fields.",

    "text": "I've frequented this place with a friend several times but no matter how many times I come here, I always forget to bring cash. It is an extra mile to venture outside of this area to a bank to get some cash and come all of the way back. It's an established place where New Orleanians come for wings, Cajun fries, and the famous ghetto punch! It's the most delicious punch I've ever had: not too sweet, not bitter, and a natural blend of flavors for the perfect punch.\n\nAfter getting your cash, you would need to park under the bridge and walk across the street. Be careful and pay attention to the light. Keep your car locked and keep an eye out. At this locations there is no place to sit and eat, and it's not really comfortable to order and wait. You're standing the entire time, outside a pickup window; you can imagine how packed it may get if it rains or gets really cold outside. \n\nPersonally, l think the wings are rather dry: they could use some juice or some oil to keep them juicy. The fries I love, but not more than I love the punch! Get a large if you can; you won't regret it. It's a little bit of a hassle, this place; Yet and still, the food is enough for customers to keep coming back.",

    "text": "I consider myself a connoisseur of both Mexican food and hot dogs, so I can't believe it took me this long to stop by BK. I ordered a cabeza taco, small al pastor caramelo, and sonoran hot dog. The ambiance of this place is a little weird, but it was nice to have plenty of TVs showing college football. \n\nThe cabeza was delicious, rich, and fatty, and I wish I had ordered one more. The caramelo (basically a 2-tortilla quesadilla with meat) was good as well, even though they gave me carne asada instead of al pastor. The hot dog was fine, but it didn't blow me away like some others I've had around town. The serve-yourself salsa/condiment bar is great: pickled onions, several types of red and green salsas, cabbage, limes, etc.\n\nPrices here are pretty reasonable, but be advised that caramelo/taco portions are kind of small. If you're a big dude like me, you're gonna have to get about 3 tacos or a large caramelo. Overall, a tasty and filling place that I will certainly come back to.",

    "text": "So, I had a craving for a slinger and used Yelp to help find a local place to get one, leading me to George Rivolo's Diner. I walked in and was amazed at how small the place was. I counted around 15 seats total. The seats were a bit worn down and could have definitely used some cushions (I actually did hurt my butt sitting down on those things). I browsed through the menu, found my singer (and was disappointed at the up charge to have meat in it). So I watched as the lady behind the counter made my food.\n\nWhile waiting I have to point out how immaculately clean the kitchen was. Having worked in several restaurants I know how much work it takes to keep a kitchen as spotless as this place was and I have to say that alone impressed me and told me that the people who own this place care. \n\nOnce I got my food I figured, \"yep... that's a slinger\". I was slightly disappointed that there wasn't more chili on it, and I felt that the chili and burger meat could have done with some seasoning. However that being said, it was okay for diner food. Not something I'd go out of my way for, but not something I'd avoid either. If the owner took the time to add a bit more flavor to the food this would be a place worth visiting regularly for me. As it stands though, i can't really give high recommendation for this place unless you are already in the neighborhood and craving some diner food.",

    "text": "I had a large party reservation (10 people) for 8:30 on a Friday night. I made the reservation a week in advance and was told it was no problem. We didn't get seated until 9:15. The hostess kept telling us that they were waiting to get tables together, I'm not sure what she meant by that but it was annoying to have 10 people standing around waiting for a table for 45 minutes. \n\nWe waited at the bar and had some margaritas. The first one we tried, the natural one, tasted watered down. The bartender then informed us it had water in it. Who puts water in a margarita? We tried the classic next, it was better but not great. The ingredients listed next to the margaritas on the menu are not accurate so be sure to ask the bartender exactly what's in each one. \n\nOnce we were seated our waiter was extremely nice and did a great job with such a large party! We had 3 orders of the table side guacamole and they were delicious. For dinner, most of us orders appetizer portions because we had filled up on the guac and all the free chips and salsa. My tacos were okay, they came on corn tortillas and I should have asked for flour ones but the carne asada was delicious. I asked for no cilantro but it was on there. I didn't want to send it back because it was already 10:30 and I was just so hungry at that point.\n\nNot sure I'll be back, there are a lot better Mexican places in Tampa but you have to try everything at least once!",

I see the word buffet and told him that I don't think it is a good idea.  Buffet never impressed me.  When I saw that the place served Taiwanese off the menu, I was still hesitant about eating here, but was more intrigued by trying out Taiwanese.\n\nWe walked into the place and it looked like a typical Asian restaurant.  The decor was horrible.  It least it was clean.  The lady greeted us warmly.  When I told her that I wanted to try Taiwanese food, she appeared very hesitant about serving it.  I pushed and pushed for her to tell me what she offers.  After asking me how I knew she offered Taiwanese food, she explained that the restaurant is a pizza and salad buffet and the only reason why she offer it is because the Taiwanese students begged her.  I wanted to order the beef noodle soup and the fried pork chop dish.  She discourage because it is a lot of food.  I settle for the beef soup.\n\nThe bowl came out and it looked like Vietnamese oxtail soup.  The broth is so dark it is almost a black color.  It smelled very similar to pho.  The broth wasn't hot enough for my liking but it didn't take away from the soup.  The broth had hints of star anise and cloves.  This soup is served with a flour based noodle and pickled mustard leaves.\n\nI will have to come back for the pork chop and braised pork and rice.",

Well, it was a Tuesday night and there were only about 4 other patrons there; we had the whole back room to ourselves.  We ordered quite a bit for two.  We started with scallion pancakes, meh i've had better.  It was nothing special.  The guy had the spicy beef noodle soup, beef was braised as well.  The broth was delicious and spiciness level was a 5.  When he asked the waiter if the size was comparable to pho the waiter did not have a clue to what pho was.  You work in an asian resto my dude!  Granted this is not a viet joint, but you should be well rounded about asian cuisine overall.  Anyway, the dan dan noodle is a staple when dining at Han's, the spiciness level was a 6 and they accommodated me by not adding meat to it.  I also ordered the spicy cucumber, spiciness level was a 6.  After one helping i was over it.  The garlic overpowered the rest of the flavosr as i kept munching on it.  My eyes locked in on the salt and pepper shrimp entree so i had to order it.  I love this dish.  The minced pepper and onion just heightens the flavor of the shrimp.  Shame that it was on the pricey side, $19.95.  I think there were only about 10 pieces of shrimps.  The guy had a chicken entree that he liked, nothing special.  We ended up having leftovers cause we wanted to try different things.  I think next time i'll just stick to the lunch menu or take out.",

I wasn't disappointed in the taste of food, what I had (broth bowl and half a turkey sandwich) was really good, but holy smokes was it expensive!!!! For what my husband and I got (he got chicken noodle soup and a sandwich) it was a little over $30!! I feel for this price the portions should be bigger than what they were. Good food yes but pretty pricy for what you get.",

Their menu is very large. We were looking it over and trying to decide on what to order when the waitress delivered an order of onion rings to the table beside us. YUM! We ordered those right away! They arrived fairly quickly and were delicious! The rings are made from \"real\" onions and have probably never seen a freezer. We probably should have just stopped there, but ordered lunch. I had the Onion Jam burger with tater tots. The burger was OK -- not great and not worth ordering again. The tater tots were nasty (how do you mess up frozen tater tots??). Others in the group had a pasta dish (again, just OK) and a turkey wrap with fries. I think she enjoyed the wrap, but the fries were mediocre. Service was good even though the place was crowded. Several tables near us had small children. Most of the kids were well behaved, but, some weren't. Folks, if you ignore your misbehaving child, don't be surprised at the nasty looks you get. Take them to McDonald's until they learn how to behave or you learn how to raise children!",

Also a general comment, I went with someone who is full on gluten free (celiac) figuring with their amount of veg friendly they would also be GF friendly.

Tunes you know, tunes that sound like the hot sisters of tunes you know, tunes that take you back to when you played doctor with a Fisher Price stethoscope--yeah, music like that. I definitely did my fair share of Shazaaming and \"I gotta go back and listen to that album\"-ing.\n\nThe food itself was pretty mediocre. The boy and I did a weekend-long food tour of Philly and this was stop #65 or so, so we weren't extremely hungry coming in.\n\nWe came for the duckfat fries. But, well, they looked and tasted like normal fat fries except possibly on the drier side. The cheddar sauce helped a lot but I love french fries and believe good fries taste good without condiments of any kind, so the cheddar sauce wasn't too comforting to my fry-loving soul. We then split the chicken-fried steak. Holy oversalted batter, Batman! Waayyyy too much salty batter, about 0.23g of actual chicken. The gravy was okay but nothing remarkable and the biscuits were tender but too dense.\n\nI did love my cocktail, though. Got the Philadelphia Fish House Punch and it was a good, strong, sweet cocktail. Between that and the frat boy/bachelor party table next to us, I had a pretty good time here but definitely won't be coming back next time I'm in the city of brotherly love.",

It was cooked just how I asked (medium), but there wasn't a whole lot of guac on it, so I asked for a side, so I was happy! The garlic Parmesan  fries were not as good as I had expected. Not a lot of garlic or parm throughout the fries. Upon our second go-around of fries, the garlic and parm seemed more generous. I think I can do better if I try something on my own at home! I did enjoy some sweet potato fries and whatever it is that they serve it with, I need to find me some for home. It was a spicy type of ketchup dip,but ran more on the jelly/jam side.\n\nService was decent. At first our waitress was very present, but then when we needed drink refills (and more fries), she was nowhere to be seen. Otherwise she was pleasant and thought to bring us more napkins before we had asked. \n\nThe wait was about 25 minutes, but there were 5 of us and we asked for a table. Loud place, but not bothersome. I think I'll stick to Five Guys for my burger fix (but I would still come back here, though!)",

I don't live in Tucson but my girlfriend does and I only get to see her about 2 nights every couple months so its a special occasion when I do make it up to Tucson. Wanting to take her somewhere nice we booked Maynards. \n\nArriving we had a hard time trying to find parking which wasn't the restaurants fault as downtown Tucson is undergoing some major improvements. Once we got inside the hostess was nice. We sat down and it took awhile for our waiter to make his way to us. \n\nWe both were really excited and hungry for a good meal, the bread was extremely slow coming out and was rock hard, the service was not the best, our waiter was slow and didn't seem very busy even though it was Friday night. \n\nI ordered \"The Burger\" and my girlfriend had the Filet Mignon. The food made it out decently timed, but I was unhappy when I took a bite into my burger I ordered it Medium and it was burnt to the crisp, way past over done and had no color, just burnt black. For a 20 dollar burger it was not what I expected had no flavor what-so-ever. But the bacon I bought for an extra 2.00 on the burger was really good so that's a positive. \n\nNow for the positives, the Bacon was really good, the size of the burger was perfect. And the French fries on the side were amazing. \n\nMy girlfriend loved her steak and I took a bite and it was really good so I was happy with her meal and she loved my fries as well.\n\nOverall it wasn't that bad of an experience and I would dine there again, my rating is so low due to the burger not being cooked very good, might of been the waiters fault or the chief just wasn't feeling on his burger game that night. If we were to go again and I am sure we will I would definitely not be getting the burger and focus on there steak which was really good.",

Cons: very small portions for an average guy (might be ok for females). Ordered a bowl with protein and it comes with very little protein.

Mufaletta was just okay, cold in the middle. Boiled shrimp were just right. Loved their broiled Oysters Desire dish. \n\nBreakfast next day: wonderful waitress Ruthie took great care of us and picked up on our impaired state from the previous night's revels. Coffee and Bloody Mary's came quickly. She even made up a little fruit bowl for us to take back to one of the slackers in our party. At her urging I went for the breakfast Jambalaya Skillet. Disappointing. Covered in a gloppy sauce, bland and only minimal sausage. Needs to come off the menu.",

    "text": "First things first...This hotel is very big, pretty, and clean. The hotel staff are all really friendly and helpful. It's like a Vegas Style resort(One of the reasons why Nashville is refereed to as Nashvegas?). There are tons of restaurant options, fun little bars, and maps all over the place. I didn't get lost once. With that said..... \n\nMy advice to someone coming to Nashville for the first time is... Don't stay here. Here are my reasons why: \n\n-It's far from town. About 10 miles. And let's be real...that's probably why you come to Nashville?\n\n-Unless you have a rental car, you will be in Taxi or shuttle debt. One way to downtown in Taxi is $25 or the Gaylord shuttle is $30 something for Roundtrip...but the last pickup was a little too early for my liking. \n\n-The city bus doesn't come very often and doesn't run late. But a way cheaper way to get into town. ($1.60) \n\n-The restaurants are expensive and they don't have any local appeal. When I'm traveling, I want to eat local fare. Why isn't there southern food, bbq? \n\n-I feel like they basically want you to stay on their property the entire time! \n\n-Expensive! I didn't have to pay for my room (thank god) but if I had to I couldn't afford to. \n\nAll in all, I had a great time in Nashville...but having stayed here I spent way more money on transportation then I thought I would. \nThis place is definitely worth checking out but I would skip staying here.",

    "text": "As Olive Garden restaurants go, this one is OK. We had a very short wait for a table -- probably would have been faster, but, they called us and then had to have a discussion about some nefarious drivel before seating us. We were seated in the large dining room in the back beside a table with a small child who was either ignored by the 4 adults at the table or encouraged to be \"cute\" by screeching loudly or banging her spoon on the table. I understand Olive Garden is a family restaurant, but seat all the \"families\" together and let couples with no children sit someplace else that is fairly quiet. To the 4 adults sitting at that table, shame on you! You are not doing that child any favors and the screeching was NOT cute and she was certainly old enough to know how to behave.\n\nThe food was good and our server was GREAT! She was very attentive, but not hovering. We would go back, but I'll put my foot down next time if we are shown to a table beside a small child!!",

The big Sapporo was $10. The edamame was awesome, the philly roll was awesome as is the standard, the spicy tuna was good and the dragon roll wasn't for me, I didn't enjoy it. For two people I felt the meal was worth about $40-$45 not the $60 we paid. I will probably try somewhere else the next time I get a hankering for sushi. The decor is plain and simple, a few large tables, people sit together, it wasn't too crowded. Nice people, good food, a bit overpriced. I wouldn't not recommend it but it's not the greatest. I'd give it 2.5 stars if I could but I'll err on the nice side",

I ordered a Monte cristo, French toast honey roasted ham, mascarpone and pineapple I couldn't wait to dig in. My boyfriend ordered salmon Beni and it looked fabulous. Just as I took a bite of my sandwich which was great  my boyfriends facial expression changed as he pulled a long piece of blond hair from his food. Needless to say we were done, however they did comp our meal and gave us a few free doughssants.  They were very apologetic about the incident.

This place looks like it would be a lot of fun with an outdoor seating area for live reggae music and a well-designed interior that that reminds you of the tropics. \nThe prices are on the high side but the food itself is pretty good. The service is just god awful though. We waited 45 minutes from our initial order to get an order of bread  and a drink. It was another 20 minutes to get the actual entrees. The beef ribs and chicken jerk are authentic, reminded me of trips to Jamaica. The rice is so-so and the same for the cabbage and plantains and in my opinion, the coco bread isn't worth it. I would like to give this place a better rating because the point of going there was the jerk chicken but the service was terrible enough to make you regret going. \nThat all being said, I'm planning on going to the live reggae shows they have and ordering take-out when the urge for jerk chicken arises.",

I have never had but positive experiences at Penang regarding the food - excellent dishes. Last night ate at the restaurant with two friends. Had two excellent appetizers - Roti Canai and chicken/beef sticks. For our main courses we had the pad Thai and another chicken dish with rice. Waiter came by with the bill and I handed him my credit card. Seemed to take a longer time than usual even though they were not overwhelming busy. I was not able to see where the waiter took my credit card to - though it appeared to travel through a back door alongside of the kitchen area. The check comes back fully processed, I add a tip and almost immediately (within the next 5 minutes - I kid you not) I receive an email warning from Capital One (on my cell phone) notifying me of a fraudulent charge for $348.51 at a Royal Farms / Fresh Kitchen (Gas station & convenience store) down at Ridley Park, PA close to the airport. How can I be in two places at once? Created a red flag across Capital One servers. Word of caution - use cash if coming to Penang.",

Shake Shack came to town (literally right across the street) and I've eaten numerous delicious burgers. Returning around 5:45 on a Friday we were lucky to score seats at the end of the skinny counter in the back of the restaurant. It is very tight quarters and there are no hooks for purses or coats. We started with the fried shrimp as an appetizer. The portion size allowed an easy split between two people. They were small shrimp served with a dipping sauce with a bit of a spicy kick. I had the village burger and added cheese for an extra $2.50 accompanied by duck fat fries.  The burger was decent, but I would not longer suggest it is worth the wait or the cramped quarters if you don't have a table. The service was shotty, as we had to constantly ask for refills on our water and diet cokes. We didn't even have drinks when our entrees arrived. They don't take reservations so it's really luck of the draw coming here.",

The place is physically set up to serve Sushi on one side and the Hibachi tables are on the other side.  We said Hibachi which I thought meant individual tables and a back room kitchen made meal.  I was pleasantly surprised to be shown to one of those U shaped tables with the hot grill in the middle, a la Arigato's, Kobe's and a host of other Japanese Teppanyaki style cooking.  Ahhh, this is going to be good. We were a little earlier than the lunch crowd and it looked like the sushi side of the house was doing well.  Our side had 3 hibachi tables fully seated and the chef's doing their thing...ie egg into the hat, onion choo choo, etc.  \nI chose Beef and Chicken and asked for only vegetables, no rice.  After all the fancy cooking, the metal spatulas and knives flying around, I got Beef and Chicken, vegetables and rice.  Later on, the manager and head Hibachi supervisor apologized time and time again.  No big deal.  I brought most of the rice home anyway for our granddaughter.  However, I noted one thing.  Don't be at the wrong end of the table.  It seemed the other folks to my right got decent portions of each item, I ended up with what was left, which appeared slightly less on the beef, chicken and vegetables.  Also, I asked for medium cooked on the beef, others asked for well done.  The beef went on and came off the grill at the same time, so how was mine any different from their's. \n\nAll in all, an okay experience.  Will I go back....maybe.",

After we parked along the street nearby, I went in to ask if we could sit out on the patio and although the hostess was not spotted, I saw two staffers chatting at the bar area who immediately spotted me, so I asked them about sitting on the patio.  One of them said we could and apologized about not being up front at the restaurant when I walked in, which was totally fine with us.  He was very, very nice and allowed us to pick a table outside and got us menus before our server came out, which was shortly after.  And with the great service - our server was very nice and checked in with us about getting refills, getting more beers, bringing anything else, etc...  She also was well-informed about the menu when we would ask for specifics on items.\n\nUnfortunately though, I didn't like my burger as much as I had hoped.  I ordered the Taco Truck Burger, which came with guac, sour cream and tortilla chips on a burger, so sounded amazing!  But it wasn't something I'd order again, as I thought it was very bland - even with all of the jazzed up toppings.  It didn't taste like the patty was seasoned at all nor the guac, which was odd.  The sweet potato tots though were yummy.  I do like that instead of fries you can get tots, especially sweet potato tots.  I recommend getting the sweet potato tots with the garlic aioli that the server recommended for me when I asked if she could bring me an aioli to go with.  I just wished the burger had been more to my liking.  \n\nThey have some local beers on taps, and most are from the east coast.  Patio seating was spacious, looking out to the street/Gulch area and they have heated outdoor lamps there.",

    "text": "This place was just OK.  My fianc\u00e9e and I shared their warm salad with vinaigrette as an app.  It was very interesting and flavorful.  Oddly enough, it was literally a head of romaine on a plate with vinaigrette, strawberries, tomatoes and blue cheese on top.  We both really enjoyed it.    For entrees, I got veal medallions with mozzarella and prosciutto in a mushroom sauce and my fianc\u00e9e got their stuffed calamari in linguine.  Mine wasn't too bad although I was expecting the veal to be more tender.  It was slightly tough and dry.  Her calamari was surprisingly tough and chewy which kinda ruined things.\n\nAll in all, we had a good time.  It's a quaint place and the service was excellent.  The food just fell a bit short of our expectations.  It wasn't TOO expensive, but at this price point, the food should be better.  Unfortunately, I don't think we'll be back.",

    "text": "During the 80s as a child my family used to go to Micha's fairly often. Once I was on my own I didn't return for any particular reason. I always liked it and remember the food being very good with a decent atmosphere too. \n\nAfter a very long hiatus, I decided on whim to return with my own family. The atmosphere was still good, although the place was slightly worn around the edges in a good way. That's to be expected after almost a quarter of a century. It's a casual family place, not a fine dining establishment.\n\nThe food was still very good, maybe not quite up to par with what I remembered, but I don't know if that is just an artifact of memory or actual reality. We were served with only one bowl of tortilla chips with no refills offered. I don't know if refills cost extra, or if it was just laxness on our server's part. The chips were fresh and decent, but some weren't warm. The salsa was very good. I ordered the #17 combination plate, in which I had a red chili chimichanga along with refried beans and rice. The red chili had tender cubes of beef in a savory red chili sauce. At some Mexican restaurants the red chili sauce has a somewhat bland taste marred with a texture that is too thick presumably due to too much flour as a thickening agent. Not a Micha's as the sauce had just the right amount of thickness. Going overboard with red chili sauce, I ordered my chimi enchilada style, and it was very good and covered with melted cheddar cheese. The chimi itself was perfectly crisp on the outside with more of a non-fried flour tortilla texture on the inside, which is good but slightly different than the usual chimichangas in the area as they are more crispy throughout the tortilla wrapping. The refried bean were very flavorful and covered with melted cheese also. The rice was tasty, but it lukewarm and had a few cold clumps in it, so I would only say it was only fair. My wife had a carne asada burrito. It was good, but it was pretty dry and lacked the amount of onions and tomatoes that other places typically have. To counteract the dryness she ordered a side of guacamole, which also was a little atypical. The guacamole had a lot of onions, but the unusual part was that it also had some cottage cheese mixed in. Unusual, but good. One of my sons got a bean chimichanga, which was like mine in that it was crispy on the outside, but less so than other places on the inside. He liked it a lot. My other son ordered a machaca taco, chicken enchilada and rice. His plate looked good, and he said it was great. \n\nThe service was good but not great. Our server was for the most part all business and not overly friendly. The bus boy was very friendly, however.\n\nI would go back again. My kids loved it, and I thought it was good, but my wife was only partially impressed. So it won't be a place that we would frequent with any regularity, but I wouldn't hesitate to go again",

I understand that not everywhere has something I love, but I remained hopeful!\nThe inside is darling and has a promising ambiance. We were sat at a tiny table that was incredible unstable. Once we had our waters and coffee the table was nearly full and very shakey. Our server was an awkward girl who wouldn't look us in the eyes. \nI ordered the sweet potato hash with no eggs and my fianc\u00e9e had duck fat gravy with biscuits. My meal had little to no flavor and I ended up using tobasco to make it resemble tasting like something. My Fianc\u00e9e said his meal had no flavor and was greasey. \nMaybe if we ordered differently, we could really like the place, but we are turned off by it now. If you go, do not get the sweet potato hash!",

    "text": "I'm giving Bottleworks three stars based upon the dining/food experience - particularly what you get for the money you have to spend there. My rating is not based upon their bar/beer and general environment as a whole.\n\nI like Schlafly Bottleworks as a bar/patio spot and I appreciate Schlafly's approach in general. They host some great events, have a really nice space, good beer, and have friendly service. But that said, the food has not been great for me here.\n\nIn my past two visits I've tried something pricey and then something cheap. Ho-hum on both. First - the pricey dish, which was the pretzel encrusted chicken. Schlafly is not the least bit shy charging $15-$19 for their entrees, and this one is $18. The chicken was a decent portion, I suppose. But it was a tad dry overall. Flavor just OK. The mashed potatoes which come with it were good. But for $18 I better be full and happy, plain and simple.\n\nThen last night I was really hungry and went for the Bottleworks Burger. This was definitely a disappointment. I ordered it Medium, it came out pretty much well-done. That I could tolerate if it were either A.) Juicy or B.) flavorful. I got neither here. The potato wedges were awesome, however.\n\nNow, I saw someone order the Bison Meatball Spaghetti and that looked huge and appetizing. \n\nI do love the bar and patio here, and they often get in some good live music. But unfortunately the food prices for what you get are just a bit suspect to me.",

    "text": "We were feeling hungry after a long day and decided to have dinner with family and friends at BK's. We are seated promptly and our waitress took our drink and appetizer order.  A short time later,  our drinks and appetizers arrived. The drinks were great and the guac with chips was fantastic.   \n\nOur waitress took our dinner order and we patiently waited for our food.  The waitress checked on us frequently and kept us pretty hydrated.  As time passed,  we noticed that the restaurant was delivering food to tables that were seated after us and even sat new customers after those folks left and feed them too!\n\nWe asked our waitress, what's going on with our food? She replied,  \"hasn't the manager been out to talk to you?\"  We said, \"no\" and our waitress said, \"I will ask her again to come out and talk to you.\"  A short time later, a young lady came out and brought us complimentary guacamole and warm chips and said this is for waiting on the food.  \n\nWe waited a long time before we saw our waitress again.  When she came by she asked if we had talked to the manager. After we stated we hadn't, she proceeded to call the manager again and check on our food.\n\nWhen the manager arrived at our table, it was the same lady who brought the chips and guac! She was very unpleasant and never provided any explanation other than it was busy and the steaks were frozen when we ordered them. Okay...let me apologize for my party ordering the t-bone steaks and for me ordering the cabreria. \n\nWe explained that no one ever mentioned a delay or asked if we wanted to change our order which we could have done hours ago. She pretty much just walked away like no big deal if you are not happy. \n\nAt least lie to me and say you ran out of some main ingredient and had to run to the store. Bring out the food that is ready and feed the antsy children on the table.  Very disappointed with how she handled the situation or I guess how she didn't handle it.\n\nThe food finally came out. I would like to give zero stars for the manager but food and micheladas were still great even though it took hours to arrive. \n\nBTW, the cabreria was fantastic.  \n\nThere was a time when i thought that Bk's competitor was better than this restaurant but over the years the competition started sacrificing their quality and customer service.  I hope that this isn't happening to this restaurant.",

    "text": "Good food and for a chain very good food. It lived up to its reputation of serving fresh food. I give it three stars instead of four mainly because it's probably not on my top 10 places in Reno for Mexican food. Chipotle is not even my favorite Mexican-themed chain restaurant. That would be El Pollo Loco.\nFor my meal I got a burrito with beef, black beans, white rice, sour cream, cheese, lettuce and maybe some other stuff. I added a patrone margarita and a bag of chips with what they described as their hottest sauce.\nI had to wait about a month to try the place because the lines were so long the previous times I came. The staff was friendly when I placed my order. I got my burrito, chips and salsa when I paid and the maragarita came a few minutes later.\nChipotle failed to live up to the hype with my first bite of food. The chips are good quality chips. The salsa tastes mass produced. It was supposed to be their hottest salsa but it had a streak of that sweet ketchup flavor some shows up in salsas some times. My favorite salsas are the red salsa from the Michoacan region of Mexico with its nice garlic kick. \nThe ingredients in the burrito were fresh, but there were two significant flaws. No. 1 is that the rice overwhelmed everything else. Usually if one ingredient overwhelms a burrito it seems it is the beans, but not in this case. It made the burrito bland and a little dry. The second flaw was all the gristle I found on the beef. My tray had more than a half dozen chunks of inedible meat on it by the time I finished. I decided to spare Yelpers a photo of that.\nThe margarita was okay. I'd get one again but it was routine.\nThere's basically two kinds of wine bars: Those that serve wine that wine geeks like (these are the ones that have the hardest time surviving) and those that are a place where women feel safe to drink. I get the sense that Chipotle is a Mexican restaurant designed to make gringos feel safe to eat there.  Again, for a chain, they serve good quality food. I can get better food for less money at a half dozen taquerias around town. \nChipotle is a smoke jalapeno used in cooking. For people who have never had a good chipotle in a Mexican restaurant, I would suggest trying the camarones ala diabla (devil shrimp) at La Fuente in Sparks. It's quite a bit spicier than the hot salsa served at Chipotle but it has great depth of flavor.",

    "text": "Pleasantly surprised for an Arizona casino. Attracts many types of people and really isn't too far from the Tucson city center. Inside, there is a sky ceiling a laThe Venetian or The Paris in Las Vegas, which have a particularly brighter look inside the casino due to the \"sky-hued\" ceiling. Nice touch.\nBlackjack tables have first-deal surrender which seems to be beyond the comprehension of most of the locals who come there to bet $50 to hit a 16 when dealer is showing a 10. I was surrendering a ton and was called out on it by a guy who was losing about 5 times the amount I was ( was actually up due to being able to scavenge some dollars on sure losses). He just didn't get it, and continued hitting crappy hands, successful maybe twice. So that's the thing, at this casino, even the dealers think surrender is a scam, that it messes up cards, but that's wrong if its done in a judicious way. So if you use surrender you will see eyes roll around you, be wary of that. Must not be in the local culture to \"give up\", but instead just lose it all trying to beat a 20. That was my experience anyway. \nThey also have Spanish 21 which allows second-deal surrender and up. Pretty interesting, but the minimum bets are almost always higher (greater than $5). Pai-gow and, I believe, Baccarat are also available. I'd recommend this casino for aesthetic purposes over Desert Diamond.",

    "text": "I fell in love with Three Muses after looking at Yelp reviews and the restaurant's website. I feel that the website led me to believe it was a more formal tablecloth kind of place and I was a bit surprised when I arrived.  I could care less about tablecloths, just a minor observation as a direct result of the website.\n\nWhen we arrived 20 minutes early for our 6pm Tuesday evening reservation we were greeted by the hostess and immediately informed that no matter what, there is a very strict policy that we would only have the table for 1.5 hours and that if we wanted to enjoy the music after that, we would have to go to the bar. I completely understand why this is their policy, but early on a weeknight when the restaurant is more than half empty it is a bit rude to start with the policy. Plus, what if our meal had taken longer than 1.5 hours? Are you booted to the bar for dessert?\n\nAnyway, onto the food...below is a list of the items we ordered any any commentary:\n\n-Italian baked Mac & Cheese-I LOVE every kind of cheese possibly imaginable and I was so excited for this dish. When it arrived the pasta was a little too firm and the flavor was extremely bland.  My friends and I barely ate a quarter of the dish. I would never order that again.\n\n-Seared Scallops-I didn't eat them but my friends thought they were scrumptious.\n\n-Bacon wrapped blue cheese stuffed dates-these were incredible. For three of us we got the large order and though they were amazing, I kind of wish we got the small order only because they were so rich. A good kind of rich. I would order these again.\n\n-Beer-Braised Kurobuta Pork Belly-I thought these were really bland, too. I wouldn't order them again.\n\n-Steak & Cake-I only at the steak. I was told the crab cake was amazing and one of the best my friend ever had. The steak was awesome and so tender and flavorful.\n\n-Ms. Moon's Bulgogi Rice Bowl-This item didn't seem to fit in as well with the other items on the menu but don't let it stop you. It was very very yummy and I would absolutely order it again if I went back. It was a hearty portion and the bowl was basically all but licked at the end to eat it all.\n\n-Cardamon Panna Cotta (Ponchatoula Strawberry, Pistachio Biscotti)-I am not a huge panna cotta fan but my friend is and he loved it. I thought it was pretty good when I tried it but have no frame of reference with which to provide any more feedback. \n\n-Fluffernutter Pie (Bruleed Marshmallow, Salted Peanuts)-I was intrigued by this option and ordered it. I was underwhelmed and barely at any.\n\n-Warm Chocolate Cream Cheese Brownie (Malted Vanilla Ice Cream, Cherry)-per our waitress' recommendation we substituted the vanilla ice cream for brandied butter pecan ice cream and boy was she right. This was AMAZING. I loved the ice cream the most out of all elements of the three desserts. The brownie was tasty though I am not a huge chocolate fan.\n\nThe live music was nice and the atmosphere was okay. I have a feeling later on a weekend it would be a lot more lively and fun (and packed).",

John's just looked like an old school mainstay, so we opted to try it rather than some of the hipster-ish alternatives.  Inside, looks like the y last updated in 1970, wood paneling, old light fixtures - but it had a homey quaint feel.  Huge bar, cheap drinks.  This is definitely a locals place. Menu looked like a reliable list of traditional pub food - though we just enjoyed $2 pints. Media is an upscale town, so I doubt this place could attract the crowds it does unless the food was decent. Don't come here if you want an open-arms welcome or any pleasantries from the bartender. This is pay-as-you-go baby.",

The burger that was also served at my table was significantly overcooked.  It was ordered medium and came out closer to well done.  We ate it anyway.  Everything was good.  The fried pork skin appetizer was a bit too salty.  \n\nOverall, I was impressed, and will be back.  But if I'm spending $11 on a burger, I'm hoping it will be cooked closer to the correct temperature next time.",

    "text": "(only a three star review because we were only able to try the crab cakes and the clam chowder, so it's not fair to give this place too high or too low of a mark)\n\nquickly:\nCrab cakes - tender and crumbly. They don't taste like \"crab\" which is what I prefer. The crab cakes come with a side of gianormos onion rings (i loved those).\n\nclam chowder - pretty standard. it didn't blow your mind, but it also wasn't too \"fishy\" which can happen with clam chowder.\n\nWe saw everyone ordering crab and lobster, and we just salivated at the thought - we had dinner plans later that day so we couldn't try any of the big shellfish items. They definitely looked delicious!\n\nsome notes: \n-The indoor seating is limited. It's a small \"shack\" at the end of the pier. It was cold and windy the day we were there (yeah, can you believe it?) so there was more of a wait to sit inside.\n- not good for big groups indoors\n-parking is free with validation",

I can't really drive and go to places to dine in because I just had a newborn and its not easy getting around sometimes so I was looking for something via delivery. \n\nSo since I haven't had tacos in a long time I decided to give this place a try with all the good reviews I'd see. Sorry to say it wasn't the best tacos I've had in Philly. I'd ordered the tacos al pastor. It tasted sweet with little to no flavor and I had asked for the red spicy sauce but why was there green spicy sauce on my tacos? Although I like how you can choose your own toppings but it wasn't my kind of tacos. I love trying new places and once I found the place that fits my expectations I just stick to that one place but this one wasn't for me . I've ordered burrito for my boyfriend's daughter and the portion was huge but I took a bite and it was just okay. I'm not really a fan of burrito anyway. \n\nDelivery was quick but I don't think I'll be return.",

We saw people dressed up kind of fancy as well as people in khaki shorts and tshirts.\n\nMy wife and I recently went on a Friday night and were able to get a table rather quickly. The service was definitely slow for our tastes. There were mostly larger groups in the place, but we definitely felt that we did not receive much attention.\n\nThe bread that came out before the meal was hot and decent overall. The wine menu was about what you would expect, all the traditional wines with the cheapest (only a couple) in the low $20s for a bottle and quickly escalating to high prices from there. \n\nWe passed on appetizers and desserts and both ordered the seafood pasta. I would say we were both underwhelmed by it to be honest. I had some pretty high expectations for this plate and while I found it edible...it's not something I would order again.\n\nWe then sat around quite a while waiting for our check.\n\nOverall, I feel like we didn't get the full experience of what this place could be. We may try it again in the future, but with Gino's about the same distance from home, which much better service and larger portions for the same price, it would be tough to convince ourselves to come back.",

    "text": "I really enjoyed my visit at Honeys for brunch today. The environment was very homey and the service was more than helpful. This review is mostly based on the food that I get was more or less - subpar. I ordered the eggs benedict with a side of grits; I had no complaints with the meal but it wasn't life changing either.  My friend got the country fried steak with a side of eggs, home fries, and a biscuit; I also tried her food and concluded that the home fries were very well seasoned and delicious. The biscuit was pretty sweet for my liking, but my friend enjoyed it well. The country fried steak, however, is why I had to down a star - while the batter was delicious, the steak was over-battered. My fried had to really dig into the steak to slice me a piece. The steak itself was a bit tough and took a while for us to chew and swallow. \nWe shared a side of mac and cheese and a pork sausage. The mac and cheese was very creamy, cheesy, seasoned properly and close to perfect. I wasn't a big fan of the pork sausage, since it was on the sweeter side. \n\nOVERALL, this is a brunch place worth trying. I would not write this place off my list, and would definitely come again - but would just order and try something different.",

    "text": "Make reservations!!! That is the most important thing about this restaurant. The food was a little better than average and the portion sizes were substantial but it certainly was not out of this world. We ended up going to the restaurant on a Saturday night after our first choice was so booked that we did not want to wait hours for a meal. However, we were fooled by the hostess at the restaurant. We we arrived we were told that the wait would be about 45-60 minutes, which was okay for 7pm and not something that would be unusually. Well as we sat and waited we noticed that everyone that came in after us no matter how many other people put their name on the list it was always 45-60 minutes. The wait time was never adjusted for the people that came after we did. So we ended up waiting almost two hours for a table. My wife ordered the red fish dinner and I ordered the steak dinner. After we ordered I joked with my wife that they might run out of food which was the wrong thing to do because they did run out of the steak. I do not run a restaurant but I find it very strange that they would run out of a staple dinner on a Saturday night when it was not on special. So I had to get the pork chops. Well while my wife's dinner was good the pork chops were so dry that it needed a sauce or something to make them edible. Also I got about two spoonfuls of rice and three measly carrots. If it would not have been so late I would have run to a McDonald's in order to get some more food to eat. We were also give only one loaf of bread and were never offered or asked if we wanted another. Honestly I think there are better places to eat in the area. I found it to be over priced and pretentious.",

We also ended up with an odd, gelatinous beef that wasn't to my taste at all but I am sure it was a mistake of ordering to my liking rather than sub par cooking by the restaurant. I would return, but I think I would go for their soup with roast duck and dumplings over dim sum next time. Their duck and pork and bakery case items always look so tasty when I am here.",

However, I wouldn't give it five stars (or even four stars) based on this visit.  First of all, there was a considerable delay between the time we finished our salads and the serving of the entree (the server was apologetic about this).  Also, my Chicken Francese was tender and tasty, but swimming in an excessive amount of lemon sauce.",

    "text": "This is a cute little place, but it needs to define itself a little better.\n\nPerhaps I was expecting too much after hearing it described as a gourmet grocery store.  I was dreaming of a tiny Whole Foods in downtown Tampa.  I didn't expect the (mostly non-organic) produce section to be found in a single refrigerator or to find bagged shredded cheese in the dairy section.\n\nI appreciate the low prices for the sandwiches.  They are pre-assembled, but they get heated/pressed to order.  I tried the turkey reuben.  Something in the sandwich (either the turkey or the sauerkraut) was very herby, and it dominated the dish, so I didn't get that wonderful reuben harmony I expected.  It was disappointing.\n\nI probably won't return for a sandwich, but this is a nice place to grab a bottle of wine or beer and maybe some gourmet snacks.  This is certainly not a replacement for a real grocery store.",

    "text": "Look, I would have given this place a much better rating if it wasn't for one thing, the hostesses... and I'm not referring to those delicious prophylactic wrapped cakes made of chocolate, air, and pure magic.  I swear they hire these girls on looks alone - \"tight pants, high heel boots, and wear that nose high.\"  They obviously have little to zero math skills, or are fans of Einstein and reject time completely.  Every single time I trek to this place, I fear I might lose it when walking in the 2x2 foyer where one of these anti-Newton fashionistas is prepped to tell me the wait will be about two hours.  The place seats maybe 50 people tops, with zero people waiting outside (the only place to wait), and barely any names on their scribble sheet.  I can guarantee you that you'll get the same response unless they are subjective to a certain type of clientele, that usually appears to be midlife crisis men exacting revenge on life by dating girls that resemble their daughters, or younger couples that try to divide the class of the place with the ability to get obnoxiously wasted in less than a half an hour.  You can give your name and number to one of these ladies, who will promptly call you in the amount of time it takes you to chose another nearby restaurant and get seated; nowhere near their previous predicted span of time.  This could be some new trend... you know, like all those other hard to get in bars that only serve hamburgers.  Now for the good stuff; the burgers are excellent... some of the best, if not the best in the city.  The selection of whiskey, as the name should denote, is quite expansive.  The d\u00e9cor is warm and inviting, though a tad cramped if you're not sitting towards the front of the bar.  Both Tinto and Village Whiskey always seem to have excellent bartenders, with not only the experience sought after, but the social skills as well.  My suggestion is to definitely try this place out, but pick a weekday and take a bottle of wine just in case, because Melograno is only steps away in the chance you'll be told it'll take the sum over histories to land an exclusive spot to have... yep, a burger.",

    "text": "Sorry Yelpers, but I thought this Jose Garces restaurant was just okay.\n\nVillage Whiskey is pretty tiny.  About seven round tables that could fit maybe three people (might be able to fit four, but highly unlikely) and some room at the bar.  Came for lunch at 11:30am when they opened, and by about 12:15pm, all the tables and most of the seats at the bar were taken.  \n\nWe were the second group to be seated, and although there was no one else in the restaurant at the time, our waitress seemed to be preoccupied after taking our order.  She knew we were still deciding on drinks, so why didn't she check on us again?  Hello!  She wasn't very attentive and seemed like she would rather be elsewhere.\n\nI ordered the Village Burger (an 8 ounce burger on a sesame roll with Boston bibb lettuce, tomato, and house-made thousand island dressing: $11) and added Jasper Hill cheddar cheese ($3.50) and fried egg ($1.50).  Perfect brunch meal right?  Eh.  Was just okay.  The burger wasn't anything spectacular, definitely not anything to rave about.  It was juicy, but lacked flavor.  Usually the bun makes the burger (for me at least), and I thought the sesame roll was okay.  Tasted like an everyday burger bun to me.  The cheddar cheese and fried egg were a nice additional to the burger.  At 8 ounces, this burger is pretty huge!  Could definitely serve as another meal or late night snack.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/EtKSTHV5Qx_Q7Aur9o4kQQ?select=QZ4Yn47TLprQlbCRWMtZdw\n\nWe also ordered the duck fat french fries with sly-fox cheddar sauce ($7) to share.  I've always always wanted to try duck fat fries.  These left me wanting more.  Really...is this what they really taste like?  I hope not.  These fries were more soggy than crispy, and left a weird after taste in my mouth.  The cheddar sauce was a welcomed additional, but not necessary.  The sauce would have been better if it was hotter.  \n\nWhen our waitress finally came back with our food, we were able to order the Irish Car Bomb shake ($9).  Ours definitely didn't look like a lot of the pictures that were posted on Yelp.  For $9, this shake better be spectacular!  Again, it was just okay.  I did enjoy those chunks of brownie pieces though! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/EtKSTHV5Qx_Q7Aur9o4kQQ?select=EbqJLiD6Pkw7u1KgFVmJAA\n\nRG ordered the Whiskey King (an 8 ounce burger on a sesame roll with maple bourbon glazed ciopollini, rogue bleu cheese, applewood bacon, and foie gras-$26).  Massive burger.  The bleu cheese was almost non-existent.  I tried a bite, and the foie gras was pretty good.  The applewood bacon was a nice touch.  But again, the burger was just okay.  \n\nFYI-Don't look up at the ceiling fans, they were so filled with dirt, that you might get dust in your eyes!",

It was pretty busy for a Tuesday night so we expected a little bit of a wait for our meal. But the wait was compounded by service issues.\n\nWe ordered the Vietnamese Pancake for an appetizer and Pho and Vermicelli for our entrees. Our order was taken pretty promptly but it took over a half hour for our pancake to be served. A party who arrived after us got their appetizer about ten minutes before us.\n\nIt took another twenty minutes to get my vermicelli but Baby's pho was nowhere to be found nor did our server (the older gentleman) offer an explanation or apology. We waited a minute or two but when the pho still didn't come, I flagged down the other (young) server who said he would check into it. He came back apologetically alluding to some issue and promised it would come soon.\n\nFinally, about five minutes later, our original server delivered the pho without a word nor any acknowledgement of a problem. This is the same guy who at our last dinner forgot to place part of our order and then double charged us. \n\nIt seems we're not the only ones whose order he screwed up. As we were taking care of our bill, we heard the party behind us pointing out that something was missing from their take-out order.\n\nThe owner used to be here frequently but we haven't seen him in quite some time so I'm wondering if in his absence he's taken his eyes off the ball leading to the slippage in service.\n\nWe really want to continue supporting Oriental Pearl so I'm hoping that they  take steps to get back on track.",

I'm glad I did!\n\nThe upstairs seating area was pretty sparsely populated on a Wednesday night, but there were some folks watching Game 1 in the bar downstairs - we knew about it because of the hoots when something good happened for the Cards. \n\nThe drink menu was diverse and yet manageable. Quite often when I go to some restaurants in places like St. Louis or Denver, the drink menu seems to be competing for who can use the most trees to document the amount of alcohol they have available. For someone who is terrible at making choices, I hate those places, since there's just TOO much good stuff! Kudos, Bailey's Range, for helping those of us who are indecisive!\n\nI ended up ordering a red wine to go with by burger - interesting choice, I know, but I was NOT feeling beer last night for whatever reason. I ordered the Smoked burger, which has caramelized onions and cheese and rooster sauce. It was awesome. The bun was soaking up all the delicious grease from the cheese and the meat, and the whole experience was just great. \n\nI would definitely recommend this place for burgers - there wasn't much else on the menu to choose from, but this would be a great hit-the-spot place for a burger craving!",

We also had mango and blueberry fruit slushes - refreshing and tasty, and probably not easily found in Reno.  The disappointment, however, for me was the pork chow fun.  The noodles were oily, yellow (like they were egg and not rice) and a bit chewy versus the usual wider, white \"ho fan\" ribbon noodles.  Dry fried Chow Fun typically has brown char marks from wok frying which provide the flavor, and these noodles didn't seem like they were fried.  A better nearby choice for Chow Fun, IMHO, would be Pho Mein in the El Dorado.",

I will not eat meat that is red. I have never ordered steak and not been asked how I'd like it cooked. EVER! Once food arrived, my husband said the salad was the best he's ever eaten but the steak was definitely cooked medium. (I didn't order a side salad) I opted to eat the smaller pieces as they were cooked to my liking. The onion straws that were under the steak got me excited because they are my all time favorite side item, but they were chewy as if they had laid under a heat lamp a little too long and were not fresh. I was very disappointed in this $80+ meal. Had the steak been cooked medium well and the onion straws fresh, this meal would've been delicious!",

Now I have a major complaint about this witch waitress they employee there - we had sat at a table that was filled with plates and glasses from previous guests. When she came by to deliver our first dining selection I asked her if she could have someone clear the table she turned around to me to say \"around here it is what it is' ...and left.  I wanted to snatch her wig right off her head. In no establishment should there be that attitude.  You can have the funkiest and most bohemian style place on earth but you don't treat a customer like that ... and on this one occasion in my entire life I didn't feel compelled to leave her at tip. Management needs to find this witch and ditch her.\n\nLoved the atmosphere.  There is a lot of cleaning up that could be done to the place just to keep it special e.g. broken walkways are going to lead to an accident for sure. \n\nThis is a fantastic place - they need to step up the seating/dining area outside a good bit however - that's an accident waiting to happen.",

I had many questions and took up a lot of her time.  She was thorough and patient despite me calling late-evening.  I ordered shrimp chow mein with extra shrimp ($1 for 3), vegetable fried rice with added egg, mixed saut\u00e9ed vegetables, steamed white rice, and a side of sweet & sour sauce.  My order was delivered much more quickly than I had expected given my experience with other local restaurants.  Everything I ordered I got, including the extra shrimp and side sauces.  The food was still hot enough to eat without having to reheat it.  It was good -- even better than a longtime well-known-local that charges double the price!  I do wish the vegetable fried rice would have had just that -- vegetables, instead of just literally a few peas.  However, the rice was neither mush nor greasy.  The steamed white rice was like any other.  The shrimp chow mein was also not greasy, which surprised me given my experiences at other places.  But the shrimp in it was, well, odd.  It was cooked but the texture was unusual and the shape was ...round?   The saut\u00e9ed mixed veggies were d-lish and I will definitely order them again; I did have to add salt as I couldn't taste any at all.  Based on the food, fair pricing, delivery, and delightful lady that took my order, I say give 'em a try.  They have a decent menu from which to choose.",

With so many good mom and pop shops in the area I don't bother ordering pizza or sandwiches from here, though they are still way better than the crap you'd get from one of the national chains.",

Food is decent too but nothing out of the norm.  Most of the times I've come here and ordered the same thing, it wasn't consistent or maybe I remembered it to be different?  \n\nMy favorite things to order here is the vegan wings, and even though I am a meat eater, they are pretty good.  Also, their desserts are usually on point, more so than their entrees.  They had a smores bread pudding that was to die for that they removed from their menu.\n\nIf i want drinks I stop on in here from time to time but if I want food, I walk down the street to Dos Segundos that always delivers. The only bonus I like is outdoor seating area where you can hang out with your friend and people watch.",

You don't get many cracklings but they are really good. The tomatoes were actually cooked almost perfect a few were alittle dark but still delicious. I order smoked sausage, it was more like a spicy smoke sausage you buy at your local price chopper. Note this I thought I was ordering a sausage plate but I only got a bare plate full of sausage no sides no bread. My wife got the veggie burger and sweet pot fries, burger was so so fries were good. The couple with us said they liked there's so I cannot contest. The service and atmosphere is where it was at. Oh I did try some of my buddies pulled pork and it was really good, remembered now cause I wish I would have ordered it",

They have not.\n\nI had to clear my throat loudly to entice someone to come from the back to actually help me.\n\nI was in on a Sunday afternoon and while they weren't busy there were hardly any cupcakes to purchase. I was surprised by the lack of variety despite being there with over 3 hours of business hours left until closing. The two cupcakes I purchased were lemon (for the wife), and a chocolate caramel pretzel combo of some sort. Once I paid for them I was anxious to eat mine. \n\nI got them home and once we had lunch it was time for dessert. My wife tried hers, one bite was all she took to be done. She said it the icing was too sweet and the cake too dry. I felt the same about my mine. Also, the caramel part in the description was not at all present in my cupcake. It really amounted to overly granulated sugary icing with crushed up pretzel bits on top. The frosting had crusted over so it clearly wasn't fresh. The cake was also dry so it too wasn't fresh. You are a cupcake place, that only makes cupcakes but you can't do that well? Clearly, this just doesn't compute.\n\nNext time, I will save myself from these dry cupcakes and make my own.",

It used to be a donut shop, and the feel of that still lingers - not many restaurants where you can order your food and check your lottery tickets.\n\nIt was very quiet for a Saturday night at 6 (meaning, it was just us) so we were able to ask questions and chat with the owner who made our order. Really really friendly. Makes you really want to root for them to succeed.\n\nWe ordered quite a few things to go (#YOLO): papusa, empanadas, arepas and cake! The mixed papusa had a bit of everything (meat, cheese, beans) and came with small containers of slaw and a thin salsa. Very traditional, though I think it was too overwhelming with so many fillings - I typically just like it with meat. It was hefty in weight for sure. The empanadas were my favourite!! A sweet-ish dough that was crispy and not too thick (greasy though) and filled with super flavourful shredded beef. I would eat a couple of these as a meal and be quite satisfied. The arepas were ok - again, very greasy to the touch. For fillings we chose the BBQ pork with cheese and the chicharronada (pork skin). The BBQ pork was thick cut and plentiful, but we found it dry and lacking a sauce or something to give it flavour. The chicharron wasn't quite what we expected - it was again, plentiful, but there was *too* much of it and the texture became very tiring quickly (soft & very chewy). The arepas came with a green salsa and a creamy sauce which we definitely used to cut the meat taste. Finally, the three milk cake and the pineapple flan were good but wasn't life changing. I prefer the tres leches cake from other places in town much more.\n\nI would definitely come back for those empanadas because OMG they were delicious. I'd try different arepas too. They have cachapas on the menu which I'm curious to try as well. So, if I'm in the mood for a drive, I'd go there again.",

Last night, a group of 6 dined at 312.  We were seated pretty quick for a Saturday night which was great.  Our server was attentive and patient as we were trying to figure out what we wanted.  A great atmosphere and location in Germantown.  \n\nWe started with the cheese curds and breaded mushroom appetizers, they were good, but I thought they had too much breading though I would still recommend. The sauce served with each was very tasty. \n\nWe ordered two deep dish pizzas - the Capone and the Deerborn Station.  The pizza was pretty good.   Everyone at the table liked it, but we're not blown away.  I did like the ingredients and the sauce was good.  I think the issue was the crust - it was was pretty hard and overly crispy.  I had a hard time cutting it with a knife. Probably burned as the top of the Capone was a little black.  \n\nPerhaps my expectations were too high.  I will try again.",

While dinner was delicious, that is a customer service fail that left me less-than-impressed. \n\nUp to that point, though, I very much enjoyed my dinner here. We started by sharing an order of spring rolls, two large rolls were served cut in half which was a nice portion for sharing. The peanut sauce they are served with is delicious! I had the panang curry -always delicious, although not anything particularly innovative. My friends had the pineapple fried rice (I had a taste - again, good but nothing mind-blowing) and sweet basil chicken (this is something I had never tasted before - yum!). Portion sizes were generous and the prices are reasonable. Service was OK - there was a long wait between appetizer and entrees, and for a while our water glasses were very neglected. \n\nThey would have gotten 4 stars had it not been for their poor advertising of the cash-only policy.

The onion rings were huge and I think would have been  good had they not been so salty. \n\nThey do have things on the menu that look like they could be good, so I would go back.\n\nOh and where it says \"rasher bacon\" on the menu, think ham. My son who really wanted a BLT was very dissappointed in his rasher bacon LT.",

If you need to discuss something with your employees don't do it right in front of customers especially when you are being incredibly rude and over the top.

    "text": "Chiang Mai Thai Noodle is closer than expected. I was pleasantly surprised about the location and realized that I have actually passed this restaurant multiple times while visiting the Broad Ripple area. The atmosphere was very charming and quiet. This was the first time my friend and I had ever been to the restaurant and had heard some positive reviews. The service was very timely and very friendly. It was not very crowded when we first walked in, but started to fill in a little more throughout dinner, but I do not think there was ever a wait list.\n I have only ever been to a few Thai restaurants and only one restaurant has ever stuck out in my mind as a place I want to return. Unfortunately, it is not this restaurant. The location, service and atmosphere were all excellent, but the food fell short of what I expected and still has me craving a stellar chicken pad Thai. The sauce was really the only issue I had with the meal. It was very bland. Granted, I did order it with no spice, but that iconic flavor was missing. My friend that came with me ordered a level 3 spicy level on her meal and actually asked me if they had switched our plates because she could not taste any spiciness at all.  Also, like a few other reviews on this page, I had picked out the chicken from my meal as it did not taste good, flavor and texture. \n But I really do want to emphasize the great service. Our server refilled our waters without our need to call her over. She gave us the check in a timely manner and brought us boxes promptly when requested. I did have leftovers and I wanted to and did take them home. It still had an enjoyable time and pleasant meal, it just was not groundbreakingly awesome in any way.\n As a college student, it solved my constant crisis of wanting food and being on a budget. About 80 percent of the meals on the menu were priced at $10.95 and I thought that was really reasonable for the amount of food we received. I even had leftovers to replace another meal that I would have had to cook for myself, so score. If someone was asking for a Thai restaurant reference I think that I will mention the Chiang Mai Thai Noodle, but also list other options for them to consider.",

I finally had the chance to try this out at the hustling and bustling Jersey City Project Market, where there were quite a few other food vendors inside and food trucks lined up outside. I was surprised The Cow and The Curd truck had no line, compared to the other vendors and food trucks. Then I noticed the portion size you got for $9 (dipping sauces cost extra). There were 8 very tiny cheese bites that fit in a little paper basket that fit inside my small hand. It seemed you got a better bang for your buck at the other food spots. I'm not sure if these are made to order or just kept warm because when I went up and placed my order, I was immediately handed a basket that was just sitting there. It was gooey inside, but definitely not the kind of hot you'd get from being pulled from the fryer. I'm glad I knocked it off my food bucket list but I probably won't be searching them out again.",

When I tasted the stuffing it was barely warm and the lobster meat was a bit dry and not as hot as it should have been. Seem like left over lobster reheated. There was really no reason why the dish was not hot enough as there were hardly any other people there at the time that would have caused them to rush the order out. Some restaurants keep the serving plates hot so that the food stays hot longer. I could have sent it back and told them to heat it up but didn't feel like doing that, because to me there really wasn't any reason for it to be served cold.",

We had, I'm guessing, around 50 people here for the party so there was a lot of wings. The \"hot\" wings were lacking any flavor at all. They simply tasted like chicken wings. The rubbery exterior I can certainly attribute to them having been made well in advance of our arrival, but the lack of spice?? They also prepared sliders that were very dry and rather bland. Service was not too bad considering the amount of people we had. On the plus side the nachos were very good and the beer was \u00dcber cold! We had a good time with family and friends, and we will give them another try (just not with a huge party again 'cause they kinda dropped the ball there).",

Yesterday we tried the food for the first time in Tucson. Here's my feedback. As far as the decor, ambiance and service goes, I give them full points. Their appetizers were very good too. We ordered our favorite koobedieh kebab and that was a disappointment. The dish is definitely not the same as the one they prepare in Scottsdale. It was dry and the marination of the meat was not the same. Even the rice did not have the same flavor. I wish the chef and owners take this as constructive criticism and try to make a change.

They have always done a good job with these (go figure, their name has taco in it.) The burgers are just okay (go figure, they're not a burger restaurant.) \n\nThe one thing they get right in my book, consistently, is accuracy and friendliness. I've never had a mixed up order here and they never forget small details.

However if you're just looking for a good meal and not to brag about what you ate the next day to everyone; you should probably take a pass.\n\nI think the menu must have changed dramatically because it does not match some of the other reviews. I went for lunch but they accidently left me with a dinner menu and there was no \"beer and a burger\" kind of options. \n\nThis place is very trendy and nice but requires a very exquisite palette for enjoyment. The lunch menu I was presented with had one option which I was interested in and that was the People's Choice Cheesesteak.\n\nThe sandwhich was small but very tasty and they did overload me with some home made chips. It cost me about $11.\n\nPersonally when I think of the \"American (New)\" catagory I think of crazy out of this menu items that you may want to try. But also remixes of old classics as well. Like you do something amazing with Tomato Soup or a Cheeseburger with Free Range beef and some spices I've never heard of from an island I didn't know existed. I can't really fault them for that, but if what I ate was any kind of indication of the quality of the food; the price does not match the portion and quality.",

There is a long list of menu choices, and I most of the simpler egg meals are very tasty.  Diced ham and scrambled eggs is my current favorite served with very good hash browns.  The price is right for the entire menu.  Very reasonable.",

    "text": "I've been to Katie's on quite a few occasions, and overtime the food was absolutely delicious, but when I decided to go there for brunch for my birthday.. I was not happy with my experience. First off, I decided on Katie's because I was told they had bottomless mimosas. When I arrived, I had to seat at the bar until my entire party arrived.. there were about 6 of us. I asked the bartender if I could do the bottomless mimosa's, but she said you could only do that when you are seated at a table... FINE, I understand. When the sixth member of our party FINALLY got there and after our table was given away about 3 times, we were finally able to sit, which is when i realized that the people at the bar were drinking out of the bottomless glasses.. So after spending $20 over the price of the bottomless, since I was buying by the glass.. I wasn't happy. But what really set me over the edge was the absolutely RUDE red headed woman. A girl I was with got her steak that was suppose to be cooked RARE anti  was medium well. When we told the woman about the steak ordeal she actually said \"that's our rare\"...... As if there is not a universal cooking scale when it comes meat. No restaurant has a different version of R MR M MW WD.. ITS ALL THE SAME. I've been back since and she is rude every time... Katie's, she's gotta go!",

Upon receiving our food, we noticed several things wrong: I have to admit that when it comes to food and what the food comes on, I tend to be a neat freak. My plate had little specs of brown on it. I consider it disrespectful to serve food on a dirty white plate. It made me very apprehensive about eating it. Regardless, it was the busiest time of day (noon) but I'm sure they were pressing for time. Perhaps this review translates into more of a tip: avoid popular healthy-kick restaurants at busy hours. Still, when everything is up to par, enjoy a sandwich and a spud with extra green onions! You're welcome loves!",

    "text": "I made a reservation at Muriel's for myself and three friends, after reading the glowing reviews. We wanted to eat somewhere fun and elegant over the holidays, and Muriel's fit the bill. Overall, it was a leisurely dining experience in a nice atmosphere, but there were some missteps.\n\nFirst, the menu and prices on the website were different than what we were given in the restaurant. Not a big deal unless you have your heart set on something before you go.\n\nThen, we were served in a weird order. Three of us ordered the prix fixe menu, which includes appetizer, entree and dessert. One friend also ordered a salad and I ordered an oyster appetizer in addition to our prix fixe dinner. \n\nFirst, my two friends got their goat cheese crepe appetizer and I got my oysters. Then, after we ate that, they brought out MY goat cheese appetizer and my friend's salad. I would have thought they would have brought our oysters and salad first, then bring all of the goat cheese appetizers, but whatever.\n\nThe oyster appetizer was simply okay: fried oysters set atop shells containing creamed spinach. The parmesan cheese on top was crunchy and not pliable. Obviously not their signature dish.\n\nThe shrimp and goat cheese crepes were to die for. The crepe was light and tender and the cheese filling was creamy and savory. There was something off with the shrimp though...they were those transparent shrimp, I don't think they were gulf shrimp.\n\nFor my entree, I had the pecan crusted puppy drum. Only certain bites of it were flavorful for some reason. I tasted my friend's chicken and it was terribly dry. I tasted the other friend's barbeque shrimp, it was so delicious, it made me regret ordering the fish.\n\nThe flourless chocolate cake was really good. The servers (all women) were very professional.\n\nMy dining companions and I all dressed up, but there were many diners there in jeans and t-shirts.\n\nTIP: Do not park in the French Market lot behind Cafe du Monde. Muriel's validates for up to 3 hours, so it's very tempting. The lot is dark and isolated and there are not visible security personnel around. When we were going back to our car, there was a guy in an alley, sitting on a bike. As soon as we passed, he pulled out and rode behind us all the way to the entrance of the lot. When we turned right to go to our car, he rode off to the left, and we breathed a temporary sigh of relief. Within two seconds, he made a u-turn and started pedaling to catch up to us. My friend and I RAN to the car and jumped in, and he rode past us, circling the lot. When we got to the ticket booth, we informed the cashier that a man on a bike was lurking around the lot and we asked if they had a security person who could pass through the lot. She acted like she couldn't understand what we were saying and waved us off with a a dismissive, \"Okay, okay.\"  Pay the extra money and park in a more populated, well-lighted area.",

But I tried it.  \n\nI really like restaurants where the quality, service and price are the best features.  I'll bend on the price, for a really good experience.  This, however, was just a decent burger with no drink for $13.  Not a ton of cash for a trendy joint, I know... but again, I want the food and service to stand on its own.  Plus, we ordered to go (at lunch time, but before they got busy) and waited a good 30 minutes for our food.  Just overall not a great first experience, and I'll only go back if it happens to be convenient at some point.  Certainly won't seek it out.\n\nI am teetering on 2-3 stars, but in fairness the burger wasn't bad so I'll give 3.  So like Meh+.",

Probably a local favorite. They set us up at a table where we could sit next to each other as requested. So nice of them to accommodate.  We also brought our own bottle of wine which they charged a $30 corkage fee. A little higher then other restaurants in the area. The food was good. My bf ordered chicken masala. He enjoyed it very much. I ordered the fish special, halibut. It was just ok. A bit over cooked which made the fish taste dry. We followed by ordering two desserts:  affogato caffe and tiramisu.

    "text": "I love Baileys' Range, so when I was in town for just the weekend with 2 of my friends, I insisted that we go there. We had an average wait time (about 30 mins on a Saturday night) which we thought was great. However, upon being seated we waited about 10 minutes before water was even brought to us. And then waited another 10-15 minutes before we were asked what we wanted to drink. We waited about another 10-15 minutes for our drinks (the limoncello is delicious and refreshing for summer). Our food came quickly (maybe 20 minutes after we ordered). It came hot and delicious, but we were missing sauces, out of water and our server was no where to be found. Maybe another 10 minutes after we had gotten our food we were finally provided with more water and out sauces. The food was very good, did not disappoint. After we were done, we waited with our plates for about another 10 minutes before our serve came. We then requested our checks, which is the first thing they brought promptly all night. We got our cards out, then waited another 10-15 minutes before she picked up our checks, which seemed odd to me because typically turn around once you get the check seems to be pretty quick in most restaurants. Perhaps the server was double sat, or new or something, which I could understand the slowness, but the server never apologized for us having to wait on her countless times. \n\nTLDR; the food was excellent as always, but the service was severely lacking on this trip. Honestly bothered my whole dining experience there. Hopefully they do better next time.",

    "text": "Alrighty. I live right next to this place and decided to grab something to eat for lunch there because I felt obligated after being here for half a year just about and I must say that it left so many things to be desired.\n\nFirst off I noticed the hours are just weird. There is no rhythm of reason for the shifting of hours that they do. We'll be open normal hours on Tuesday/Wednesday, but screw around and put Thursday on a totally different time!? To me that makes 0 since, but I'm sure they have reasons.\n\nSecondly, I love to eat whatever and have the God given ability to do as so without gaining any weight. I actually lose weight the older I get. That being said, I don't see how over half of your menu is fried food. I felt like I was working for FEMA again and in some hole in the wall truck stuff where that was my only option. I wanted a lunch portion and my only option felt like it was fried.\n\nFinally has to be the customer service. When I ask what does your \"fully dressed\" come with. Don't say lettuce, tomatoes, and things like that. Everyone does it different. I am not cool with just taking the lettuce and tomatoes off and sticking with the \"stuff like that\" option. I know I can ball park it, but is that mayo? Is it mustard? Do you have something crazy that is unique that you put on there? Sorry I don't go there all the time and have it detailed out.\n\nAs for the good traits that earned this place an average review.\n\nI did appreciate that my \"large\" beer, was actually a huge beer. It was actually a challenge to drink it. The glass was awkward, but all in all it was a hefty challenge for a lunch beer.\n\nI also like the old diner look. When I was growing up, my family would always go to places with this look and it was a warm setting. I would go back and try some of their other options besides fried seafood. Even though they said they add a 18% grat on your ticket, they didn't on mine. That saved them from getting a terrible review as well.\n\nAll in all, I would go back to this place, but it would have to be for diner. I would love to feel nauseated over their batter again, but I think I'm going to have to back off this time.",

I know a dozen people who go there weekly as their neighborhood bar and even they are exasperated by how consistently awful the service is. Good luck getting acknowledged, greeted, served, offered water, given a menu, getting checked up on. It's never excessively busy - they just don't seem to know how a bartender/server is supposed to treat customers. Really, this spot would be amazing if it ever got any people behind the counter who gave a damn about what they were doing.",

    "text": "Went to the newest addition to Japanese food on the north side, early on a Wednesday evening. \n\nIt's nice to have another option in the area, that isn't Sakura or H20, and who doesn't love a restaurant where their \"mascot\" is an octopus dressed as a hibachi chef?\n\nThe decor reminded me of something out of a Sims game - black, red and futuristic, a refreshing style for a city that is often full of stale interior design for restaurants. Lots of fancy LED lighting and a bit of tacky fish oriented decorations too, but, it's nice and comfortable and contemporary.  Even the music playing over the loud speaker was downtempo, providing a \"big city\" feel to the establishment.\n\nWe were greeted instantly, and seated in the dining area, being that we were here for sushi and not hibachi. All the hibachi tables were being used though, either by groups or couples.  They also have a larger hibachi in a private area for large groups.\n\nMy friend had some spicy rolls and really enjoyed them. The presentation was clean and crisp. I had some sashimi and the fish was fresh, generous and delicious. I went to Sakura two days later alone, and the nigiri tasted fishy, when the salmon I had at Tomo was fresh and sweet, as salmon should be. \n\nI also had the shrimp tempura appetizer which featured two very large prawns (biggest I've had in the city!) and a nice mix of veggies. They were tasty as well. \n\nThe service was a bit slow, but, needs were met when requests were made. They also have a somewhat vast (for Japanese) wine list and they make fancy cocktails such as mai tai's. I look forward to trying their hibachi and furthering my menu experience, glad to have Tomo here!",

That said, waiting 20 minutes in line, plus an additional 30 minutes at mule table for a cold turkey sandwich wasn't worth it. Many of their items are cold sandwiches, and considering it takes about 30 seconds to put some turkey on bread and sit it in a plate, it must be a staffing or organizational issue. They appear to deliver orders sequentially, which doesn't seem to make sense here holding up cold items for the occasional hot one. For me it was just over rated and far slower than it needed to be such a basic item.",

    "text": "Brought the kids here for lunch on Easter Sunday.  Glad we came in, but it did fall short of my expectations.  \n\nTeen 2 insisted on onion rings and both girls wanted milk shakes.  Onion rings were giant, good and piping hot with yummy sauce.  They were absolutely dripping in grease though, and there was a large unappetizing pool of grease left on the plate.  Better on the plate than in my stomach, but maybe they could have served them on paper towels or something...\n\nBoth girls ordered brownie milkshakes.  They were delicious, but tiny.  I liked them so much I decided to order a peanut butter one for myself.  The lack of peanut butter flavor was a huge disappointment to me - I have this problem often as I like to be positively smacked in the face with peanut butter taste and many PB flavored things fall short of this.  The shakes were comically tiny for $3.50.\n\nI had the american burger on a pretzel bun.  Meat, mac n cheese, cheddar sauce, and bacon on a pretzel roll.  I didn't love the mac n cheese they used, but the burger was pretty yummy and I couldn't finish it all.  \n\nFries were served cold on the first go-round.  The waitress took them back and replaced them with hot fries without question.  The hot fries were much better and the Teens loved the sauces.  We chose cheddar and rooster sauces.\n\nService was excellent; our waitress was very friendly and we didn't want for anything throughout the course of the meal.\n\nI would try them again, with a different burger and not a milkshake.  Kids liked it though and it was a fun and casual way to spend an Easter lunch.",

    "text": "If you're adventurous in your food-tasting, I guess this would be the place to go.\nI came here during Mardi Gras weekend, and found it (after searching for 30 minutes) in one of the alleyways with very few people dining in. It seemed strange to me, as people on the streets were raging outside, why this restaurant was as deserted as it was. I soon found out the reason.\n\nTHE FOOD was definitely not my cup of tea. We were feeling adventurous and ordered the P\u00e2t\u00e9 of Louisiana rabbit & chicken livers and Pied de cochon\n\"croustillant\" off the Charcuterie section. NOT WHAT WE WERE EXPECTING. Apart from the fact that we did not speak French and had NO idea what we were ordering, the waiter made no attempt to help us despite our questioning gazes. When they arrived, the croustillant turned out to be two small pieces of deep-fried undistinguishable meat (or pig's feet meat, not that we could tell). We couldn't see where the Louisiana rabbit & chicken livers were, but on the other plate was a jar full of questionable jam. We soon found out the \"jam\" was actually the \"p\u00e2t\u00e9\" of the livers. Ech.\n\nTHE SERVICE was pretty absent (or should I say absentminded?). When we first entered the restaurant, the host was talking on the phone with her friend/SO, and even though we stood right in front of her, she kept on giggling to the person on the other end of the phone. It wasn't until a man with a managerial vibe stood behind her that she hung up the phone and showed us to our seats. Our waiter clearly was not really paying attention. He told us he would bring us water with lemons and straws, and it took him 30 minutes to bring just the water, without the lemons and straws (but I guess I must be too picky). When it was time to ring up the check, he brought us a check totaling $100. Um excuse me? No way two deep-fried balls and a jar of pate could cost $100. We had to wait for him to come around to ask him if it was the right check. So in total: \nTime we spent waiting for service = 1-2 hours\nTime we spent eating = 10 minutes\nGet the picture?\n\nTHE ATMOSPHERE was pretty good. Dim lighting gave off a romantic kind of feel. The bookshelves were a nice touch. Made me want to grab a book and start reading it while waiting for service.",

The BBQ Sauce was simple, nothing that blew me away (I've been told it sweet baby rays sauce you can buy at Kroger) The Mac and cheese, ugh okay, and coleslaw was vinegary with ALOT of celery salt.\n\nI tried a sample of my friends potato salad and it was awesome. I would most def get that again. We also got a ooey gooey bar that was so good - full off sugar and butter and Paula Deen Goodness. I would probably go there JUST for the gooey bar. \n\nYounger looking/college age crowd here. Small bar with drinks in mason jars. Service was pretty fast.

It costs me about $30 to lay in an 8 month supply -- coincidentally, the same time interval between my visits to this store.\n\nEach time, the excellent displays beckon and the gently helpful staff members rave about something new I've never tried, and I end up spending another $30 on stuff I really don't need!\n\nI give Whole Foods credit for having the most extensive selection of teas available at any grocery store, so I've made an unscheduled trip or two just to buy tea. The catch? If you buy one of the teas that is available locally elsewhere, get ready to fork out fiftty cents to a dollar more per package to buy it here.\n\nDamn you Whole Foods! You are a bunch of robber barons. Whole Foods ought to create an IRA account for each of its regular shoppers because that's the only way they'll have any money left to retire with after shopping here.",

This time, they didn't charge me for the BURNT PITA CHIPS but gave them to me - over half of which were not even edible compared to the previous trips where I had to ask for them or leave empty handed because they claimed that I paid $1 for 3 extra chips.\n\nFood - The Friday Pasta special is my usual dish. Good blend of lettuce as a salad base with penne. The balsamic sauce was on the side which was great for me. Finally, this past Sunday it was served HOT, not stone cold. In fact, after 30 min of running errands, it was still warm when I got home so it must've been hot.\n\nIf you recognize the name in Birmingham, go to 1 of those locations and get to experience the real Taziki's brand. I leave Nashville in a few months and I definitely hope this location can mimic its great sister locations throughout the South.",

    "text": "So, I'm in Nashville for the weekend with friends and we were looking up places to go to for breakfast in the area. I had already heard about the famous Pancake Pantry and it ended up being the first place that came up when searching for breakfast in Nashville, TN. So, we figured, what the hell, let's try this place...\n\nWe arrived only to find a very large line of people waiting in the hot sun for a nice table to be ready. As we were not prepared to do this at this time, we left, to another restaurant.\n\nDay 2: We arrived again, only to find another very large line... \nDay 3: We arrived once again, and again found a line, but said we need to eat here because it must be absolutely amazing if all these people wait in line every day. \n\nIn line we went (Group of 8) and waited for approximately 25 minutes to be seated. Once we got in, we ordered and waited patiently for our food. I ordered the Chopped Ham in Scrambled Eggs. Somehow, I pictured there would actually be chopped ham in the eggs, but no... it was served in rectangular-diced pieces just above the eggs. The pancakes were served on the same plate as everything else. I personally like syrup on my pancakes but don't like it on my eggs. Thankfully, there was an extra plate on the table and I used that. \n\nMy review: the food was good, but I wouldn't say it was great. Then again, maybe I should have tried some of the other pancakes. I got a bite from the sweet potato pancakes and those were pretty swell. All in all, just a really long wait, which is really not good when you're hungry. Also, waiting to pay at the counter on the way out, not good.",

YES. \n\nxochitl, the RESTAURANT you go to for an impressively cooked meal that is worth the somewhat overpriced expense for mexican food ... NOT SO MUCH.  \n\nthey do serve some of the finest margaritas in the city. they are, as rumored, strong and should be consumed with caution. and the guac, though very high at $9, is incredible. each table has a guac card that you can use to customize the ingredients you'd like to add to your guac, including jalapenos, garlic, tomatoes, peppers, oaxaca, and so many other things. i only say that it's steep at $9 because you don't get much in quantity, but it's fair considering the cost of avocados. \n\nthe food was quite the disappointment.  years ago (before the menu revamp), the food was incredible. i still remember one of the duck entrees i had there as being the best duck i have ever eaten. HOWEVER, the same cannot be said now.  \n\nwe had 2 people in our group order the $26 braised short rib. and they did not even finish it. the meat was dry and a bit bland -  totally tragic. \n\nthe rest of our table had tacos - the carne asada, the carnitas and the fish. these were solid. honestly, there wasn't anything to complain about, but they weren't particularly memorable either. \n\nthe tacos ranged from $13-16 and included 3 tacos. of the ones we tried, i'd say the fish tacos were my favorite. \n\nthis is the upside though. considering the dearth of options fish taco lovers have in this city, if you're having a serious fish taco craving, xochitl is a reliable bet. the fish is not breaded/fried and it tastes very fresh, citrusy and the slaw gives it great crunch.",

With a name like the Prohibition Taproom, and based on a couple of other reviews, I thought they might have good cocktails -- but I was mistaken! My friend's drink -- a rum punch -- was so strong she had to ask them to put more juice in it; and either I'm an alcoholic or they forgot to put any bourbon in my old-fashioned. However, the food was GREAT and once we switched to beer, we were very impressed with their selection of awesome local brews. The bartenders were friendly and accommodating and there was a relaxed, congenial vibe to the place. The one thing to be aware of, though, is that it *is* in a very industrial, out-of-the-way spot -- the desk clerk at the hotel advised us to \"not look like tourists or like we were lost\" while walking there.",

    "text": "Asian Taste Inn in the Huntingdon Valley Marketplace on County Line Road, is a primarily Chinese house owned by a Guangdong Province family, that has been turning out pretty good semi-authentic dishes for a while.  The space is well maintained with many booths and tables, and an amiable server corps dressed in tan and green that actually seems to enjoy interacting with their customers.  \n\nTrue to its cultural roots, the cuisine tends toward sweetness, and even their spicy dishes maintain a hint of sugar just behind the chili flavors.  Our Orange Beef and General Tso Shrimp came either drowned in heavy sweet amber, or had it on the side.  Both were framed in Broccoli Florets, the much overused non-Chinese veggie. Their tastes were fine, but we all commented on the unexpected sugariness of the platters.  The Spicy Shrimp, Scallop & Squid with Pepper Corn Salt, was a relief from the cane, and would have been completely on target had it all been crisper.  Finally, my sushi sample of an Eel & Avocado Roll was average, with much more Avo than Eel, and artificially colored Wasabe and Ginger.  \n\nBottom Line - The suburbs has taken the edge off the kitchen here.  Everything was accommodating to the local market.  Too much broccoli, and not enough real heat. Not bad if this is what you are looking for.",

    "text": "Went here for the first time a few days ago and had lunch. Although it is a chain restaurant, I really liked it. The decor was nice and provided sort of a classy atmosphere. It was not very busy so we were seated quickly but the hostess was not the greatest, basically just handing us some menus and walking away. No explanation of the menu or any specials or anything. Thankfully, our server was very nice and walked us through the menu since we had never been there. While there were a lot of options on the menu for lunch, the prices seemed to be what I would pay for dinner. It didn't seem like much of a lunch special to me. We got our drinks fast and some hot, fresh out of the oven bread that was so yummy, we quickly devoured the whole loaf. My husband got the create your own pasta with the garlic cream sauce with pene, shrimp, and mushrooms. We both agreed that the sauce was a bit of a let down. It was not very creamy or garlicy. Next time he's going to go with the alfredo. I had the meatball sliders with garlic Parmesan fries. The sliders were fantastic. The meatballs were so good, I could have been happy with just a plate of those, but putting them on the buttered buns made them even better, The order comes with three, which was the perfect amount, but the glutton in me wanted more. The fries were ok. They were very thin cut, but could have used a lot more garlic, they were pretty much just regular fries with a bit of cheese on top. Overall, I enjoyed the meal and we plan to go back to try some dinner items and maybe dessert.",

We're here for a long weekend if relaxation & had to come back to Brew Bros for old time sakes. The IPA was very disappointing, it had minimal taste, seemed flat & just not good. Either they've tamed the recipe so beer minions that like tasteless stuff will be happy, or the lines are dirty & need to be cleaned. Thank goodness they have a good whiskey selection so the evening wasn't a loss.\n\nNow to the food. We decided on appetizers instead of meals.

The Basalmic Brussels Sprouts were a total hit - I'd definitely order those little heads of vegetable heaven again. The Burnt Ends were meh & way too fatty. Overall, it was ok, nothing special, nothing too horrible.\n\nUntil we came back later after some gambling & drinking & needing something to soak up some booze. We ordered Garlic Parmesan Fries thinking they would be just what is needed. How disappointing the basket of out of the bag frozen fries were. Even Ore-Ida frozen fries (which are horrible) would have been better. The garlic & parmesan, what little there was, wouldn't even stick to the aweful undercooked & over-starchy excuse for fries.

Some were friendly and others made us feel like we were bothering them by being there.  Our group was not the most quiet group around but it's New Orleans and we dropped over 1500 + tabs at the bar earlier in the evening and we weren't inappropriate in any way, just laughing and having fun with our friends from our industry.  The food was delicious and definitely an A+.  Everyone loved their food (apps, salads, main course, and dessert) and would definitely go back for the food alone.  I just would hope that the next time we are there we are treated with a little more friendly customer service instead of eye rolls.",

I ordered your standard eggs, bacon, and buttermilk pancakes and I was a little underwhelmed.  Dare I say that Cracker Barrel or IHOP would have satisfied my pancake craving better.  I'm thankful that I got to the restaurant right before the crowd started to pick up (I got there around 7:45 am).  The strange thing about eating there are the guys that continuously walk around looking for when you take your last bite - so that they can take your plate.  Kinda puts the pressure on to eat quickly and get up and out.\n\n\n\nBottom line: Decent food (not worth waiting more than 10 minutes for), great service, and prime location.",

Now the rooms in the hotel are not worth paying to stay in one of them. It's too expansive for just a simple old room, not worth it at all !!!

A propane fire pit and amble seating\n\nFood: as Rachel Ray would say, \"delish!\" \n\nDrinks: great flavor, not overly sweet. Very reasonable prices. \n\nService: Here's the downfall. Our server was really nice. I've had her on two separate visits. On my last visit I asked for water when she came and greeted me after I had been sitting for a few minutes. 15 mins later she returned and I asked for water again and a beer. 30 mins into the visit she came with my beer and water. I gulped the water down because it was in the 80's and it took about another 20mins to get a refill. After my group had joined me at the table earlier in the evening, it took about 10-15mins for our server to come over and take their drink order. I was disapointed in the wait times because I did not feel like she was engaged in managing her tables and we would sit with empty drinks while she spoke with her co workers at the bar here and there. \n\nI will likely return because I like the food, and atmosphere so much. However, I'll have to choose when to visit wisely because it will likely be a lengthy process to order based on the speed of service in the past.",

    "text": "It was my last night in the NOLA area, but I didn't want to travel far or pay outrageous prices for a meal. I found Carrabbas on yelp. It was close to where I was staying. My fried and I decided to give it a try, because it could be vegetarian friendly. Well, that does not mean it can be Vegan friendly, as I found out. My server, Rebecca P. was nice enough, but seemed clueless as to what \"Vegan\" means. So, we looked over the menu and I decided on a pasta dish, but I would have to modify it a bit to fit my dietary needs. Rebecca brought us our ice tea and my friend ordered first. Now, I know 'vegan' sounds complicated, but it's not. It's just this, Nothing with a mother and no dairy or eggs. So, I began explaining my dish, but seems Rebecca was not understanding, so I began to explain with my hands, sort of like an Italian might do. Boom! I knocked over my ice tea all over the table. We recovered and moved to another table, while they cleaned up my spill mess. \n\nOk, back to the ordering a Veggie pasta, with red sauce and extra veggies, no meat or dairy. I thought I got that right and that our server understood the order. Hhhhmmm, at least I was hoping that. When it came time to be served, he order was wrong. No extra mushrooms and not a drop of red or marinara sauce. What? Ok, the poor man serving the food, it was not Rebecca, was wide eyed as both me and my friend, in unison, said 'that's not what I ordered.' Our server didn't come by, but Juan the kitchen manager came over and asked me how he could help. he took the dish back to the kitchen, mixed in some red sauce and gave me more on the side. Then, Blake, a floor manager and seems he was serving at the bar too, came by to talk to us. He was pleasant enough too. Now, I think Rebecca was flustered and didn't come by until after that, she asked me if I was being taken care of and that the kitchen, Juan took care of the mixed up order. Yea, it was, but this should have been her job. Rebecca seems like a nice woman, maybe she just needs to understand what 'vegan' entails. Some of us have to eat this way, not just because it a choice, but because it's about health concerns. And, we still want to go out and eat with our friends.  I don't know if it was the kitchen or the server that made the mistake, but you would have thought that with such a harsh start to the meal, then a let down in the middle, a discount or coupon would have been offered.....nothing! So, while we made due; the mess was undone by my standards. I am grateful for the effort, and I would try the food chain restaurant again, but I'll be even more clear on my menu choices and options. Also, It might be wise for this chain to offer at least a couple of Vegan options hot and cold, that are not just appetizers. I'll say this about Juan and Blake, they did their best and went out of the way to make me feel comfortable and welcomed. That's a good way to get repeat business. Next time, offer the customer a $50.00 coupon, that's a way to secure that repeat business. It doesn't need to be for me, just anyone that feels a bit upside down on the menu and service. LOL",

    "text": "Somewhere between fast food and a sit down restaurant, Culvers is a different kind of restaurant concept.  You order at the register and then sit at a table where someone will bring you food.  They focus on quality farm ingredients made when you order so expect a bit of a wait after you order.  The portions are very large and the ingredients definitely a cut above. Expect to pay $8-10 for entree type items like huge hamburgers, loaded roast beef and nice salads with fruit, etc.  Known for their shakes and custard, like ice cream, these items are popular as well.  They are very crowded so expect to wait, but that's OK as it will take you quite a while to read all of the menu options and choose.  :-)    The drive through is an alternate option but still runs a slower than other fast food chains.  The quality wins out though so give it a try and just bring a little patience - its worth the wait.",

So in pursuit of the best burger in Nashville I checked in with my Yelpers. Thanks for your reviews. \n\nThe vibe in the area is amazing!  I will definitely be going back & trying other places.\n\nYada yada I know get to the review right. The service sucked. There was only two tables with people when we got there so why we had to special request water I have no idea. Now, I have my suspicions, but considering we were dressed business casual and the diction in my request should have have debunked any of the false assumptions & stereotypes that may have promoted the lack of service. I must admit it made me appreciate Memphis.  When I get crappy service I know it's just standard, but it feels like its crappy because I  came into the wrong restaurant in the wrong neighborhood  makes me feel some type of way \n\nI digress. The service sucked. We picked the restaurant for the pics & the reviews.  I ordered the 96. The 96 is a blue cheese burger with French fries on top. Sheer nostalgia drew me to this place. It took me make to school lunch when I used to put my fries on my hamburger.  Who could resist a place that intentionally puts the fries on the burger? Now the burger surpassed the Franklin Middle School supreme but it wasn't so spectacular that I would make the 3 hr drive again. We also had the tot fondue...tater tots & cheese sauce, like really really thick cheese sauce. It tasted like they made the roux and went straight to the cheese no milk. My recollection of a fondue sauce is much thinner. But hey, it could have been an off night. We had the pickles in peppers which had either a beer batter or tempura either way it was way too greasy to be enjoyable.  \n\nI had a great time with friends but the food was marginal & the service doesn't really deserve honorable mention. I give it 3 stars for the neighborhood & maybe it was an off night.\n\nThey did let me sign the wall  ....look for PenelopeChristmas",

We'd never been there before and when the fish dish came, we took a few bites before realizing it was pieces of pork belly. It was hard to tell at first due to the heavy colored sauce/ vegetables. When we told the server that neither of us ate pork for religious reasons, the server replaced the dish. However, by then we had lost our appetite.

I tasted its food twice pre-Katrina and found it to be no superior to a Chevy's, Acapulco's or Torito chain restaurant in the West Coast. Today, however, I had the \"pulled pork\" enchiladas (pork was tender and tasty, but was not pulled but chunky) and rice. The rice was average (rice is my weakness, and it's so hard to find a Mexican restaurant that offers passable, let alone delicious, Mexican rice). I asked for a spicy salsa, other than the bland, run-of-the-mill one they so often give you with your chips, and was given a very delicious, spicy one. The queso was abundant and better than I remembered, but still a tad runny for my taste. It is true that good Mexican food is elusive in New Orleans, but other than being a major tourist trap, this place is a good happy hour locale that offers decent Mexican fare for the price.",

    "text": "My guy and I recently started Paleo. After hearing amazing reviews from friends that whose culinary judgement we trust, we decided our last hurrah breakfast was going to be here. We were honestly overwhelmed with our choices and had no idea which route to take. So - he got the breakfast Mexican Sandwich and I got the Biscuit skillet with spicy gravy. We also both got a small mimosa. \n\nLet's start with the mimosa. It was really good, but honestly - it's the size of 3 normal mimosas. And it's served with ice... interesting. Not bad - just interesting. \n\nI tried his breakfast Mexican sandwich. The bread... Ohhhh the bread. It was the better choice of our two selections. Very flavorful and the bread is just - well it's almost croissant like. Almost.\n\nThe biscuit skillet with spicy gravy. Let's start with the gravy. If you choose the spicy option - it just has a little kick. Not a dropkick - so don't be skurrd. It's called the biscuit skillet, but honestly - I detected not one single bite of biscuit. Maybe they crumbled it up for me into teeny tiny little biscuit bits. I don't know. It was basically a skillet full of tasty slop, but I probably won't get it again.\n\nThe atmosphere: We went in on a Sunday for brunch so it was crowded. One of the first things we noticed was that their \"outside seating\" was in the parking lot. No - like... REALLY the parking lot. Just seemed less than restaurant-y. Kind of grimy and dirty... but you get the choice as to whether you want to sit out there or not, so I didn't mark down for that.\n\nWhen we walked inside to wait - there was definitely a line and a LOT of confusion. There was no one taking names, waitresses and host were seating people. We did get seated rather quickly, but there was a lot of apologizing and shifting as we hovered over the table next to the front door.\n\nI'm sure we'll be back at some point - but there was a lot of hype to build this place up and in my opinion, it was good.... Just not OMG!!!",

The location and interior don't suggest to me a great \"night out\" type of Mexican place but it is a good in and out midday stop with decent options. The prices, particularly at lunch, are very reasonable. Seriously, pretty much anything you order off the lunch menu is cheaper than most fast food \"value\" meals. Portions are reasonable though not heavy so it works great for a quick lunch. Staff seem to be friendly and efficient, place is clean.\n\nHowever, I wasn't particularly blown away by anything taste-wise. The salsa was bland, hot sauce options mediocre, rice and beans average. I ordered steak enchiladas and the steak was a bit on the chewy side. The enchilada shells were neither crispy or saturated with flavor, they were just loose and a bit dry so every bite I cut separated all parts--sauce, meat, shell. I don't mean to be overly critical--I did give it 3 stars---because nothing was \"bad\", just not particularly notable. I will certainly try it again and order something different because I'm sure there are some good options on the menu.",

    "text": "Okay, this place is my mother's favorite. And I can definitely taste why. Their curry and coconut infused flavors in their food are REAL authentic Thai ingredients, not that nonsense from a jar. Literally the real deal and no shortcuts. Real Thai food has strong tasting aroma, that's easy to differentiate from easy Thai commercial cuisine. While I did enjoy my Coco ave noodle soup, I kind of felt like there was more to be desired. I wished they gave more soup than a ton of noodles (I just felt like I ate more noodle carbs than anything) because the soup base was fragrant and addicting. For the price of $14-$15 for that big bowl, you think it's worth it. It kind of is... but maybe next time I need to ask for more soup and cut back on the carbs. Then, it would be worth it. I guess I also wish they could have a little more variety and other choices with the food selection. One day, hopefully the menu can expand. Another thing was their price, seemed a slight bit steep on some of the items in the menu. The flavors and authenticity of the ingredients partially make up for that though. Next time I want to try other things for sure.",

    "text": "A friend of mine loved this place and has been there a few times with his wife and visiting children. We went together as he insisted I needed to try it.  I will probably go again but....Well, the place is really nice looking but I was not impressed, so far, with the food. My friend did cut off a piece of the Lamb burger  and that tasted great. But the sack of potatoes, and I am a salt lover, were small boiled and maybe fried with skins little potatoes with WAY TOO much salt. I had the venison corn dog sticks..They were so tough I had to tear the meat apart and all the dough fell off. Somewhat tasty. I gave the rest to my friend. For dessert, I had a piece, a really small piece, a tiny LA portion size of  pecan pie. For some reason, they serve dessert with a spoon. The waitress said the chef demands this.  The spoon, however, would not penetrate the pie crust so I had to ask for a fork...and knife. Each cut took effort as the crust was rock hard. Once,  my friend flinched when the knife suddenly cut through the crust a banged on the plate. Well, the pie was really good, and crunchy. But, when I ordered coffee to go with the pie...they don't have coffee...of any kind. I will try again as it is a cool place in Clearwater which, unlike St.Petersburg, has few cool, hip places",

This is hard to rate because I have eaten at Rangoon and Banana Leaf (Same genre of food... kind of) and out of the three this is my least favorite mainly because the food was mediocre in flavor in comparison and the atmosphere just felt more like a production line versus a nice relaxed place where you can sit and enjoy yourself. It almost felt like they want you in and out in 30 minutes or less so that they can get the next customer in. Put it this way, if I didn't know about banana leaf and Rangoon I would probably rate this place a little higher but the beauty about competition is that you get rated amongst your peers and not in a vacuum. Good food but if you're looking for malaysion type food go to banana leaf.",

    "text": "This is my longest review because the service was pretty terrible so I have a lot to say. \n\nMy boyfriend and I had bought a Groupon for this place in efforts to try something new for our anniversary dinner. This place is cute, small and intimate. We were greeted by a women in a T-shirt which I thought was odd because she was dressed if she was working in a pizza shop and not a restaurant. She sat us down at the table and went over to the computer and tinkered around with it. We assumed she was just the hostess and not the waitress. As we waited for someone to take our drink order, It was enough time that we  read the entire menu thoroughly twice. When we figured out what we wanted the women in the T-shirt was still at the computer  and no one took our drink order yet.  My boyfriend then got up and asked if she was the waitress and she nodded her head yes, so he told her we are ready to order when she was. She then took another several minutes before walking over  with some chips. \nWe both have a gluten allergy and my boyfriend has a vegetable oil allergy. We asked the waitress if the chips were cooked on vegetable oil and explained my boyfriend was allergic. She said she didn't know and just stared at us. My boyfriend then politely asked if she could go check. She informed us are cooked in vegetable oil so of course he didn't eat them. We ordered a chicken fajita and a chicken quesadilla. The menu said have a choice of corn or flour for both items and we asked for corn. Our waitress was very confused as to why I was specifying corn tortillas because she said \"we only have corn tortillas not the flour ones\" I wasn't going to argue because I wanted corn. (At this point she still didn't take out drink order) She placed the order and returned and tell us everything is cooked in vegetable oil... So I asked her if we should leave or do you have any other substitute for vegetable oil and of course she said \"I don't know\" and stared at us. Again, my boyfriend had to asked her to go check for us. At this point I imagine the owner or manager got involved. He said he would cook everything in Olive Oil, and let me tell you the food was delicious! We were pleasantly surprised after the huge headache of being there. After the food came out we still had nothing to drink so we asked the manager if we could get some water and we ate. I can't say enough about how good that Mexican food was!  I got the check and the bill was $30.25 which was perfect because our Groupon was $30 and our card could be charged .25 so we could tip the waitress. (I always tip regardless of the service, some people have bad days) The check came back of wrong, not surprised and she took $25 off our bill so I showed her it's $30 not $25 so I hand her the bill to adjust it and my card to charge me the .25 difference.  She comes back the bill saying it was now $28 and we had no bill after the Groupon. I explained I only had my card and I wanted to tip her even if she did run my card for .25. She stared at us and said \"uhhh, I don't know\" My boyfriend said hey if you can work it out we will tip you but she said not worry about it. I did feel bad but my boyfriend even said, she made the decision on not taking a tip.\nPros- Great environment \n             Great food \n             BYOB \n             Accommodating to food allergies if you asked someone other then the waitress \n\nCons - THE SERVICE. It was enough to not go back unless the manager agreed to let me take own order and personally give it took the cooks. Also help ourselves to some water...because the waitress won't. It's a shame because the food has been amongst the best. It could have been our new favorite place.",

    "text": "Study in contrasts. Went to Kazoku on Wednesday and Sachiko on Friday. Ordered same dinner for fair comparison: chicken teriyaki, nigiri, sashimi for $18.95. Chicken was definitely not stored at right temperature; tasted strong off note immediately. Nigiri: sake, maguro, ebi, and hamachi not as fresh, firm as Kazoku's. Sashimi: two pieces of sake, three of maguro; all smelled fishier than one would expect, and taste aligned with smell. Not good. Dinner came with miso soup, iceberg & shredded carrot salad, and potato salad. Overall, meh at best. Not as bad as I've had in places such as Bowling Green, KY (really should have known vetter), but not worth going out of your way for. Of course, I ordered a cheap combination that doesn't show an expectation for the restaurant's best nigiri or rolls; one might expect low-quality off-cuts for such a combo. If that's the case, then that's why I'm giving three stars rather than one. Caveat emptor, to be sure.",

    "text": "Ralph's on 9th Street just off Christian has been a Philadelphia landmark for over one hundred years. While 9th street has been a part of my life for as long as I can remember I have never eaten at Ralph's.  Now, I must say from the start, that Ralph's is the kind of Italian restaurant that I avoid. Ralph's is an old time, red sauce kind of place: the kind of Sunday macaroni and gravy that I grew up on. But these days, I suppose I have grown beyond it. Having lived and studied in Italy back in the 70's, I experienced lighter, cleaner flavors in Italian foods. When I came home I introduced my family to these recipes. That was the end of the red sauce tradition in our house. The same reformation was happening in kitchens and restaurants across the country. This was the era of Julia Child and the great culinary awakening. Restaurants like Ralph's were old school. The wonderful film \"Big Night\" lyrically illustrates the two worlds: meat balls and spaghetti vs. shrimp risotto.\nRecently an episode of Lydia featured Philadelphia and a trip to Ralph's. Lydia's enthusiasm for Ralph's traditions sparked a bit of guilt and regret. As an Italian American I had rejected and neglected long held culinary traditions. As a Philadelphian whose great -grandparents settled on 9th in Christian in 1885, I had ignored and concealed my history. I owed Ralph the respect of their kitchen.\nRalph's is a rather small space. Tables are close together, perhaps too close. You can hear almost every conversation in the room: some conversations not necessarily appropriate for dining. The room is very dark, but immaculately clean. The wait staff, all men, sharply groomed and attired in black, greets and serves with the utmost friendliness and attention: perfectly traditional Italian.\nWith menu in hand we carefully scanned to find the balance between traditional heavy red sauce and lighter fare. As we scanned the selections we also watched what was coming from the kitchen. No small number of dishes were bowls or narrow plates of red gravy that completely obscured whatever lay beneath. This was not the direction we wanted to go. Lydia highlighted the Chicken Trombino. So, that was our first pick. The reason for her choice became clear when the dishes arrived. The giambotta of egg, sausage and chicken looked promising. Although I knew giambotta as an eggplant and squash dish this version with egg merited investigation. For our third dish we went for the veal with peppers and mushrooms.  As a starter we ordered a cup of the\" pasta fazool \"(pasta e fagioli.) As usual, if you read my other reviews, we would share our lunch. Requesting the waiter to bring extra plates for sharing is never a problem.  I suggest it strongly.\nThe minestra, the \"pasta fazool,\" warmed our chilled 9th street shoppers' bones. In many ways, the soup is the indicator of a good restaurant. If the cooks are attentive to a simple soup, you know they will be attentive to the main courses. Ralph's rich and creamy bean soup hit the mark. \nThe main courses arrived in properly measured time. We began with the giambotta. As I mentioned, giambotta as I knew it was something of an eggplant and squash stew. Ralph's version is what I would call a frittata. The portion was large and an easy share for three people. The sausage and chicken enriched each bite. But, there was one element that recalled the old style: green peppers. Green peppers tend to be course and biting. While they were a staple in recipes in my childhood, I no longer use them.  They have been replaced by fully ripe red or yellow or orange peppers.\nWe then moved to the veal. For the three of us at the table, this was not an easy dish The veal was heavily coated in red sauce and green peppers. It was just too strong. Nonetheless, I must say that this was exactly how my mother would make it when I was a child, and why, even as a child, I didn't care for it. The veal arrives with a side of spaghetti in red sauce. The spaghetti was cold and the sauce too heavy for my taste. \nOur last entr\u00e9e, the Chicken Trombino, was suggested by Lydia and I can see why. The Chicken Trombino is not a traditional Italian American dish. This recipe is clearly something from a different inspiration. There is no heavy red sauce. The full chicken breasts are served with clean, fresh chunks of tomato and seasonings. The Chicken Trombino , in its light preparation, is what I prefer in Italian cooking.\nIt is very difficult to give a rating to Ralph's. Clearly, Ralph's offers foods with an Italian American history more than 100 years old. What they do, they do well. The restaurant is small but meticulous. The staff is elegant and affable. The service is prompt and the food well prepared in its own style. For many, Ralph's is a rich and hearty experience of old time Italian American food in new world. For me, Ralph's is an excursion to the past. But, is it really a past that I wish to recall?",

I recommend packing a big, rolling suitcase full of food and beverage to take to your hotel room, (and it will be a HIKE!) but it will save you mega bucks.  You will pay $8.00 for a Bud Light here.) I wish I had paid extra for a room with a balcony, and had smuggled in some food, and could people watch while pre-gaming!\nI enjoyed the sushi and service at Wasabi. I had a TERRIBLE $7 breakfast biscuit from Conservatory Cafe. Also I was not impressed with Sheldon, the front desk manager who made my check in more difficult and lengthy than it had to be. \nPlace was decked out for the Holidays, glad I visited  in December.",

It's very close to going on that list of foods that I'd want at my last meal.  I had the bangers n' mash the last time I was there, and was extremely happy with them.  The pork sausages were perfectly cooked, and packed with deliciousness.\n\nService is good, and the only reason I dinged them a star is that their beer selection is really, really small.  They're not putting on airs about being a world class beer bar, but frankly, they're just lacking in this department.  They've got Guinness, and a couple other good beers, but six or seven beers doesn't really cut it, anymore.  Bump up the draught beer list, or get a decent bottle selection, and then I'll bump you guys back up to four stars.",

Maybe I heard wrong.\nThe place is quite an attraction, I'll give it that.  It's almost like you're visiting Disneyland's Frontierland.  We went during lunch time so the atmosphere was more casual and rustic.  I do hear that during dinner, it is more romantic.  \nThe drive to this location is quite scenic and windy up into the hills of Santa Barbara.  And the place is tucked away alone all by itself off a side street.  During the Sunday lunch period, it's a frequent stop for Harley riders.  It can get super duper crowded cause the space is quite limited.\nWe ordered the Beef Dip sandwich and the BBQ Babyback ribs, plus their famous chili.  All the dishes were very good.   Definitely better than average.  \nI would recommend it just for checking it out at least once for lunch, and once for dinner.  But other than that, it's okay.",

The menu has plenty of tasty options that aren't too pricey. I ordered the Marathon Breakfast which is a great option if you want some bang for your buck. It came with one two egg omelet, toast, potatoes and two pancakes. Pancakes on the larger side and very tasty. Toast a little too crisp but the eggs and potatoes just right.

They do eat-in or take out, and I hear they do delivery but I'm not certain. \n\nI ordered the chef sauce noodle, and while it was decent it just didn't seem ~$9 good which is what you end up paying after tax. The dish was mostly noodles, lacking much of anything else. The sauce, meat, and green onions were practically condiment portions, but still managed to leave a large pool of oil/grease at the bottom of the container they were placed in. I put more sriracha on stir fry that already has sauce on it. The noodles were decent but nothing to write home about, and for all I know could've been bought from a store. \n\nThe people running the counter were nice but for lunch time with no one in the restaurant when I arrived, service was pretty slow (I got mine to go). \n\nOverall, Kung Fu Noodle isn't bad, its just okay. With China Pasta House being only 10 minutes away with higher quality, quantity, homemade, and cheaper noodles + potstickers, I have hard time thinking I'd choose this place first. \n\nWorth a try, I'd take it over Americanized Chinese food any day, but the prices are a bit steep for what you get.",

With the help of our waiter I was able to customize by combo of beef, mixed veggies and ginger for $13.95. Entree comes with a side Tom Kha soup or salad. I could tell the soup was well made, I'm just personally not a huge fan of the taste of fish sauce and coconut milk mixed...ha, should have ordered salad. Anyway, the rest of the food was okay. Again, well prepared, but lacked a bit of seasoning. The American in me added salt and pepper, but I think it needed something else. Filling and healthy nonetheless. On another visit I would order something else. I did really enjoyed the shrimp roll that came along with the combo. I believe it was like a fried rice roll. I wasn't crazy about the egg roll. \n\nThe hot ginger tea was very nice and soothing for a cool Santa Barbara evening. It was a bit chilly, so upon request our waiter turned on the outdoor heaters for us which was nice touch. Everyone in my party seemed to enjoy their meals.

    "text": "I have been to the Carollwood location many times and I was looking forward to the opening for months since I found out in July since this location is closer to me. Starting with a positive. The food was great! However, the criticisms come from the moment I walked into the restaurant. A server who was at the desk completely ignored us as we entered. A young man with no sense of urgency came from across the room where he was seated playing with his phone. We were seated. Our server was actually at our table within minutes but, like I read another review, did not have much of a personality. We ordered food as I was noticing other customers entering. They were also not seated quickly even there seem to be plenty of staff. This happened a few times. The restaurant was filling up quickly and there seemed to be a dispute and confusion about which servers were assigned to which tables. I witnessed at least 2 parties wait at least 5 minutes before a server came to greet and get drink orders. My final complaint is that my waitress forgot an important detail in my order and I was forced to wait too long watching my mother eat her food before I got my breakfast. I do hope that with a little training and good management that service will improve. Sincerely.",

As a vegetarian there are not many options on the menu and I avoided the rice and beans just to be on the safe side.  The waitress and the folks I spoke to on the phone were a bit confused when I asked if the beans and rice were vegetarian so it was better to be safe than sorry.  I was able to sub mexican corn or fresh veggies which was a nice option to have.  Shoulda gone for the veggies as it was just plain, bland corn.

    "text": "Tried this out for lunch yesterday. Let me start by saying the food was good. I had three tacos--Mahi Mahi, pollo, and carnitas.  They were deliciously prepared and the (what I presume to be) homemade sauces provided great extra flavor. They also have Boylan's fountain soda which is really just to die for. \n\nAnd now, the airing of grievances (Seinfeld style):\n\n1. The tacos are pretty small considering the price (about 4 a pop). I guess that might be so you can sample a selection of the offerings but no one wants to feel they're not getting any bang for their buck. \n\n2. It doesn't seem like there's enough seating to accommodate a lunch crowd. The turnover was fast enough and it wasn't an issue for my crew of four but I could def see it being a problem. \n\n3. There's at least one discrepancy on the menu (tecate is either $2 everyday or $4.50 depending on where you see it) that annoys me because I think pricing should be straightforward and clear. It just seems to me the error allows for a loophole of charging customers more if they're not looking closely. \n\n4.  Lastly, the power situation. While we were there yesterday, there was a power outage. I'm in no way blaming that on Buena since it appeared to cover a few blocks in the surrounding area but, the way it was handled by the staff left a lot to be desired. Namely, they just said \"sorry folks\" and watched as diners attempted to wait it out or customers who hadn't placed orders yet filed out. I would've expected some sort of customer retention effort. After about 10 min of no power (windows allowed plenty of daylight to see), no updates, and increasing heat since the air conditioning was off, we left, too. \n\nTake away:: a good option if you're looking for a bite in the area, are not committed to eating in their dining area, and bring your reading glasses.",

Sometimes it feels like the staff runs the restaurant and the managers are just along for the ride (lots or arguing and bickering in the corner). Never tried the salad bar but it seems popular and always stocked. The concept is old and dated trying to re-invent itself...not sure how that's going though. Overall, just average casual dining chain. The highlights are late night happy hour drinks and apps but then again...there's not much in Gibsonton :)",

We quickly got seated but it was confusing because there were a lot of empty tables that for some reason we were not allowed to sit...(they didnt  seem reserved). \n\nMost importantly, we were not very impressed with the beers my first visit and the same holds for the second visit. My friend and I sampled all the of the beers and overall all the beers seemed unnecessarily bitter (I admit I am biased and am not in love with overtly bitter beers) and lacking in flavor. I don't think any of the beers tasted like the description listed. I did enjoy their malt whiskey beer (?) -- it actually tasted more like a mixed drink than a beer. All in all, the beers paled compared to nearby breweries like Evil Genius and St Benjamins.  \n\nTheir Rose pizza was delicious but the fries were left in the fryer for too long and not seasoned at all. Also, the beer cheese sauce addition was 2 dollars! which seemed like a bit much....",

We heard good things about Landry's and made a reservation for 8pm. \n\nUpon arrival, we were seated immediately at a table in between two large parties with lots of children. No offense, but it's ladies' night and we need to swear and act like fools in a semi-private location. No one was on the patio so they accommodated our request to move outside.\n\nOur server sat us and promised to return with some water and the wine/ cocktails we had ordered. He didn't come back for almost ten minutes!! BUT the wine and cocktails were awesome so we got over it. We ordered an appetizer:  Shrimp, stuffed with crab and wrapped in bacon. They were absolutely to die for... I mean right up there with ... well, you know. After the appetizer, our bread and salad came out. The salad was in a large bowl with tongs so we could all share it. I had two small salads out of it and there was still plenty to go around. The dressing was outstanding. The bread was smothered in a garlic butter and also... to die for.\n\nLobster tails were served (yes, we all ordered the exact same thing) with loaded baked potatoes. Lobster was cooked nicely and potatoes were huge! I was super pleased with everything until we ordered a second bottle of wine and stepped out front to smoke a post-dinner cigarette. When we returned, our table was cleaned but our new bottle of wine was gone!!!!!!!! We panicked that they had thrown it away and we were right! The busser thought we had left and took out our full bottle of wine! SERIOUSLY!? Crazy town. \n\nSo the food was really good and the ambiance was nice, sitting by the lake. Service could definitely use a step up as there were several long periods of time without seeing our server.",

I tasted no papaya as was described on the menu and although pretty, the lived carrots on top tasted like nothing and didn't add to the dish.

Obviously, not required to memorize orders unless Thursday was her last night of employment, but I doubt it.\n\nIf she checked on us, she failed to make it apparent. The bartender was worse. The top shelf margarita was so tart it was unbearable to drink. Making matters worse, he screwed up my vodka tonic. Two ingredients, people...I don't know how this was possible. We didn't receive any water and our server seemed to have more tables outside as she was never in sight. That's the only reason we drank as much as we did of those poorly made $10 drinks. Less than half was consumed and she never noticed.\n\nBased on my visit, I recommend the nachos, roasted pork quesadilla and the crab cakes - which are humongous! Only order drinks from a bottle.",

    "text": "Went last night for dinner. We had not been there since the casual makeover. I like that the place has opened up, they knocked the wall that separated the bar from the dining area down. I also like that the prices have been lowered. \n\nWe had early reservations and were seated promptly. Our server was very eager and a little awkward, but at least the effort was there. \n\nWe started with the guacamole made table-side, which was delicious and fresh. We also had the queso fundido with chorizo and it was addictive! \n\nThe entrees were a let down, however and that is why I cannot give more stars. At fairly steep prices, compared to apps, I expected greatness. We had the fried chicken with rice and it was bland atop some gummy rice concoction. Just meh. We also had a seafood special that was equally uninspired. \n\nI agree with Meghan C. that the margaritas do pack a punch and they are not too sweet, which was good for me. They also have some great Mexican beers on draft - my husband enjoyed a few Negro Modelos. \n\nOverall, I think this would be a great place for drinking and snacking, but the entrees are to be missed.",

PROS: the delicious French Onion soup. CONS: I guess my main concern was the itty bitty crab cakes I ordered. Paying the price that I did for that small of an order of crab cakes is RIDICULOUS. At the Chophouse in Charleston, for that price I received a crab cake the size of my face! Someone in the group ordered a filet that wasn't cooked to medium perfection. The sea bass my friend ordered looked pretty good, but I tasted his au gratin potatoes and they were  completely underwhelming. My friend also ordered the Chicken Piccata which tasted fine.

    "text": "I've only become recently acquainted with the dining options in the Northwest neighborhood of Nashville called German-town. 312 has been one of my first experiences, along with a couple others. I've heard rave reviews, and seen some negative ones as well. My experience was not bad, but not good either.\n\nI stopped in for a quiet lunch time on a Friday, and sat at the bar. The bartender got my order right away, and I waited ten minutes for two slices of pizza. There were two different ones, but I don't remember what they were called. I do remember the crust was awesome! Spot on! Nice crunch on the outside with that perfect soft dough within. It was drenched in tomato sauce, which I could have cared less about if there were more toppings on the pizza. That's where it went wrong. The veggies (mushrooms, peppers, etc) all tasted incredibly fake. Just not a good quality. I didn't feel it lived up to the rest of pizza at all. So on the pizza end, I do believe I can find better in Nashville.\n\nThe inside vibe is not bad at all. Sports bar, a little more upscale. Not perfectly cleaned, as I could see where it was wiped down on the bar by way of the streak marks. Not my style, but hey, it's not the biggest deal.\n\nI would be curious to see what it is like during a busier time. Overall, it isn't a bad pizza place, but not one that I prefer.",

The cooks are all out in the open so we watched them after we ordered our food. \n\nThe only big complaint I have was the Bloody Mary. It was the one with the raw oyster in it. Oyster was delicious but the drink itself was God awful. Maybe bc I'm used to thicker tomato based bloody Mary's where this one was a carbonated, citrusy beverage. I wasted $10 bc I couldn't even tolerate choking it down. \n\nBetter notes...the food:)\nGlazed bacon... Very fatty buuuut thick cuts and the parts we could eat were amazing. \n\nPistachio donuts served with a light cr\u00e8me and a few small orange slices were so delicious! They literally melted in your mouth. \n\nThe liege waffle: my favorite item we ordered! Very light and fluffy. Served with whatever syrup was not too sweet and not drenched either. Served with 2 perfectly crunchy pieces of bacon and nuts sprinkled on top of the waffle. So good!\n\nThe Viking patti melt: perfectly cooked(a little pink inside) served with crispy French fries. The one and only complaint I had about this was the salt. They add salt onto the patti before they cook it... I would ask them to hold the salt if you decide to order this. I was on the verge of a stomach ache after eating 2 bites of this.\n\n5 hours later... My stomach has been kind of messed up all day. Not sick but just unsettled. I'm on a plane right now so hoping nothing happens. My boyfriend just informed me that he's been stuck in the bathroom for the past 30 minutes. We had high hopes for this place:/",

I've been here on 3 different occasions and have found the menu to stay almost completely the same, with very limited options. \n\nI've tried the steak, the burger, and the soft shell crab BLT. Out of those 3, the burger was the best, because a burger can never be that terrible. The steak as I recall was just decent and lacked much taste. Last night I tried the soft shell crab blt. It was definitely a beautiful presentation, but there was way too much going on in regards to taste. It was sweet and salty, which tasted weird. There was some sort of bbq sauce on it that completely ruined the dish in my opinion. It was also overpowered by lettuce. The French fries here are completely mediocre too. \n\nI also ordered one of their special drinks. The drink was extremely strong and difficult to even put down. \n\nSo, why 3 stars? Service was damn good. And their raw bar is unbelievable. Some of the best oysters I've had.",

Our room was clean (a little on the smaller side, especially for the price we paid), but we stayed in Magnolia, which is such a HIKE to the rest of the hotel. I wouldn't mind walking everywhere if I actually knew where to go.\n\nThis brings me to my next point- the hotel staff is not properly trained in guest relations. I had just gotten to my room and needed directions to a Delta ballroom, so naturally.....I called the front desk. I let the attendant know that I had recently checked in and needed step by step directions to get to the Delta Ballroom area. She simply told me \"Go to Delta and turn left....thank you have a nice day!\" and hung up on me.....I mean, SERIOUSLY? That kind of customer service is unacceptable. If I'm paying over $200 a night to stay at this hotel....the least the hotel staff could do was give me proper directions. I ended up wandering around and asked a very kind food staff employee where the ballrooms were and in his broken English he gave me step by step instructions......it's not even their job to provide directions to guests, but that employee gave me more instructions than the front desk ever did.\n\nAlso....why do I have to pay $23 for parking? This place is nowhere near downtown Nashville so be prepared to drive around if y'all wanna do some sight-seeing.\n\nIf you are staying at this hotel......find a cheaper hotel.....this one is NOT worth your money.....The plants are nice to see for 15 minutes....I guarantee you'll be spending much longer than that wandering through this maze of a poorly-staffed \"resort\"",

Their rendang however doesn't match my tastebud. Their Indian mee goreng is so good! Also I have a little trouble with the peanut sauce that they serve, it's too sweet. Their coconut rice is just like regular white rice. Their service isn't the best for me but still okay. Probably clean the place a little bit more?

    "text": "My friend and I happened on this place while walking my dog through the neighborhood. They had 1 outdoor table so we decided to sit. We were lingering and sitting for several minutes before anyone came out - we were actually wondering if they were even open on a Saturday afternoon because it is a very dark looking place. The waitress finally came out. We had been lured in by the menu spread open on said sidewalk table - specifically, the coconut hush puppies and mezze plate. I also wanted coffee. Unfortunately, they were only serving their brunch menu which included neither of those things. It, in fact, consisted only of 1 page of entre\u00e9s, no small plates and nothing really sharable. Oh yes, and it would be a 20 minute wait for coffee \"because they use a percolator\". Luckily, Gosling's was on the drink menu, which had several interesting N/A beverage options, to my delight. I ordered one of those, a white/green tea blend, my companion got a cherry lemonade and the vegetarian breakfast burrito with black beans sans avocado. Despite the rough start, the meal was yummy - I loved the cilantro mashed potatoes inside the burrito but found the Honduran cheese to be a little overly creamy for my palate (I'm not a big cheese person). I would like to go back to eat the dinner menu items I had picked out first. Will give it another shot since it's within walking distance although not overly enthusiastic about this spot.",

Fulton area is just fun in general most times, the Alley is an awesome addition.  Just be mindful of the hours are limited for the under age 18 crowd.\n\nGood bar foods:  we had wings, burgers, fries.  Served hot, didn't appear to be too processes.  Good family fun in NOLA.",

Coffee? Yes please! I whipped out my Yelp app and found that Kave Express had great reviews so off I went. The prices are great and they have two drive-up windows for speedy service. I ordered a cappuccino and it was yummy! I'll be honest, the tip jar threw me off. The entire transaction was so quick that I barely noticed the jar until the last second. In that one second my mind was thinking \"wait a minute, Starbucks doesn't have tip jars. Should I tip or not?\" and \"what the...I don't even carry cash. Are they going to think I'm cheap if I drive away without tipping?\"  I felt pressured by the tip jar.",

Since we were in a bit of a rush we ordered the lettuce wraps and some dumplings. 10 minutes later she came to make the Changs sauce and paid attention to how we wanted it flavored. Some servers just kinda do their own thing when it comes to how much mustard and pepper goes in it. The wraps and dumplings came out and I was a tad disappointed to see that the dumplings were mostly breading with a tiny bit of meat inside, I realize they are mostly breading to begin with, however this was nuts.

Nary a vegetable on the kids menu so had to order off the regular menu for my kids and when I ordered my 3 YO daughter a whole milk the waiter brings it out in an open GLASS cup without a straw in sight.  It was brunch and there was one other table that Presidents Day morning.  Yet our food took quite a while to come out. It was sitting on the counter for a several minutes being discussed under 4-5 different staff people.  It's pretty clear they don't \"get\" kids here.  My huevos rancheros were average, certainly not worth $18; my husbands monte Cristo was good.  It was our one brunch meal in Philly so had wanted it to be a good one - wish I had gone elsewhere.",

    "text": "First understand how the \"Endless Sushi and Hibachi Eatery\" menu works. If you are starving you will die before you get enough food in your stomach to quell the pains. There is no \"bar\" to walk up to and select food from. You place your order from the special menu one dish at a time. The Sashimi is limited to eight pieces per person and its thin slices of fish with no rice. It was gone in seconds then i had to wait for the waitress to come back and take my next micro order of food. So the deal here is to make you wait 15 minutes between dishes so you either feel full or get tired of waiting. The policy is you must finish one dish before you can order another. Its an effective system to reduce consumption by dragging out the order process. \nSushi - a little warm for my comfort level. \nPortions - sashimi is super small, the rolls were 4-6 pcs depending\nOverall - its good but not if your starving. Your better off ordering off the regular menu.",

My friend got the Philly Steak and said it was pretty good. We shared the sweet potato fries with the sriracha ailoi which was really good! Space is very limited for seats and my friend sitting on the shared bench was being moved every someone got up or sat down, kind of annoying. The staffed seemed nice but kind of impatient.

    "text": "Maynards quickly became a Tucson hotspot.  The ambiance, both food and drink menus, and commitment to local meats and produce all impress, but I found both the service and food to be hit and miss.  \n\nFor a small meal, the mussels in white wine can be great.  However, on a number of occasions the mussels were fishy and inedible.  I sent them back and asked when they arrived at the restaurant; it was nearly a week before the waiter set them in front of me. No bueno.\n\nThe Raclette was not memorable.  Their meat choices were good, but no better than I could find at many other restaurants (or AJ's) in town. I did not care for the pickles.  I enjoyed the roasted beets on several occasions.  They were cooked perfectly; the natural sugars transformed them into crispy treasures.  \n\nIf you're ordering cheese, I recommend the Humbolt fog (goat's cheese that resembles brie coated in chevre), Beemster (yellow, aged), and Idiazabal (a hard sheep's milk).  The current jelly served with the fromage is great on the Basque sheep's milk cheese, or alone.  \n\nA friend ordered the Choucroute Garnie and liked it, but others in the party commented that the sausages were nothing to write home about.  \n\nI once decried that the Bouillabaisse at Maynards was the best in town, but recently it was severely disappointing.  The once rich and decadent broth is now greasy and lacking in flavor.  In my last bowl, the mussels and scallops were overcooked, and there were only 2 pieces of onion.  I will not order this again, or at least will wait to taste someone else's to make sure the quality improved. \n\nThe macaroni is okay, a bit greasy and over salted.  \n\nMy favorite menu item is the potato pizza.  SOOOOOO good.  It's comprised of thin slices of Yukon golds over a perfectly cooked crust and garlic sauce.  Shaved green onions, rosemary, and Fontina make this the most memorable thing on the menu.  \n\nThe mushroom pizza is also fabulous.  The arugula, goat cheese, and roasted garlic complement the mushrooms, which do not loose center stage on this dish.\n\nOther great dishes:\nCassoulet\nPork Belly\nBraised Beef\n\n\nService is slow.  The noise level is high. And the rotating menu does not highlight enough seasonal fruits and veggies. The wine choices are great, and the signature drinks are good.\n\nI wish you were more consistent Maynards, you have great potential.",

    "text": "Been coming here since I was a little girl and they have amazing Greek food. The food gets 5 stars, but service brings the overall rating down to a 3. A year ago I went in with my mom and we ordered a Greek salad for two. A waitress immediately interrupted my mother and I and asked us if we were sure we wanted the bigger salad because the two of us probably could not finish it. At first I was taken aback by such a comment as it is not the waitresses/waiters job to tell me what I should and should not order. However, it never happened before so I didn't make a big deal out of it. All was well, until I went back again with my mother yesterday. Like always, we ordered a Greek salad for two. I proceeded to continue with my order and as I was stating I wanted a chicken souvlaki, the waiter didn't even let me finish before he said well if you are going to order more food maybe you shouldn't get the bigger salad. It'll be too much for you two to finish. Okay, are you kidding me? Is this a rule in this place? A rule that says you need to tell customers how much food is enough? This isn't alcohol we're talking about, you can't cut me off of food. The salad is not even big when split between two people. It is disrespectful that the waiters and waitresses are even making suggestions like that. It is rude, and mind you I'm paying for a bigger salad rather than a small one. Larger bill=larger tip. Better service=better tip. Simple as that. If I get asked this one more time, I might be convinced that it is a rule to tell people how much food is enough in this place. \n\nP.S. some people enjoy leftovers.",

I enjoyed a drink at the bar while we waited, where we watched one of the chefs bottle up the homemade pickles.  It was both a strange and delightful way to pass the time.  When we were seated, we ordered promptly, though waited a little too long for our food to arrive.  I guess because our party was considered large?  When the food arrived, I enjoyed the quinoa and black bean burger, though found myself wishing it was grilled or sauteed rather than deep fried.  I also paid an upcharge for a grilled sweet potato specialty side, though sent the side back because the sweet potatoes were still hard when I bit into them.  When the waiter returned with the sweet potato FRIES found on the menu, I was delighted by their crispy outsides, tender insides, and perfect degree of saltines.\n\nA few weeks later, I was visiting a friend in the 12th South area, and we ordered the turkey burgers, which were good, but nothing special.\n\nI don't think I'd come to the 12th South area only to visit Burger Up, though I'd stop by again if we're in the neighborhood and craving a decent burger.",

Caveat it was fairly busy at the time, and the server was friendly and I'm assuming if we'd asked they would hopefully have had a microwave to heat it back up; but by the time the food arrived we really wanted to just eat and get going.\n\nWe got the chicken tenders on sweet potato waffle and the crawfish etouffee on grits. The etouffee especially would have probably tasted a lot better at least warm.\n\nFelt for the level of service the prices were high, particularly the beverages.",

    "text": "I came here to eat dinner tonight and I was not impressed at all.  First off, the waiter was going through the menu with me telling me where I should order.  I didn't even get a chance to look at the menu nor did I ask him for help which I thought was odd.  I felt I was being forced to order from their dinner menu.  I politely thanked him and proceeded to order what I wanted to order.  My husband ordered the wanton noodles with duck.  The reason for the 3 stars is because the wantons were amazing.  The broth was so bland though which was a bummer.  I ordered the baked pork chop with fried rice.  It's kind of strange because it's pieces of pork chops with spaghetti sauce baked with cheese over rice.  Seriously I could have done without the spaghetti sauce.  A very odd mix.  I think they should have written that in their description.  The soft shell crab was definitely plentiful but it just tasted strange to me.  It seems like they mixed peanut butter in their batter.  It's really dark in color and did not taste right.  I hate leaving bad reviews so I may try them out once more to update my review in the future.",

In return, all I ask is decent coffee and friendly service. I know it's gonna be busy. I know I'm gonna wait.... Throw me an apologetic smile or something once in awhile. \nSo when I went over the weekend and waited 20 mins only to get completely dismissed by the barista when I asked for her help in figuring out why I was so waiting for croissants, I was thoroughly disappointed.  When I apologized for interrupting HER and kindly asked if she could help, she offered nothing and said to me \"oh i don't do warming station, my shift supervisor does.\" And that was it, you can imagine my frustration.  I hate leaving a bad review but she didn't even yell for someone. Or point to someone. Or anything. Not cool. \nSo when I did find my person, she said the ticket never printed then walked away. Then 30 seconds later came back with a bag of my food. She said it was accidentally left at the drive thru window. The end. It had been sitting there for awhile..and I'd been waiting for 20 mins. \nFrankly, I want to give a lower star but because I received excellent service from a kid the day before who normally worked at a different store... The Starbucks gets an average.. \n\nDo better. It isn't difficult to be cool.",

Tap list is very impressive and they run great specials (like 3 dollar pint night). However, when it comes to the burgers it leaves much to be desired. I ordered the pbbj which was very unique. It has peanut butter and strawberry jam, cheese candied bacon and strawberry slices. I am not a fan of pork so I had to x that from my burger. It was a pretty good burger , mostly because of the pb&j. The burger itself was somewhat bland and dry. The fries were pretty good however somewhat over cooked.

But, don't fret, it goes by really fast. Inside there is a wall full of pads of paper and pencils where you write what you want to eat and drink, so once you're up at the cashier, you just hand them the paper and the cash. And the food is out in like 5 minutes. There's seating inside and outside. It's a really fun, busy atmosphere.\n\nAs for the food-- it's just ok. We had the steak fajitas, chicken fajitas, and pulled pork fajitas. The meat itself in the pulled pork wasn't really flavorful. But the steak and chicken were pretty good. You have to pay a few cents extra for extra ingredients. We paid an extra 25cents for each fajita to add green peppers and onions, which made the fajitas taste a bit better. There's also a small salsa bar- and by small, I mean there are only 2 fresh salsas to choose from, which are good, especially added to the fajitas.\n\nPrices are decent. Food is ok. Fast service.

    "text": "Not being local, we relied on recommendations from our Indianapolis based colleagues for dinner recommendations and actually wound up dining at Stone Creek twice in a three day period. \n\nOur first visit:\nA party of four on a Wednesday night for an early dinner - around 6PM. We were seated in the bar and got our menus immediately. We looked them over and made our choices and then waited for the waitstaff to return to take our orders. We made conversation while waiting longer - almost 30 minutes in total. It was the same story once we ordered our entrees...unfortunately they were short staffed and had only one person handling the entire bar area. \n\nThe food was quite good - the house salad is large and the vinaigrette dressing is top notch. For an entree, I ordered the mushroom- goat cheese strudel and It. Was. Excellent. I highly recommend this dish to anyone. The pastry was flaky, the mushroom/cheese filling was well melded and the butternut squash tender. A total hit.\n\nOur second visit:\nWe had a party of six on a Thursday night, again for an early dinner around 6PM. We were seated quickly and the service level was absolutely on point. Unfortunately, I ordered the pork chop with cous cous and asparagus and found that the chop was cooked too long...it was dry and stringy, to the point that I ate less than half. The cous cous and asparagus were both excellent. \n\nStone Creek has a good wine and beer selection and the menu shows innovation along with some standard offerings, so I can understand the high ratings. For me, it's a solid dining choice for anyone in the area. However, experiencing problems in two different visits means that I just can't give it more than three stars.",

I never came across a pizza I wouldn't eat. That being said, there are quality levels and this one falls in the average category for me. However the price of the pizza here is great! I believe that pizzas have become a little overpriced everywhere, but not here! We got 1 large pizza, garlic knots, and 2 beers for $25. How can you beat this?!",

Delicious and I will be back !!!! *****\n\nOnly negative side is a faint smell of cleaning liquid and some flies lingering as the swinging door frequently opens and closes.

It's not all your standard bar food. They have spicy shrimp in thai peanut sauce over brown rice. It wasn't bad. They have wings, meatloaf, flatbreads...a nice variety.

    "text": "I have had a few pretty good experiences here and one really negative one that prompted our party to leave before eating. \n\nGenerally speaking, the food is good. It's the best Italian in town, in my opinion, but my mother would fight me on that one. They start you off with some complimentary bruschetta, which is nice. I recommend the Mixed Baby Greens salad to start, which is more like a Greek salad and is a generous portion for $5. I would also recommend the Porcini Stuffed Agnolotti. I have tried a few of their desserts - I liked the Chocolate Souffle but thought the Coppa Pistachio left something to be desired. The free limoncello shot at the end of the meal is a nice touch.\n\nThe problem here is the service. It seems that there is always a wait, even if you have a reservation. I don't usually mind waiting but they have very little standing room and no vestibule, so you end up standing by the door and get blasted with cold air every time someone opens it. I went recently with my family for their lunch buffet, which looked quite nice. We ended up waiting about 25 minutes, during which the hostess sat several smaller parties (which is fine), then started to seat a slightly larger party that had come in long after us. When we interjected to find out what was going on and why we had been passed over, the hostess said something along the lines of \"Oh I don't know, you all walked in at once.\" We had been there much longer, but apparently she hadn't been keeping a list (she told us so) even though she had been taking names. Isn't that what hostesses DO? Only upon us asking why this was happening and expressing our unhappiness with the service did she run off to check with a manger then report back that she needed to seat the larger party, without explanation. By this time the buffet was close to its end time and it seemed silly to pay only to receive the last bits and pieces, so we decided to leave and go down the street to Kooma where we were seated immediately and had a delicious brunch!\n\nThis restaurant is fine and a good choice if you are craving Italian food, but I generally prefer other places in West Chester. Also, be prepared for a wait and a potentially rude hostess!\n\nBut by the way, Richard works here now - he used to work at Gilmore's and is the best waiter in town!",

The PCH roll was somewhat dry, and while the tuna sashimi and Caterpillar roll were pretty decent I've still tasted better. Ironically, the most disappointing part of the meal was the tea that my parents and I ordered. It tasted like water; absolutely no flavor whatsoever.

And it was a Tuesday night.\n\nI ordered the Cheeseburger in Paradise.\" So for $12.99 you get a cheeseburger with lettuce, tomatoes, cheese, sliced (not the little circles) pickles, their secret sauce with a side of fries. The hamburger was pretty bland - I don't know how to describe it, but I felt like I was just eating a piece of meat with bread and some toppings. The fries weren't any better - they were about the thickness you'd get at a fast food joint, but they were too crunchy.\n\nWould I go there again? Probably not. It wasn't bad by any means, but for the time it took to cook the food, the underwhelming nature of the food, and the prices I will try something else next time I'm in Nashville.",

Most of the waitresses know us and are always nice and friendly, they greet us and even play with our kids. The last several times we've dined, the experience has been hit or miss, unfortunately. Some days the food is fantastic, other days, it's plain or oversalted (especially the salt and pepper shrimp) Our last visit, we came in to just eat sushi for dinner, and the crab topping they use for the sushi, such as the volcano roll, was old/spoiled. You could smell the old oil off the plate. We ordered about 6 rolls and most had some sort of crab on top. We mentioned it to the waitress and she looked like she knew about it because she interrupted us while we were telling her what was wrong with it, and said it was ok to leave all the rolls. Needless to say, we ended up leaving hungry, since we couldn't wait for more rolls to be remade (and we were afraid we were going to get the same bad crab) and ended up paying full price for just several appetizers. That kind of ruined Saki for me for the meantime. We may try the new location in Palm Harbor, once it opens up.",

I wanted to try this place's root beer float, after reading about it in one of the local alternative weeklies. Yes, it was in a strange place - an area I never go to, but not too difficult to find. The bright \"bar\" sign really helped! And the room was cool - large, dark and candlelit, huge bar, nice wooden decor. So, it could have been quite cozy. \n\nI was with two friends who wanted some food, so we grabbed an empty table. My root beer float was excellent, but they are difficult to mess up! (I suggest adding a shot of vanilla vodka to \"grow it up\" for you. Yum!) My friend's fries were great, and everyone seemed happy with the food - Shepherd's pie and a grilled cheese sandwich. The server was pretty efficient, always checking to see if we needed more drinks and food. We didn't have to wonder where he was, at all. \n\nWhy the 3 stars, you ask? Well, I was seated at a table and trying to talk to my friends, one of them across from me and one next to me. We had a very difficult time hearing each other, due to the deafening sound levels. The jukebox was okay, but just added to the high-decibel din. Too much! I was shouting at them and missing half of what they said. Most of our conversation consisted of \"what?\" I felt like when I left, it would be like when you left a concert - still shouting at each other with a raw voice. It might be good for dinner, due to the good food and atmosphere - I'm not sure - but Saturday night at 9:30-12:00 is too loud for me.",

Rubbery and fatty are words that come to mind.\n\nHowever, the chicken bacon ranch sandwich was excellent. The sauce and the cheese made it, and, of course, it had the bacon in it.\n\nIf you've never eaten here before, prepare to possibly be yelled at when entering the store. They're shouters here, like at Moe's, and usually belt out a big welcome (entire staff) every time the door opens. It's startling enough when you walk in, but then picture eating in the store while the staff is screaming every 3 minutes.",

    "text": "Let me be clear- I LOVE THAI FOOD!  Upon entering Siam Elephant for the first time, I really wanted the food to be good!  The service was exceptionally great, and accommodating .  (Note: I love good food of any kind, but I am also a bit \"picky\"). When I ordered the lunch special I politely said I did not want the egg roll and wonton , as they were fried.  The waitress quickly responded that they would substitute a fresh spring roll - first time I've ever had that happen!    \n\nFirst trip to any THAI restaurant , I order red curry to compare \"apples to apples\" . Again the waitress accommodated my request for extra vegetables but no bell pepper and baby corn.  ( I am a nice person , but often a waitress' worst nightmare )\n\nOn to the food - spring roll ( substitution) was nicely done with a sweet sauce with crushed peanuts and shredded carrot.  Lunch special soup was Tom Yum and was incredibly salty. I couldn't eat more than two bites. And personal preference for me, I like my mushrooms cooked- the ones in the soup were sliced and dropped in the hot broth so they were more raw than cooked.  This had nothing to do with the soup, just be aware for personal preference.  Red Curry came , medium spicy and was spot on for spiciness.  But the curry itself had NO flavor.  There was a nice assortment of vegetables, and the chicken had that weird texture - like it was boiled rather than saut\u00e9ed .  Took a bit of curry sauce alone without rice and it was simply bland .   And for all the times I complained about \" too strong\" Thai ice tea , this was again, bland .  I felt I wasted all those calories on a drink with no flavor !  On a positive note, I Had the brown rice instead of white rice and THIS IS THE FIRST THAI RESTAURANT THAT DOESNT CHARGE MORE FOR BROWN RICE!  \n\nThe food was disappointing overall,but the service was so good.  Overall rating was 3 stars , 1 for food and 2 for service  ( and for the brown rice upgrade at no charge) !",

I only had to wait 5 to 10 minutes to receive my bowl, which I think is reasonable. \n\nI ordered the Backyard Bowl (which only comes in the large size for some reason... why?). This acai bowl includes a base made of acai, banana, strawberries, and hemp milk. The bowl is topped with sliced banana, chopped strawberries, blueberries, goji berries, bee pollen and granola, plus a honey drizzle if you want. It's already sweet enough so the honey isn't necessary. I added peanut butter to mine for a protein kick and more flavor. I enjoyed the bowl itself, although it takes some work to get down to the actual acai base in the to-go cup. I would have liked a few more berries too. The granola itself is kind of meh... not bad but not great. For the price ($13 to $14 after tax and tip) I think the bowl should have been a little better. Again, don't get me wrong, it was good overall. If you're hungry and can put away a decent amount of food, you should be able to finish the large. Next time I would omit the goji berries because I'm not a huge fan of the flavor but wanted to give them another shot.\n\nEveryone working there was pleasant, but service wasn't spectacular. I don't care too much about that as long as I don't have to wait forever for my food to be ready. The place itself could have been a little cleaner... it wasn't super messy but there were strawberry butts scattered on the floor near the chopping station and the fruity smell in the air seemed a little stale. (That's just me being super picky and an OCD clean-freak... it's probably totally acceptable based on normal people standards).\n\nOverall, I wouldn't be opposed to coming here again in the future. I might try the pb&j quinoa bowl because that sounds amazing! Nothing beats the acai bowls in Kirkland, WA though.",

Therefore, if it is 100 degrees and you want to cool off with some ice cream, you will be enjoying your ice cream outside in that 100 degree heat.

I'll say that the burger meat itself was cooked to perfection (medium) with some great smokey flavor. However, the accompaniments were not so impressive.

Alas... it's getting 3 stars for balance. 2 stars seems harsh for a random act of poor service (plus, once the lead server / bartender recognized negligence he took care of the situation). \n\nWhy are there only two servers handling an entirely packed Friday lunch hour? If we cracked the books on human lunch behavior I'd guess that we'd see a spike in pizza eating on Fridays (lower stress) and Mondays (higher stress). I'd imagine that'd it be a good thing to always have extra staff on hand at any lunch spot downtown -- especially one that offers beer, sports, and pizza -- and especially one that has slowly built a pretty solid foundation for itself in just under a year. \n\nAlas... we waited. And waited. I could go on & on about how we waited. The saving grace? Sun King's Oktoberfest on draft touching my stomach. Once that happened... the business is guaranteed 3 stars. What's that Jon? Why? Well.. think about it. This business has the choice every day to serve swill or serve local suds. At the end of every day they consider the beer they have to put in an order for. They've maintained their commitment to local beer (probably because people are finally drinking it). With that, you're A-OK friend (or at least until SKB takes over every single bar in the city or they start serving their suds at a mortuary that's posing as a pub -- sure a cool thought but think about it...). \n\nHowever... please note that the longer you make me wait for pizza the higher the expectations are. Unlike when you make me wait for Sun King beer and then I have it, I know it will be great, I don't know for sure what this pizza will be like. \n\nYes I ate it. Yes I generally liked it -- but that's because I generally like cheese, bread, cooked cheese on cooked bread (really, I'd eat any version of it, anywhere, anytime). Nevertheless, it just wasn't all that riveting (and yes when I'm eating pizza I want to be riveted like I'm watching Kirstie Alley woo Patrick Dempsey in Can't Buy Me Love). \n\nOn a blustery day, a beer and cooked cheese and bread is perfect. I love walking in that alley. In fact, I close my eyes and think of the way this alley looked in 1907, and I especially close my eyes when I walk through the odd purgatory chamber of an office building hallway that you have to get through to get to the pub. When I open my eyes... I still find a place that serves $2 pints on Tuesdays, and for that you're A-OK.",

Those places are crap. \n\nI'm a lover of the south side pizza joints. Nick & Vito's and Roseangela's are the two best pizza places in Chicago, period. If I go dish Due's and Gino's are preferred. \n\nI digress, 312 Pizza is definitely a super noisy place and they really need to focus on the wait staff. Other folks have commented that they sat with empty beer/wine glasses for several minutes or so. This is a big no-no in the restaurant business. Hopefully they work out these kinks in the coming months.  The pours on Vino were also pretty weak. Look, I know you have \"measured\" amount that you've instructed your bartenders to abide by but c'mon, get a little bit  more generous on the pour. \n\nOtherwise, the food is good. I haven't ordered a dish pizza yet but the thin cracker crust reminds me of home. Good flavor with the sauce and the sausage crumble was italian chicago authentic. Bravo. \n\nI'm really hoping 312 can overcome some of these underlining issues as we need it to survive. I've only been down here for a few years and I'm already bored of the neapolitan places that are saturating this market (Desano's, Five points, etc). Those places are good but we need this as an alternative. \n\nLastly, enough with the Cubs stuff, why jinx the restaurant. Go Sox!",

Although there are tables and chairs outside on the sidewalk (nice touch), it's more of a sit-down place. There is a bar to chill out and have a beer while you wait, but since it was packed we didn't want to stand awkwardly next to a table and wait for a slice to come out. \nInterior is nice. I appreciate how clean and well-kept it looks.\nI think the fact that this place is busy means it must be doing something right. However, the wait staff we talked to was very awkward, not helpful, and made me want to run out of there. So, I did.",

The kitchen is that small they can't time the dishes to come out. Sure it's Italian, \"mangia mangia\", so you don't need to wait for others but the we usually do so food gets cold.\n\nThat said, the food was very good. I love to try the variety of lasagna in Santa Barbara. The largest portion, but not the best is from Arnoldi's Cafe, Trattoria Vittoria when it's done with lamb, is my favorite but a big round of applause for Tre Lune. The bechamel sauce was great and as mentioned, I'm a sucker for lamb ragu. This is the dish to beat.\n\nWhile I'm disappointed at the delivery (minus one star), the food was very good (4 star).

Not quite sure if primary function is to be a bar or restaurant. The menu is limited with appetizers, tacos, and burgers. We ordered chicken and pork tacos. The pork was excellent...sweet but with a kick.  The chicken was kind of dry but there was a variety of sauces to jazz them up.  What was impressive was the whiskeys and draft craft brews offered, I had a Green Flas West Coast IPA draft....in Indiana.

There are some really nice amenities,  especially the shopping. \n\nThe restaurants are somewhat disappointing.  Although many choices,  it kind of feels like different versions of the same choices.  Pricing is a premium,  but food is not. \n\nFinally,  I still don't think the resort understands what is necessary to be world-class.  It's not the property,  rooms,  or even the pricing.  It's the lack of that special sense of being taken care of.   \n\nAs a Marriott/SPG property, benchmark the Phoenician, Camelback  Inn or Desert Ridge in Scottsdale to see how it should be done.",

Live blues bands add to this fun, inviting atmosphere. Guaranteed, you'll see my friends here on many many weekends to come.\n\nAs for the menu, there are still kinks to work out. I think the biggest fault with Twisted Tail is their identity: it's not quite solid yet. The board has some interesting dishes to fit into  their \"bourbon and blues\" and open fire concept, though there are plenty that do not. \n\nThe Smokehouse Lightning cocktail was deeeelicious, for starters. The mac and cheese was intensely rich, though a bit bland, even with the addition of chewy crawfish meat. Lamb sliders were juicy little bites, though I tasted none of the sun-dried cranberry aioli listed on the menu. The \"primal chili\" had a great balance of meat and beans, topped with a bit of melted chocolate and (too much) sea salt. \n\nService was friendly, attentive and clearly nervous. Had a bit of a mix-up when we paid our check, leaving me a bit salty, but I won't fault them for it here. Shit happens, especially when you're a nervous new server.\n\nMaybe I'm being nitpicky, but all restaurants have to grow to really make it. I have high hopes for Twisted Tail, though, and am really glad they're in our 'hood. Give it a few months and I'm certain things will even out.",

Creative nonetheless, but it is far from authentic. There is a lot of grease and frying invoked.\n\nThe big downside to this establishment is the pricing. Some dishes were ridiculously small and simple for the price. Granted, this is a kind of tapas restaurant, but some of the dishes should be taken off the menu if they're going to charge these prices. There was a dish with a few cubes beets, and it was five dollars. They just tasted like beets, nothing more. Very disappointing. This was only one of the many overly simple dishes that are $5+\n\nThe service was also rather slow. It took 10 minutes for each small plate to arrive. In addition to this, the music was extremely loud and distracting, and the lighting was much too dim.\n\nAnother downside to this place was the lack of vegetarian options. Everything either had pieces of pork belly, or was fried in duck fat and whatnot. \n\nUPSIDES:\n\nBut I will say that their vegetarian ramen was out of this world. It was kind of misleading though because there was no broth; it was more of a thick coconut curry with noodles. Extremely tasty nonetheless.\n\nThe Spicy Shrimp Gyoza (dumplings) was also incredible. They were very well seasoned and flavorful.\n\nAll in all, we spent around $120 for a party of three, and were still a bit hungry. But if you have the money, the food here is very good. We might be back for a special occasion.",

The seasoning was almost like an Old Bay type thing. \n\nMaybe it's just the time we went, and maybe I will give them another chance, but as for now, we will keep searching for that late-night-south-jersey-gem.",

I got the queen of hearts. She got the nine of diamonds. This is totally random and does not reflect the order of the orders. It could just as well have been numbers or Monopoly properties.\n\nWe both ordered the same thing: Custom Cobb Salad ($7.50) with turkey (from the Caf\u00e9 Salad section). Other protein choices were ham or tuna.\n\nThis came in a massive bowl with mixed greens, sliced hard-boiled eggs, tomatoes, avocado slices, black olives and bleu cheese crumbles with their homemade ranch dressing.\n\nThis was a tremendous salad with such fresh, abundant ingredients; and they all shone and worked perfectly together.\n\nThe dressing was on the side, you could use as much or as little as you desired.\n\nI needed another napkin, so I had to go back up to the now-forming line and interrupt JUST to get another napkin.\n\nWhen we were finished, I needed a to-go vessel for half of my salad. So again, I went to interrupt the order line to ask for a receptacle.\n\nYou have to bus your own table, including separating, utensils from bowls from trash from recyclables. That's a lot of work. I do that at home, and do not expect to have to do that in a restaurant.\n\nNot to mention that if you're separating utensils from a half-eaten bowl of food, that's a pretty icky task to have to perform in a restaurant.\n\nI would suggest their business model is just a tad flawed, especially considering there were only three people working, including managing the drive-through. And they were interrupted two times by me for a napkin and a to-go vessel, which they easily could have had out in help-yourself areas.\n\nI don't know about this place. The salad was stupendous. Maybe drive-through is my answer.",

The flavor was what is expected of a burger, and the meat was tender. \n\nThe fries, however, were similar to re-warmed McDonald's fries. I definitely was not a fan of those. \n\nThe hot sausage poboy was excellent. Not too greasy, fresh bread. We had no complaints there. \n\nI ordered the oyster salad for myself. I was not pleased. My biggest complaint is that I strongly believe that those were pre-breaded oysters that restaurant stores sell in packs. They simply did not taste fresh to me or salty like fresh oysters. \n\nI did not touch the gumbo. It was super thick like gravy. I cannot say whether that was actually worthwhile. \n\nFinally, the crab cakes were pretty good. I enjoyed them...they had a nice crab flavor and were cooked perfectly. We opted out of the remoulade. \n\nThe employees are really kind. The atmosphere is nice! It is a large and open space with warm decor. \n\nI want to give this place another try because there are so many other options to try. I will update my review if necessary.",

The food, although not great, is good and the portions are very generous. I quite liked the spiced ketchup. My companion loved the pan-fried potatoes. I'd recommend sharing a breakfast like the pizza pita. It wasn't really a pita, more like a thin crust pizza that wasn't cooked much before it had toppings added to it. It was ok. You can tell the ingredients are inexpensive, which one should expect for the price and size.\n\nThe space is small but homey with lots of natural lighting. The fresh carnations on each table was a nice touch, as is the different and local artwork decorating the walls. The server was quietly friendly, polite and prompt, and kept our glasses filled. \n\nWay better than Humpty's, but not worth a 4 star rating, it's A-Ok, solid 3 stars. If I lived closer by, I'd be more likely to come back for a beer. Alley Kat on tap, $4/10 oz, $7/20 oz. Why isn't there a cozy little local place like this in every neighbourhood?",

They were busy so I understood the fact that nobody had greeted us right away. 10 minutes later someone said they would be right with us as they were walking past. Another 10 minutes went by and our drink order was finally taken and we put in an app order as well. Our app arrived in a decent amount of time, and it was delicious. We had the Pierogies, which my boyfriend had never tried and I grew up eating. Our server never stopped by until after the empty plate had been sitting there for awhile. When she finally came back by we ordered our entrees. I had the Basket of Crispy Little Fish while my boyfriend had the Farmer Rays Grilled Vegetable Muffuletta. The fish were very tender and it came with some very yummy sweet potato fries. The muffuletta came with some house chips that were great. \n  We were almost done with our meal and thought about ordering another beer, but our waitress was too busy to stop by the table. While I was in the bathroom my boyfriend stopped her to ask for some waters and to hear about the dessert menu. She told him she could tell us the dessert specials as they did not have a dessert menu, and would wait until I came back. About 20 minutes after I came back she finally stopped by. Water glasses empty and asked if we still wanted to know about the dessert. We told her we were still interested and chose the DIY smores. The smores were a fun little dessert. They bring you marshmallows, graham crackers, strawberries, hershey's chocolate and reese's peanut butter cups. Its also very messy. We had to grab napkins off a near by table because she had taken all of ours away.\n\nOverall, the food was great! The service however, was less than desirable. I'll give this place another shot and hope they redeem themselves next time.",

We also redeemed the check in offer for the free dessert but I couldn't tell you much about it as the boyfriend ate it all to make up for his lack of entree. Poor guy.

    "text": "My husband and I trekked from Memphis to St. Louis at the beginning of April for the USWNT soccer game at Busch Stadium. We arrived in St. Louis with a few hours to spare before game time, so we headed over to a burger joint, Bailey's Range, for lunch (I had found it ahead of time via Yelp, naturally). This restaurant was only a few blocks from the stadium and was buzzing with patrons. After fasting for Good Friday, a nice juicy burger accompanied with some fried pickles, french fries, and an ice-cold Coke sounded just right. The space itself was very neat, with large downstairs and upstairs dining areas. There was also an ice cream station at the front of the restaurant, which we sadly did not partake in. \n\nThe service was a bit slow due to the mad rush of soccer fans that they clearly were not expecting, so we were efficient whenever our waitress came by and ordered everything that we needed at once. \n\nWe started with the fried pickles appetizer. The batter was very good and I was suprised to see that the dish included different types of pickles. We then each ordered our burgers (me - the basic burger, my husband - the American burger). Both burgers were cooked to our preference and the toppings were nice, but nothing to write home about. The standout dish was the french fries (note - the large french fry is HUGE, two people could easily split the smaller portion). The ketchup accompanying the fries was very interesting - was there ginger in there? Who knows, but it was good! I would definitely recommend this burger place to anyone traveling to St. Louis.",

    "text": "To my surprise, this place is excellent. Disappointed to see lot of negative reviews because folks are judging based on comparison to where they are from. You have understand that this place is in a working class section of O'Fallon, Illinois; you're not going to get the authentic experience. This is plain and simple a good TEX/MEX buffet...period. They have your standard fare of the Mexican stable classics, burritos, enchiladas, etc. I find that the taste here is very flavorful, and sharp. The buffet lay out is a bit annoying as they serve the food to you from behind the buffet stand. Not too thrilled with someone touching my taco shell with their hands (I'm a germ freak) as they scoop the meat on there, but oh well. The flavor is heavy on cumin, but I think it tastes good. The buffet is really cheap. The atmosphere is cozy. Not sure if they need a salad bar in there, it doesn't fit well. They should just have additional Mexican dishes instead. But do stop on by, cause you will be surprised.",

    "text": "Just had a classic Wawa chicken salad hoagie. I topped it with spinach, American cheese, sweet peppers, pickles and both spicy and honey mustard. Pepper was also added. \n\nWhat I unwrapped was essentially chicken flavored mayonnaise. The toppings and mayo-mustard sauce were delectable on the soft roll, but I was really hoping that I had gotten more chicken. There are three reasons that could be contributing to my dismay. They could occur either in isolation, or some combination of the three:\n\nReason One: \nThe bottom of the chicken salad container. This area of chicken salad contains mostly mayonnaise and smaller chicken particles. \n\nReason Two: \nLunch hour. I was order #198. The sandwich being called at the counter was in the #178 range. At this time, I feel that the fine luncheoneers at this particular Wawa could have felt the pressure of the lunchtime rush. \n\nReason Three:\n\nHoagiefest. I'm sure that everyone is familiar with our favorite three month sandwich discount. More recently, the rolls moved from 12 to 10 inches. Could it possibly be that this is solely a marketing campaign and not a celebration of the world's fourth greatest sandwich?\n\nWild Card:\nLocation. There is not another Wawa in this area for, what in my estimation would, be a 3 mile radius, partially a manifestation of the lunch hour component. \n\nTwo stars for Wawa is a bit harsh, so due to past experiences with the Wawa chain, they earn three stars.",

I had a small fried chicken salad while my husband had the wicked apple burger. He had a beer and I had a strawberry basil boozy lemonade. His burger was small and the presentation was unappetizing. He said there was very little apple compote, which would have made it better and when I tried it I thought the meat was bland. My salad was bleh and had tough chicken. I didn't like the fried pickles as much as others I have had. BUT the loaded fries were really good and we both liked our drinks.

If you're in it for the coffee, go somewhere else.\n\nI really wanted to like this place because the vibe is awesome and I love supporting local businesses, but their drip coffee is over-roasted and WAY too bitter. Hot, iced, it doesn't matter. It's all super bitter. I wanted to like it so bad that I had one of their baristas personally french press me a 16-oz cup of coffee hand-chosen based on my desired flavor profile. It took 10-15 minutes to make and cost me $6. It was terrible. So. Effing. Bitter.\n\nTo be clear, I'm specifically talking about their coffee in this review. Their lattes and cappuccinos look delicious, but I've never tried them. That's not really my jam. So if you're like me and just want a regular coffee, go somewhere else (Handlebar, SB Roasting Co.).",

    "text": "Oh, how I miss the city! Being able to walk from our hotel to Prohibition was pretty awesome, even if there were a few sketchy corners along the way. Once inside, we took in the serpentine bar and packed tables with some difficulty (it was quite dark) and luckily found seats right away; by the time we left, over an hour later, people were standing three deep all around the bar. \n\nWe started out sitting at one of the bar islands, directly across from three strangers; this might appeal to some extreme extroverts, but it was a little awkward for us. They paid us no attention and had a very loud conversation (trendy vocal-fry girls -- ugh) so we tried to return the favor, but they were hard to ignore, so when true bar seats opened up we scooted over and left them to their workplace gripes.\n\nThe drink menu is pretty wonderful; awesome draft / bottle selection, in addition to a handful of craft cocktails. We stuck to beer and were not disappointed; the bartender, once he saw what we liked, offered us a couple of samples and was able to continue making us happy through several more rounds. \n\nWe weren't dinner-hungry, but wanted to try the battered green beans since so many had raved about them. They were pretty disappointing; the beans were overcooked and stringy, and the batter stuck together in huge lumps -- it was more like a battered green bean sculpture. We ate about half and left the rest. Next we tried the fried pretzel, which was good, though not exactly pretzel-like, since it had been deep-fried instead of soda-boiled. The accompanying queso was delicious, but there was only one small ramekin, so we ate most of the pretzel plain.\n\nIt turned out there had been quite a party a few hours earlier, as the first friday of every month is a pig roast. It sounded intriguing, but our server didn't know any of the details -- where, how and for what amount of time it was cooked, for instance -- so we didn't try it.\n\nWe would definitely return for the beer, and to try one of their standbys like the burger or the brick chicken.",

This place is usually always solid on all aspects but last night I think we had arrived too late, at 9:00 and the kitchen had sort of given up. Bread was literally burned and tasted burned.  I had the Bucatini that had zero flavor in the tomato sauce. It was like they used only tomato paste, no salt and no actual tomatoes. The sauce didn't have any of that acidic bite that comes with good homemade tomato sauces. Flavorless.  However, the lasagna was FANTASTIC as always.  My wife ordered that and we both agree we think it's the best we've ever had.  We will continue to go back because Valentinos is a solid restaurant most of the time.",

Why do men love this place?? Maybe it's the industrial concrete or the weird chains on the wall? \n\nAnyway, the food really is good - I recommend the nachos, guac or lobster hushpuppies, just don't be shocked when you get your pricey check at the end of the night. The drinks are only reasonably priced if you go on 2-4-1 Wednesday - unless you follow the lead of the d-bag at our table last night and walk out on your check. \n\nIf you're going with a large group make sure you get there early since they don't take reservations or let you call ahead. They also charge a $15 cake fee if you bring a dessert on a special occasion, even though they have no desserts on the menu. \n\nIt's not a bad place - it's in a good location, has good food and a cool vibe, I just prefer something a little cheaper and more low key.\nIf you share my preference for a midtown happy hour, allow me to suggest Brewhouse or Corner Pub instead.",

I'm not sure if it's the cooking process (the waiter described that the shrimp were pan cooked in the BBQ sauce), but the shrimp had this really weird texture: they had no snap at all and almost a mushy texture. Normally, shrimp this large have almost a lobster texture. There was a good amount of shrimp in the dish and the bib they give you makes for a hilarious photo that I can''t post :-)\n\nWe also tried the fried oysters which tasted great with the lemony sauce that was put on it.\n\nI had the braised rabbit since I hate taking shells off shrimp. This was cooked well and the sauce w/ tasso ham worked well w/ the mashed potatoes.\n\nAfter having dinner at Mr. B's and trying to figure out what to do for lunch on our last day, we decided to hit it for lunch on our last day. Unfortunately, it's definitely not as good as dinner. The jambalaya was ok but didn't have enough sauce. The stuffed pork chop was overcooked and oversalted and the pear stuffing didn't quite go that well with it (somewhat bitter?).  So it would have been 4 stars overall, but the lunch wasn't that great for me.\n\nService was excellent however.",

    "text": "Honey's is a trendy spot in Northern Liberties that lives up to its reputation as a place for a wonderful breakfast.  The decor is very \"shabby chic\" and fits with its more \"hipster\" 20-something clientele. \n\nFirst of all, we went on a monday morning to dodge the crowd.  We heard from friends that the wait could get seriously prohibitive.\n\nI had a fresh-squeezed orange juice which was incredible.  Any fresh squeezed juice that I've had has been amazing, but the price was equally palatable.  The coffee is still on my \"to-try\" list, however I hear its very good.\n\nI had the Challah French Toast (~$7.25) which came as advertised. It was very basic for the price.  Real maple syrup made this dish one of the best french toast I've had in quite some time.  To add to that, the blueberry preserves on the table complemented the meal quite well.  However, I would have appreciated a potato latke or some other side as the meal was... basic.\n\nMy wife got an omelet of modest size but smaller than I'd like, which tasted very good.  Their redskin potato home-fry was rather poorly made.  It tasted too much like olive-oil and was seasoned with WAY too much rosemary.  A decent spread but I couldn't help but feel like I was paying a bit for the experience as the food left a little lacking.\n\nBottom Line:  A great spot for a nice breakfast, but not quite worth the price for the taste and portion.\n\nI hear their bargain breakfast is ($3.95) quite the deal, and worth the price.  I'll have to try that next time and hopefully give a better rating.",

The steak is good and the service is professional.  The downstairs bar here is large and comfortable so it might be a good place to drink if the upstairs bar at original Galatoire's is full.  Generally I would prefer dining in the original Galatorie's but if it was full I wouldn't mind eating here again.  You can also access Galatorie's 33 from the upstairs bar at Galatorie's.  The dress code here is more relaxed than the original so if you find yourself in a more business casual mood then this might be a better choice than the original Galatorie's.",

Honestly, I left just slightly disappointed. Everything was good but some dishes were just ok. The seafood gumbo was really nothing great. Lacked flavor and I don't think I had any seafood in it! We had an order of king crab legs which were great!\nEntrees were also hit or miss. The roasted chicken was good but a little dry and the skin was kind of soggy. The grilled swordfish was also very dry and extremely fishy tasting. I didn't get to taste the burger but I heard it was good. The grilled ribeye was cooked more medium when asked medium rare but it was a great tasting steak. Awesome flavor and that maitre d hotel butter is unbelievable! The star which we all agreed upon was the shrimp and grits which was my entree. The shrimp were cooked perfectly and the jalape\u00f1o cheese grits were insane! An awesome dish! \nOverall Luke was a great meal! Nothing really negative to say about it. A few dishes lacked in my opinion and others were really great.",

    "text": "The long and short of this place is that the food deserves four stars, but the service at most two.   Their soups and sandwiches are excellent, although most are at least as French or Californian as they are Viennese.  (I lived in Vienna for a couple of years and know what you find there.)  The Hungarian goulash is quite good, being authentically Viennese (as opposed to Hungarian) in style.  I recommend it for chili lovers as a nice variation on the theme that most will like. :-)\n\nI'm diabetic and avoid sweets, but the couple of bakery items that I've tried have been excellent.  My husband has actually raved about the pastries.\n\nUnfortunately, if you eat here instead of taking food out, the service is slow, forgetful, and apathetic at best.  I've had the wrong items brought, soup brought lukewarm presumably because it had been served up and then was left sitting to await the rest of the meal, and lengthy waits for the check.  This isn't some cultural difference between American expectations and Viennese norms; the Viennese wouldn't find this level of service any more acceptable than I did.\n\nMy recommendation?  If you want to buy stuff to take home, this is a good place.  If you want to eat here, better bring lots of patience and a good book or good company because you will need it.",

Seating is plentiful, however it does get crowded during lunch so be advised, after the lunch rush you might find others using the cafeteria to work while waiting on people at the hospital, in fact I even used it to catch up on some work while waiting. \n\nOverall the experience was better than I had expected from a hospital cafeteria, decent food, reasonable options, and a fair price makes this a decent option while visiting the hospital.",

But because of the 30% off deal (which I had no idea about), they wouldn't use the stupid coupon (which btw they should specify on the actual coupon). Wish we had known since we ordered A LOT of rolls between to the two of us just to hit the $50. =P The 30% is a good deal and the rolls were really good. I would claim that this is one of my favorite sushi places here in S Jersey now. BUT the reason why I'm giving it only 3 stars is the not-so-great customer service. Staff was definitely not warm and friendly and they originally gave us the discount but then took it back (who does that?). Based on other reviews, I guess the special on rolls is on Sundays and Mondays so I'll def go there again on one of those days. Their godzilla rolls were good (not part of the special though) as well as their volcano and spice girl rolls. Also, be careful to pull into the right parking lot because it's confusing and if you miss it, it's a pain to get back to the right place. Park in the back- it's not the usual strip mall and has an odd layout.",

However it was 7:30 on a Saturday night. We had drinks at Picasso while we waited. Looking at the menu I noticed this sushi was, in my opinion, quite overpriced for the atmosphere and location. I believe $19 for most rolls of interest. Yet, I did have a very enjoyable time! I enjoyed that it's a BYOB, our waitress was extremely pleasant and the food was decent!

    "text": "My daughter recommended we go here and after sitting there for a few minutes I figured out why.  There are 3 gyms in the area including a rock climbing gym.  Let's just say, she was busy and distracted.  But hey, at least she wasn't on her phone.\n\nOne of my biggest pet peeves is not being able to park.  There is a nice big parking lot across the street that is free for the first 75 minutes.\n\nYou must order at a counter, which isn't bad, I suppose, but the prices reflect someone to serve you. They let you pick out your own emoji table marker so they know where to bring the food.  I thought that was kind of fun, a new way to express yourself at a breakfast joint.\n\nI totally missed the build your own hash, not sure how, it is front and center. I think it is trying to choose something reading off a big sign as you approach the counter. I was only looking under the board entitled breakfast. Not good under pressure maybe???  \n\nI ordered a very simple breakfast called The Patrol Combo; 2 eggs, bacon, garlic roasted potatoes.  They only had one type of bread, sour dough, which I thought was strange.  It wasn't even 10 am on a Thursday.\nI read on another review they were out of bread, so common theme? \n\nAll in all, it was very standard.  One thing I noted is the bacon looked way too crispy, over cooked, but it really wasn't.  It was really good.  Another, is the attention to detail, like adding the chives for decoration on the eggs.  I thought that was a nice touch.\n\nMy daughter had the eggs Benedict which she finished before I really even saw it.  She said it was good.\n\nI would like to go back and try the build your own hash.  I think that is where the 5 stars lie. I would also recommend going on a weekday so you don't have to wait in a long line.",

    "text": "First I must say the food was excellent.  The gorganzola filet with wine sauce was truly outstanding.  My primary complaint was with the service.  I was staying the week at the hotel next door and had dinner at Carmine's 3 times.  I finally came to the conclusion that management has trained the waiters to rush the service in order to turn the tables as frequently as possible.   Each night I dined with work  associates and throughout the meals the waiters kept trying to take away plates too soon.  It became difficult to have a relaxing dinner and constantly felt rushed.   On the 3rd night we spoke to the owner and it was clear that he did not want to take our complaint seriously and issued a very insincere apology.   In the end, he paid for our meals .  All of us at the table would have preferred that he would have acted more humble and treat us with more respect.  We were not looking for a free meal.  It was a company expense anyway.  We can only hope that he might think about what we told him.   We were most sincere and not trying to be difficult.  In his mind we were wrong and he was right.    All of the waiters I saw looked and acted somewhat inexperienced.  I suspect that mature professional waiters would not get along with the owner very well.   He seemed like a hot head and is probably difficult to work for.",

We began our meal by sharing the Duck Poutine, which will be described below, and the Crispy Brussel Sprouts with our friends.  The brussel sprouts were phenomenal.  The combination of the heavy char on the brussel sprouts, the spicy cranberry glaze, peanuts, onion, and parmesan were delicious!\n\nFor dinner, my wife and I opted to share some of Hemingway's small plates.  We had the Duck Poutine, the Risotto, and the Kale Salad.  Interestingly, the star of our selections was the kale salad.  It offered a very fresh and clean complement to the more savory risotto and poutine selections.  The risotto was composed of butternut squash, apple, walnuts, and goat cheese, which was tasty, but just satisfactory.  The Duck Poutine was also tasty, but it needed more cheese curds and more duck.\n\nAll in all, we were satisfied with Hemingway's and we believe it to be a restaurant worth trying, but it is not a star of the Nashville dining scene.",

It really was a good value for the price I must say, but honestly it sounded a lot cooler than it actually was. Just imagine adding overly sweet syrup to your eggs. Yuck ! On my pancakes and breakfast meat sure ! Eggs that's a no go. So I had to do some rearranging and there really wasn't much space on the tiny table we were seated to do that. \n\nOverall it was okay but I wouldn't drive out of my way to come back.",

What I don't love is sometimes that means having beers that are really not to my taste, while other times I find gems. I found the bartenders and waitresses, while they know their beers, don't know many other drinks. And have a hard time suggesting something to your specific tastes, if it isn't on special. However the sheer amount of beers and the impressive 24 rotational beers make this a location that I can keep coming back to. Especially with groups of people, the problem with that however is table space, this is a place best shared with large groups and there isn't enough space for everyone, especially with small groups of 2 or 3 taking up full booths or eight person tables. This normally is only a problem on weekends however. My favorite nights to go are Mondays (there is local comedy) and Tuesdays when there aren't as many people but it's still the same great place.\n\nThe food is mediocre, but no one is coming here for the food. I've had a different things each time I've gone (six or seven times) and everything from the appies to the desert has always left me sort of meh and wishing I had just bought another beer instead of buying food.\n\nIt's a great place to go with a big group of friends (as long as you are willing to wait for a table on weekends, or go during the week) and try out new beers or craft beers that you won't find on draft anywhere else in the city.",

Luckily, a hostess/manager was floating around the restaurant asking how things were and we told her about our missing drinks. She was able to get our drinks quickly; although, since our waitress forgot, we didn't end up getting them unitl after our meal was served. I also noticed that other tables had received bread and butter, which we never got. It also took awhile for our dinner plates to be cleared and for our check to come. Also, there was a very drunk group at the bar, wandering around and bumping into the servers and making loud remarks. I would expect a group like this on Bourbon Street and not at a nicer restaurant, yet nothing was done and they kept on serving them drinks. Overall, the service was slow and not very attentive.\n\nI would dine here again in hopes that the poor service was a fluke. The raw oysters were probably the freshest I had on my visit to NOLA.

These restaurants would get 1 or 2 stars west of the state of Louisiana. However, since so many people in Tampa Bay have never actually had great Mexican or Tex-Mex food, they think this is the best Mexican food they've ever had. And that's because it is, because they haven't eaten Tex-Mex in San Antonio, TX, for example. Where they make tortillas that melt in your mouth\n\nBut back to Red Mesa. I think I have found an accurate way to describe Red Mesa:\n\nThe food that you get here tastes no better than the (Tex-Mex) food you would get at a Mex chain like Chili's, but Red Mesa fancies up the menu descriptions and jacks up the prices and adds a little hip restaurant decor in order to make you think the food is better than it really is. \n\nIt's just bland, mediocre Tex-Mex style food that can be had at Chili's for much less money.\n\nAdvice: If you are going to eat here, stay away from the appetizers and side dishes and the tacos which are outrageously priced. (In Texas they would laugh you off the street if you told someone you paid 5 dollars for a taco, like Red Mesa charges.) Try to order a \"combination\" platter that has 1, 2 or 3 items for one price. Stay away from the guacamole, which is NOT WORTH 7 dollars. Just try to fill yourself up with the chips and get a combo dish. Desserts are also mediocre.",

    "text": "I've always liked this On The Border... it's like Chi Chi's on Don Pablo's, with one major difference - the food is really delicious!  It's like every other Mexican chain restaurant in terms of menu choices, decor, and presentation, but something about the way everything tastes just makes them a cut above the rest.  \n\nWe've also always had really great service every time, so kudos to whoever does the hiring in there.\n\nNow on to the reason they're only getting 3 stars... up until recently, they gave you the option to build your own burrito.  Every table was equipped with a pad of paper with all types of burrito choices on it for you to fill out however you want, and you would then hand it to your waiter and be presented with your perfect burrito shortly thereafter, no ifs ands or buts.  In my opinion, probably the best thing they had going for them was this build your own burrito note pad.  Boyfriend and I went there Monday night and were devastated to learn that in addition to the menu changes mentioned by the previous yelper, the build your own burrito option is now no more.  \n\nBad move, OTB.  Bad move.\n\nI got enchiladas instead, and they were delicious.  But something about filling out check boxes and having full control over what's being put on my plate will be very sorely missed.",

    "text": "One of our favorite things when trying out a new place is to sit at the bar (when we don't have our kids), order a nice cocktail and pick a couple of appetizers to nibble on.\n\nWe were in town for a few days and stopped into Charro Steak to check it out.  We sat at the bar.  I ordered an \"El Maestro\" off their cocktail menu.  The bartender said they ran out of peppers (jalapenos?) and to choose something else.  I did.  The other drink was okay but I really wanted that spicy marg.  My wife liked her drink (with the upside-down Pacifico).\n\nOn their lunch menu, they have \"Mixtas!\" - which seemed exactly what we wanted:  tapas-style plates we could share.  I ordered three (for $7) and added steak.  The bartender wanted to charge a split-plate fee.  I have always been confused by this concept.  If a couple are sharing food and want to eat off the same plate, that should be okay.\n\nSo I ordered more mixtas so she put the order in on two plates.  All together we had the Chilaquilas, Esquites con Crema, Chile Verde Mac & Cheese and Spinach & Nopalitos en Crema.\n\nThe steak was good....but the rest of the food sounded way better on paper than it tasted.\n\nSo far my first experience here was \"meh\" but I would definitely like to come back and have a real dinner based on the other reviews and photos I have seen.\n\nOh one more thing:  the Charro Steak website has some issues (all browsers).  The upper menu has white text over a white background, so finding the menu (which also appears outdated) was a real treat :P",

No wait...don't go!  It'll be great!\n\nOk well for those of you who stayed...here's my back story.  We were in the GSR for a Pentatonix concert.  We had gotten there early to camp out a spot to get a better seat because the general admission at the GSR is really bad.  So this meant that during our dinner hour we were going to be stuck in line.  Luckily a very nice couple held our spot while we stopped into Johnny Rockets.\n\nWe asked to sit at the bar to make it quicker.  We ordered up two chili dogs for my daughter, a classic burger for my wife and I ordered up the Houston. I upgraded to sweet potato fries for a buck extra.  The burgers coming out looked really good, mine wasn't as good looking and was just fine tasting.  Nothing to write home about or get excited about, just a standard fare sort of burger.\n\nMy daughter however loved the chili dogs and ate them all up and her fries.  She enjoyed the paper hat that came with the kids meal menu.   Our waitress Daniel was really busy but also really helpful and friendly.\n\nSo if you are staying at the hotel for either a convention or just gambling, this place is a good place to eat for a reasonable price.  The prices are right in line with any other sit down burger joint, maybe even a little lower.\n\nParking isn't really that close because it's inside the mall downstairs at the GSR, but it is 1000000 times better than it's old location on the casino floor getting covered in smoke all day long.  \n\nWondering how busy they will be when summer comes and \"The Beach\" is open.  We will see.",

After finally going in to check it out, it is, as the three-stars indicate, A-OK. Not great, but not a bad deal especially if you're looking for a good-sized slice of pizza for a cheap price. My only hangup with them is that their single slices are kept in a glass case and are ran through an oven for a quick warm-up when you order. It makes the pizza taste far less better than it would if it were fresh, which seems to be what you get if you order an entire pizza. So if you're going to go to No Anchovies, make it with a group of friends and order an entire pie. The Hawaiian is dynamite.",

It was almost end of lunch hours when we visited...but I did not expect some items were already \"out\" from the menu. Waitress said that those will be ready and served for dinner time. That was a real disappointment for me as I saw special items. Anyway, I have visited one in Doylestown, and maybe I should not compare...but just like Eugene mentioned, I could not get a good feeling and taste. Lunch special came with 5 pieces and a roll. Tuna, Salmon, Ebi, Hirame, White Fish (Tilapia for sure) and California roll. California roll was average to better...and Tuna (Akami) was aged nicely, I thought. But the rest...hmmm, I could not agree. Ebi was definitely pre-cooked and frozen and lost its texture. Salon and Hirame were below average. the worst was white fish with a little of tobiko topping...not sure why?\nI can say price/amount was average as well. \nI am thinking...with a little disappointment, should I come back for dinner time?\nI would rather drive a little more and go to one in Doylestown.",

I ended avoiding the lettuce because I couldn't stop laughing at how ridiculous it was. There is only one place in town that has gotten the lettuce-bun right and that is Yard House. For my side order, I got chili vs. fries. GROSS!!!! It must've been scraped off the bottom of the pot because it was cold, mush, and not tasty.

Did not like the chili at all - the \"burnt ends\" were just cubes of brisket and the pieces were too big to manage in a chili.  The caesar salad was good but the lettuce was a little on the limp side.\n\nBoss had the ribs; glad I didn't order them because I could tell by watching him eat them that I would not have liked them.  I like tender, juicy meat that falls off the bone into my mouth and just melts.  These looked a little dry for my taste and he struggled to eat them with a knife and fork.\n\nWe agreed that the best part of the meal was the little piece of cinnamon bread pudding that came on the side of their lunch specials.  \n\nService was spot on, but we will probably stick to Sugar Fire or Pappy's for BBQ.",

I don't care for the bones, and I don't like the boneless ones either bc they just remind me of chicken nuggets. I actually liked these chicken wings, and I loved the Honey BBQ sauce. He liked them too. There was quite a bit of sauce and I was all for that, and the wings were pretty meaty. I usually associate wings with not having much meat on them but these were pretty good.\nI would definitely have them for takeout.

    "text": "We were delighted to walk in and get seated right away. They have a very interesting cocktail menu and we enjoyed our drinks, which came very quickly. I had the Ice Queen, a little on the tart side but still refreshing in that NOLA humidity. We then waited over an hour for our food. I think they must have had some kitchen issues because we weren't the only table. We looked around an no one had food. Then all of a sudden several tables worth of food came out all at once. Alas, not ours. When it finally did come it was delicious. We split the meat pie and I wish we would have each gotten our own. The meat inside was seasoned nicely without too much heat. I had the grilled gulf fish with asparagus and potatoes. I'm not sure if this was a pro or a con because I do love butter but my whole plate was swimming in it. Needless to say I inhaled it. My husband had the BBQ Shrimp and grits and although not a fan of grits he enjoyed his as well. The grits to me had a weird flavor bit I'm a fan of bacon and butter in mine (see a trend in my eating habits?) so it may have been my own personal preferences getting in the way. If you are down in the area and want something not on the tourist beat it is worth a stop by at least for some drinks and apps!",

    "text": "Stopped by here for a drink and some foods. I'll start by saying it is a strange ambiance because it is supposed to be an old speakeasy feel but there is a large screen TV in the front promoting their upstairs music venue. Don't get me wrong, I love the idea of bringing music into the mix (one of my fav. local bands actually played there the night after), but it just kind of takes away from the feel they were going for. \n\nIt was nice to see the bar pretty full on a Friday night, definitely not a common occurrence at the former, Liberties.\n\nMoving on. Their menu offers a large variety of food from sandwiches to \"pies\" and salads. Next time I have my eye on the pork belly banh mi sliders. I ordered the Reuban and it was very well executed and was the perfect amount of food for $10. The fiance ordered the smoked turkey sandwich and was also satisfied with his selection. The sandwiches come with a pickle and these house made parmesan chips that are off the chain. (It's $1 to sub in fries). We also ordered fried pickles, they were kind of bland, and doughy (I think the frier wasn't hot enough or they weren't swimming in there long enough). The sauce they came with was also kind of weird and too sweet. \n\nThe craft beer selection is decent but there are no prices listed on the board--and for a good reason. They are entirely too expensive, even for nolibs. \n\nI will probably stop back in another time to try out a cocktail and a few other menu items. Maybe I'll even catch a show. B&B has a lot of potential but I'm not hooked yet.",

    "text": "We frequent 312 after kickball league nights, and it is often packed, so be warned, there may be a wait (it's not a huge place). Also, if there are Chicago sports on TV, there WILL be a wait. They did just add an outside patio as well, so more seating will help. There is street parking all around, just be aware that it may be a couple blocks walk when there is a Sound's game going on, but still nothing too far.\n\nIf you come here for pizza, expect to wait at least 45 minutes for your food. It will be worth it. This isn't Giordano's or Lou Malnati's but it is the best deep dish Nashville has to offer. Don't forget about their thin crust either, it's legit. Their cheese sticks are fantastic. Basically, if it has cheese on it or in it, you won't be disappointed here.\n\nDon't forget to ask for the specials. They just started doing deep dish by the slice ($6 for pepperoni) and it's in front of you in less than 10 minutes. Worth it.\n\nAlso, as a ranch fanatic (none of that nasty Hidden Valley, homemade only) I have to say that 312's is THE BEST. It is different than usual, a bit more garlicky, but so amazing. So get a side salad for that sandwich and put some ranch on it. Or dip your cheese sticks or pizza in it. Just make sure you try it.",

Well our second visit didn't go any better.  The food was very bland both times, and really just not good.  Penca does not serve Mexican food.   There are too many other \"Mexican\" joints downtown to go to, before Penca.  I suggest Poca Cosa (which is not Sonoran Mexican food), El Charro, or even Street Taco and beer instead.  I will say this.  The vibe of the restaurant is great, and the staff is awesome!  They also make a great sangria.  It would be a great place to stop and have drinks, or meet up with friends before heading somewhere else downtown.  I give the food a 2 star, the vibe and service a 4.",

Bday parties , families, not a romantic place. a place  you don't want to hang out in for more than an hour or you will leave smelling like fried oil.\n\nwish the time was the only consideration in the 3 star rating. the service was slow and inattentive since all three -- the burgers and the fires came out lukewarm to almost cold. we ordered medium cooked burgers and the bison was well done, hard and lacked any of the described toppings except for a few mushrooms. so it was texture and lack of flavor. the aged burger was good. it was not quite juicy since it was not served warm but it tasted  good enough for a lukewarm burger, I guess. my husband liked it a lot more than me. the fries are fine and the best part were the pickles. \n\nthe beer list is packed with local beer options for half and full pours which is kind of fun since one could try a few different beers at very affordable prices. the wine is considerably pricier and the list very limited, almost discouraging. \nI tried the red blend and it was underwhelming to say the least -- too thin and too sweet.\n\nwe noticed other tables were served food before us even though we were seated a good 15-20 minutes before them. \n\nafter speaking with management we ended up paying only for the beer. the management staff was very understanding and willing to help. The stars go for the food concept/ potential and the way management responded.",

The menu choices were appealing and we put in an order for two burgers, fries, a fish sandwich and trail salad.  Then we waited, and waited and waited some more.  Fifty minutes later our food still did not arrive with no real explanation (or apology) from our server.  The manager was pleasant and after she was alerted our food did arrive. The burgers were tasty as were the Belgian fries. The trail mix salad had too many dried cranberries for my liking making it much too sweet.  I think with a different server the experience may have been more positive, but with so many great restaurants in Nashville I won't be going back to find out.",

I received a text from my wine sipping friend and  her bff heading back from Sonoita asking me to meet them at Penca downtown around 7. True to a a ladies sense of timing they didn't arrive until 830. Which sounds bad, but it couldn't have worked out better. I called Penca to try to get a table on hold...they were booked solid...it was there last day of business for a month(could someone convince my place of business to do the same!) so that on top of second Saturday downtown happening....it was loony. I arrived before 7 to get my name on the \"please God find me a table\" list. The Hostess was a doll and highly entertaining and found me a seat at the bar where I could drink beer and pass time. I ended up getting a quesadilla while waiting. It was very very good. Served with beans and fresh veggies between the tortillas...i did enjoy it. My favorite Hostess in the world found a table for us eventually. Table was designed for 2 comfortably, but beggars cant be blah blah blah. My companions ordered drinks, I had another beer. I ordered the tacos, pappas and carnitas...both were very good along with the rice and black beans. The building was not air conditioned well and the humidity made everyone a bit uncomfortable I think. The service was average, they were busy. I would like to go back under better circumstances,",

The atmosphere and service were fantastic.  The person who took my order was friendly and helpful.  The restaurant is spacious and clean.  She suggested the rooster sauce for my fries and I had no complaints about the fries or sauce.  Unfortunately, my burger experience was not so great.  Keep in mind the fact that I was hung over and hadn't eaten since the previous night, so a Big Mac would have been delicious to me.  I ordered the $12 ground lamb burger and was highly anticipating it's lamby goodness.  When the burger arrived, it came with a homemade pickle (good) and homemade ketchup (fantastic).  Now, when I order a burger at an upscale (ish) burger restaurant, I don't expect the burger to be large.   However, I do expect an appropriate bun size that doesn't totally overpower the rest of the sandwich.  In this case, the homemade bun was dry and far too thick for the not-so-well-endowed burger patty.  I ended up taking the top half of the bun and eating the burger like that and it was better.\n\nAll that said, the sides, shakes and atmosphere were enough to make me lean positive in spite of the burger, but barely.  I would be debating 4 or 5 stars if the burger was fantastic.  Unfortunately it wasn't, and considering burgers are the main draw here, the best rating I can give is an unenthusiastic 3 stars.",

My french toast was crunchy not nice and fluffy like I like. The french toast was lacking brown sugar, cinnamon, and nutmeg. It came with fruit which was nice.  The turkey bacon wasn't crispy enough.  Overall C++. Prob won't be back.",

The service was mediocre to non existent. We had to ask for bread which finally came quite late after asking a couple of times. We had to ask for drink refills. We were left alone for the most part and had to ask when needed something. I expect better service at this calibur of resturant  The shrimp were not of good flavor as we've has before here or at St. Elmos.  One strip steak was fairly good but one that was suppose to be medium rare was medium to medium well. The steak salad was very good and cooked to order. The spinach salad was good as well. Next time, we will go to another resturant that has higher quality of service and food.",

    "text": "I certainly had higher expectations for this place. Maybe it's due to the fact that I'm not a burger kind of gal, but impress me, it did not. A group of ten recently had lunch here for my niece's birthday, and I think about 25% of our party enjoyed their meal, while the other 75% shared my way of thinking. \n\nWe were seated right away, which is a definite plus for having such a large group. However, they sat us at this super long table in the center of the space where it was impossible to hold a conversation with anyone other than the person directly across from you or next to you. Whatever, I had a headache and didn't feel like being too social anyway. The waitress came around to take our drink order, and most people at the table ordered a shake. I'm on a current health kick, so I had ice tea instead. When the shakes arrived, I didn't feel like I was missing out on anything though. The small size was just that... super tiny... like, two dixie cups worth in a glass tiny. Definitely not worth the $3.50 price tag. \n\nOn to the food. Everything here is served a la carte. Most of the specialty burgers come at a set price, but if you order the basic and add anything to it, we found that you could be up another $4 or more just by switching your bun and adding a slice of cheese and bacon. You want a side of fries or onion rings? That'll be a few more dollars. Oh, you expect silverware? How much is it worth to you? (Ok, they don't really charge for silverware, but you get where I'm going with this... I hate being nickeled and dimed for every little thing!) Everyone in our group ordered something different, and though I don't recall what each person got, I only heard the verdict from everyone as we were walking out (note the 25% / 75% above). I had the veggie burger and quinoa side salad. The veggie burger was decent. It was a sweet potato patty topped with pecan butter and spinach. The quinoa salad was not my favorite and I was actually proud of myself for finishing at least half of it. It's served cold and mixed with dried cherries, onions, and balsamic vinaigrette. The onions were overbearing though... that's the only flavor that came through.\n\nAt least the birthday girl enjoyed her shake, but as for me, I don't expect that Bailey's will get another nickel or dime from my wallet anytime in the near future.",

    "text": "This is one of those places that I really want to love. I've lived down the block for a few weeks now, but visited Crazy Sushi even when I was living up in UC.\n\nTo start off, the food is good. The rolls are priced fairly, and the veggie gyoza compares to the best of the same that I've had in Cali (full disclosure: I think Cali has the best Japanese food in the country). The plates are beautifully decorated, and I think the decor inside the place, bar the color changing effects, are absolutely beautiful (I'm a fan of contemporary design). In particular, the sweet potato roll and the cucumber+avocado roll are my favorites, although I'm looking forward to trying the mango one soon too.\n\nIn any case, I really want to like the place, but the constant finding of hairs (not ours) in the food during our two visits and the subsequent 'not-caring' of the wait staff has been somewhat disappointing. Further, the lack of attention to detail - not bringing over new soy sauce containers when the other one is empty, not refilling water, etc. is disappointing as well, and in all, costs Crazy Sushi 2 stars.\n\nWith that being said, the food is still good, but if they just wore hair nets or whatnot and kept things more hygienic, and improved service a tad bit, that would definitely go a long way!",

    "text": "\"Burger Up\" Burgers...are?? Ok.\n     Maybe the over extended rants and hype about the burgers at \"Burger Up\" escalated my expectations. The burger I had was \"ok\" good. It wasn't \"soooooo gooood\" that I could say its in the top 3 of BNA. I gotta stick by my standards. Burger up has some things I think rock but they don't really transpire over into everyday awesome food for a good price. \n   \nThe location alone exudes a \"Wannabe Snooty\" type of a burger place. I've always believed, that burgers are better made.. \"un-gourmeted\". You grill some exotic meats, so what, its still the meat that makes them taste great. (Say that in a Christopher Walken Tone) \n   \n   I couldn't tell if the fries were really done in truffle oil.The parmesan cheese flakes worked. I really think its a gimmick for the \"Richy Riches \"in the area to make themselves feel better about eating a burger. The selection of locally raised beef was a plus. The homemade ketchup was refreshing. The atmosphere is respective and I will say the service was excellent. The menu offers a comfortable selection of entrees to both carnivores and herbivores. The highlight here is fancy schmancy burgers made from beef.\n\n  My Synopsis: Its for \"Sheeple\" who wanna buy a burger and not feel bad about eating one cause its \"Organic or something??\"",

I suggested this to my family because of the reviews here on Yelp and my brother has been here before to add to the positive comments but for me, my first impressions of it (service-wise) weren't too good. \n\nThe food, on the other hand, was good and I would probably give it another go because of  it.

    "text": "Eaten here a few times and came strictly for drinks yesterday. Bailey's and all their restaurants are great and so is the Range. 3.5 stars would be a truthful number. Mainly, I round down because of their service. My reasoning for the almighty stars would be as follows: \n\n4 - amazing food. quality ingredients with chefs who know how to experiment with flavors that go together better than you and your girlfriend (boyfriend). I have not heard anyone saying they do not like their burgers. They are small (errrr. Gourmet) in portion but big in flavor. Sauces are hit and miss, french fries are good to great, and everything I've eaten or tried off another plate was a big hit, except for the patty melt which is a bust. My stove does better than theirs for this regard. \n\n3.5 - price point again is the Achilles heel for all Bailey's places to me. I am from Chicago. When I want to pay Chicago prices I usually end up going to all the best places in Chicago. St. Louis has been rated one of the most cost effective cities to live in recently - NOT because of the Range, Chocolate Bar, Rooster, etc. \n\n3 - The service is average, at best. The staff is friendly? (not rude), slow, and I find it hard to remember a time when they have gone out of their way. It is as if they are not working for tips. \n\nSure, the Bailey's restaurants are sleek, sexy, cool, and important to the city evolving...I love that. But please hire some people who are also sleek, sexy, cool, and important to the city evolving.",

We are not thirty something hipsters who learned about the place from their thirty something hipster friends. And were certainly weren't one of the small crowd sitting at the bar being entertained by the staff. We were scorned when we asked about reserving a table, yet they thought they could work us in, and once we showed up for dinner we had a choice of 4 empty tables. The restaurant was never more than half full the two hours were were there. Once we were seated we were practically ignored and usually had to go to the bar or grab someone as they went by to get service. \n\nOK, the food. We ordered a salad and a pickled plate, both were great. Since it was the day before my wife's birthday and our last night visiting New Orleans, we went for the Wagyu beef tenderloin. I would have never imagined paying $67 for a 5 oz. piece of meat, but we did and shared it. We're from Iowa so we've had good beef. We never knew something this good existed. It was cooked perfectly and came with a choice of dipping sauces, we chose the horseradish sauce. It was truly unbelievable. Our dessert was good but not memorable. \n\nFor an establishment where you can walk out the door with a $135 bill, the service should be good if not excellent. The waitress seemed remorseful and embarrassed when we shared our experience. Maybe this will spur her to strive for mediocrity which would be an improvement. We're going to look for other restaurants that serve Wagyu.",

The drinks were delivered by someone other than our server. We didn't place our dinner order until I was almost done with my glass of wine. Food came out promptly and was delivered by someone other than our server. This was at 6:30 on a Tuesday and not during Mardi Gras or anything like that. \n\nMy husband and I both had filet mignon with spinach and potatoes. The spinach was surprisingly delicious. Potatoes could've used a little something. Steaks were cooked perfectly. You could cut it with a butter knife. So yum. \n\nGood experience overall, but I'm glad I wasn't super hungry when we got there!",

    "text": "This place has great atmosphere but the menu is dumb. It's just a few phoofy pretzel sandwiches that don't really go along with drinking at a bar. It's like they have an identity crisis. It's not really a German style restaurant but they're charging high prices for a limited German style menu. They just need to get some damn wings, burgers, nachos and regular bar food in there. And would it kill them to get at least one Belgian beer in there? Every bar in Nashville has nothing frickin' IPAs. Lame. Also they're not open on Sundays so you can't go there to watch the game. So why the tv screens then, so we can watch dancing with the stars? It's just doesn't make sense. Are you an actual village pub or just a fake North Korean store front?",

    "text": "After a truly phenomenal meal at Restaurant August, I thought we should splurge on another John Besh experience. I made reservations for a Sunday night with no problem at all.\n\nWell, the food was delicious. I had gulf fish meuniere and boyfriend had shrimp & crab etouffee. The fish was really lightly fried with a wonderful meuniere sauce that was just perfect - not too goopy like it can be at cheaper places. The etouffee was awesome, too. It came over pasta, which is unusual, but it totally worked. We also had a St. Charles Streetcar and a Sazerac to drink. No complaints, but also no rave reviews on those.\n\nNow for the reason I gave 3*. I've had more attentive service at Applebee's. And come on, this is a John Besh place we're talking about. Our waiter, Terrione (I think?) barely said 10 words to us. He actually just motioned at the water once instead of asking if we wanted more.\n\nI assume we were halfway ignored because we were younger than the other patrons, but if I'm giving you money, act like you care! If you're younger than 40, try sitting at the bar - they might be forced to give you more attention.",

My brother decided to get the breaded pork tenderloin sandwich, I decided to get the corn beef and cabbage, and we decide to split a small shepherds pie.  The shepherds pie was excellent; however, on our bill they charged us a $2 split fee without telling us about it and then our waiter seemed indifferent when we asked him about it.  The portions of the sandwich and corn beef were large but other than that unremarkable. It wasn't bad but nothing to write home about either.  The Shepherd's pie was definitely the highlight. \n\nAlso, they don't seem to be able to make a proper half and half.  I ordered one and they made it with Guinness and Bass - instead of Guinness and Harp.  Now that would be o.k. once since sometimes people make them that way and I didn't specify but the second time I said make it with Guinness and Harp and they still made it with Guinness and Bass.\n\nI like that the place is non smoking - that is a big plus given most of the bars close by allow smoking.  They also have a nice selection of whiskey at the bar.  I will definitely go back for the shepherd's pie and to enjoy some of their whiskeys - but this trip there were a couple minor things they could have done better.",

    "text": "We went to Luke during jazz fest, there was a group of six of us, and we were seated in the most awkward booth in the restaurant... staring at the front door right by the host's stand. We all started with cocktails, which were pretty fantastic. I'm a big fan of the French 75. The server disappeared for a long time before we could order... any questions we had about the menu we had to look up on someone's iphone since he was not available to answer questions about terms we were unfamiliar with. \n\nWe began the meal with salads... I had the yard egg salad, which was pretty fantastic! My favorite part of the meal, by far. The way the egg explodes onto the greens with the crunch of crispy pig's ear... just amazing. The person who brought our salads was not our server and was very confused about who had ordered which salad, there seems to be a pretty serious lack of communication at Luke.\n\nEveryone enjoyed a different entree, and after a considerable wait, which is somewhat understandable considering how busy they were, they finally arrived. My mom had the mussels, which was stuffed to the brim, good quantity, although the flavor was fairly bland. It also came with fries which were COLD. My mom did send them back and after a bit of a wait, got a fresh batch. I had the duck confit, which I think was one of the best entrees, although it did come with some kind of fatty pork product that I passed off to my boyfriend which he happily ate. My boyfriend had the crispy pork belly and clams pasta, which was just fairly bland overall. Everyone else was pretty underwhelmed with the experience.\n\nAt some point through the entree some of the people ordered another round of drinks... they were out of some of the beers on the menu, and the server never brought a glass of wine that was ordered, however he didn't charge us for it either so it wasn't  that big of a deal.\n\nFor dessert, my boyfriend had the bread pudding that was fairly dry and did not come with enough sauce or ice cream to make up for the dryness. \n\nOverall, we were generally disappointed. I love John Besh and have really enjoyed my experiences at Restaurant August. I think that a lot of the problems at Luke are a result of understaffing and poor management.",

The steak was very lean, I doubt that it was prime and had no flavor of dry aging.  Just not a quality piece of meat and not well prepared.  Deep fried potato discs were not crisp and undercooked.

The quiches (I got both Lorraine and Florentine) looked and tasted great. My side of bacon was nicely cooked, toeing the line between chewy and crispy. All good pros. \n\nNow for the cons: Their machine was down, so I was limited to regular coffee instead of espresso or latte, which isn't the worst thing ever. However, the side of fruit salad I bought had seen better days. The honeydew and watermelon were starting to break down and looking translucent at the edges, and had subsequently lost the majority of its flavor. I ate a few pieces and threw the rest away. I was a little bummed, but not totally surprised because it's a chain. \n\nWas it great? Not really. Was it serviceable, considering the amount I paid? Sure. Will I go back? Probably, but only out of sheer convenience. I live down the street. So there's that.",

Same with the service, sometimes its great, sometimes its terrible. The Steak Nachos when I had them one time they blew my mind, lots of thick cut green peppers and onions and creamy queso, the next time I went back there and had the same thing and it wasnt even half as good, will go back but if its mediocre again ill probably have to find a new Mexican place.

They are cheaper than Win-Dixie down the street but they lack the selection of their competitor.\n\nIf you want to go to a better location check out the Rouses on Airline Hwy in Metarie. The problem I have with this particular rouses is that it has more of a closed in feeling to it. It just doesn't seem the same as all the other Rouses I go to.\n\nIn short its alright to check this one out if you live in the Mid City area. But still not my favorite Rouses Location.",

    "text": "Surprise to see so many 5 stars.  I went in with high expectations and was sadly disappointed.  I gave this place two visits just in case the first time was just an off day. \nAllow me to explain!  Heading out for work, I had a craving for donuts. I typically do not eat sweets so early but chocolate glazed sounded good. Read good reviews and had to see for myself. Well, place is nothing  spectacular.   I was expecting full racks, shelves and trays stacked with goodies and glass display cabinets filled with cakes of all sorts. What I saw, instead, were half empty racks, table of cookies had few selections and atmosphere did not have the great aroma of a fresh bakery. And to top it off, my cashier very young lady was not that friendly. Did not even make eye contact as she accepted my payment.  Like I said, maybe just an off day! \nSo I return another day. And, this time it was in the afternoon. Did not see another customer so I figured quick service. Well, three employees were there talking fairly loud. One acknowledged my presence and gave me a greeting. She had to get through two other employees deep in their loud conversation. The lady taking my order had to asked me twice what I said.  She would apologize for not hearing me the first time as she also apologized for the loud noise coming from the other two.  I got my order and went on my way. \nThe donuts are ok.  I could buy from grocery store and be just as satisfied. I would visit again just to try other items. I do support local family businesses so give this place a try.",

We were seated outside, which I loved.\n\nService was 'so-so'.  3 requests for iced tea with 'lemon'..before the lemon actually appeared.  Friendly?  No so much.  Attentive....average in every way.  \n\nFrench onion soup was good, but my entree was very disappointing.  I ordered the shrimp and grits (large).  The shrimp were great, but there was barely a tablespoon of grits to be found on the plate.  Conversely, there was a unbelievable amount of sauce.  It appeared more like SOUP when delivered, and all my table mates comment.  Wow!  There was enough sauce for 3 entrees on my plate.  I ate the shrimp....looked for a bit of 'grits', and pushed my soup to the side.  Very strange.  \n\nI was not impressed....but will likely try again.  I loved Herbies in their old location, so i am assuming my dinner was an exception to their regular service.",

    "text": "It was difficult for me to give this place 3 instead of 4 stars because in my heart I really do like this place and I'll definitely be back. However, I think that there is plenty of room for improvement. As a donut shop, their selection was disappointingly slim as well as their portions. The flavor is GOOD, but the process with which they make the donuts differ from what you'd expect (i've had plenty of donuts across this great country, and these are different) and different may be better/worse depending on your palate. They taste more like a cupcake than a donut, in my opinion. Not a bad thing, just different than what I'm used to and what I was expecting. \n\nNonetheless, I really enjoyed my experience. The staff is SUPER FRIENDLY and helpful. The coffee and tea are from local businesses in Tampa, which I really appreciate. And the restaurant is nicely decorated and laid out. The atmosphere fits in with the standard of the Wesley Chapel area. \n\nBut at the end of it all, when I go to a donut shop that had been rated highly by others, I have high expectations. The sever lack of selection and portion for the price keeps me from giving this place a solid 5. Despite it all, I will return because I do like this place.",

    "text": "I hadn't been back to Gulifity's in years. Growing up in the area, it was always a compromise destination one of the few places that was more than eating in a bar, but less than a fancy night out. I remember an unfocused menu and a dining room awkwardly subdivided. Since then, they've renovated and overhauled their menu. The dining room is now wide open, with a row of banquettes separating it from the bar area. It retains the smaller seating area by the entrance, and has added a large outdoor bar. \n\nI ended up there twice in recent months. The first I met up with people for happy hour. We started outside, gathered around a long hightop table. There was a good selection of beers out there, though different from inside. There was adequate shade for the late afternoon sun, but the humidity got to be a bit much, as with any outdoor bar. Once everyone showed up, we decided to move inside.\n\nThe bar is downstairs from the main entrance, and our large group colonised the large high-top in the middle of the bar area. It had some of those self-service taps you sometimes see at large sportsbars, but we didn't try them out. The beer list inside was much more expansive, with plenty of choices for all tastes. There's also a large variety of appetizers. I had the buffalo chicken dip, with pita wedges, and also tried some buffalo popcorn chicken and  alligator tacos, and everything was pretty good.\n\nI went back a few weeks later for dinner. We sat in the dining area, in a slightly uncomfortable highbacked booth. We started with the calimari, which were lightly breaded and crispy, but may have too many mini-squid and too few rings for some tastes. I had an apple burger, which was a nice twist on the usual bacon bleu burger. I also tried some of the buffalo fajita, which was pretty spicy.",

    "text": "As a vegetarian who prefers to eat gluten-free, I know I'm not the easiest customer for a restaurant to please. Still, this place has a little room for improvement, so I thought I'd mention my experiences here.\n\nNot wanting to eat meat, fish, or gluten, I made a meal out of half an app and a small entree. My food was tasty: the grilled avocado app was very good, though it definitely needed a light sprinkle of salt, and there was none on the table. Our server disappeared for such long stretches of time that I didn't want to wait and just ate it sans salt. My small (read: very small) salad entree was listed as beets, arugula, cheese, and almonds. I got an unexpected upgrade to pine nuts instead of almonds. I'm not complaining, but it would have been nice to be notified of changes to the dish I was ordering. \n\nA word of advice to gluten-free customers: After ordering I later learned that there was a risotto dish under the \"pasta\" section of the menu. Since I avoid most gluten, I didn't even look at the pasta. Strange that they would put a risotto dish there. Also, the dessert menu has many (three I think?) gluten-free options including a gluten-free brownie sundae. It clearly mentions gluten-free on the dessert menu. However their main menu never once mentions gluten-free options or uses GF icons or anything. \n\nMy boyfriend's trout meal was disappointing. It was served skin side up (a bit unusual?) and said it came with potatoes and a pea puree. His peas were whole, not pureed, and the potatoes were nearly raw. Not just al dente. Basically just off-raw.\n\nThe server was very sweet, but not quite as present as he could have been, as our water glasses went unfilled for long stretches.",

They were out of thighs, she was tying to be creative and fix it, like give me back my order and give me 2 extra legs to make up for it, which I was fine with so I wouldn't have to wait 8 minutes for fast food. We were having a conversation and he just took the 8 piece box of chicken and threw it in the trash, saying the boss was watching him on the camera and he \"can't give food away\". But the real problem was how he didn't even talk to her or me, assumed the worst, and the proceeded to talk about it to another person as if me and the worker weren't listening to every word. That was rude and I felt really bad for her, she shouldn't be treated like that in front of customers, and I should be spoken to, not at. If you can't trust your employees to make your customers happy or fix their mistakes, then why would I want to come back?",

The only issue was once we were done with the tequila our server was supposed to get us margaritas with our choice of tequila. She was so busy that we never got the chance to really flag her down. Not the end of the world, partially our fault. \n\nMoving on.\n\nThe quacamole was so buttery! We just ordered it sort of plain with jalapenos, cilantro and tomatoes. \n\nI got the empanada app which was very good. The chicken inside had a lot of flavor and the crust was perfectly crusty. I got the short ribs for my main and forgive me because I forget what it came with, but everything was good. Definitely a solid three for the dinner.\n\nThe dessert was just weird. I wanted to be adventurous. But I guess sweet/spicy sauce and chocolate just don't do it for me. I took one taste of the chocolate tart and instantly wanted to vomit. That has never happened to me before and I was embarassed by my poor choice!!!

The food however is meh.  If you have a hankering for deep fried seafood, this is your place.  Coming from the East Coast, we have some killer seafood \"shacks\" and  less is more when it comes to fresh seafood.  \nWe shared an order of the coconut shrimp which was second to the garlic clams that they were out of.  The shrimp were fat and succulent, but heavy with oil, as well as the onion rings.  It was served with a bright red dipping sauce that was watery and had he flavor of KoolAde-NOT GOOD.  After minutes of trying to figure out the artificial flavor that was so overpowering, we came to the conclusion that it was the juice from the bottle of Maraschino cherries.  \nThe side of coleslaw was ok, very light on the mayo and sprinkled with pineapple and raisins. Refreshing against the heavily oiled shrimp.\nI glanced over at the crab cakes that my friend had ordered and it looked quite dense and heavily breaded.  This is not your Maryland Crab cake, which in my opinion is the best.  Why cover up the sweet rock crab that is literally pulled out of the fresh water a stones throw away?!!\nGranted I did not have anythings else here, but if you can't execute a simple fried plate of seafood, it may set the stage for the rest of the menu. It will curb your hunger while you take in the stunning ocean.",

    "text": "I've been here several times throughout the years. This year marks their 25th Anniversary- congratulations!  When I was a kid it was called Ron's School House, but they've changed the name. My family and I came tonight to celebrate my brother's birthday. We had a nice time, were seated quickly, service was friendly and attentive and we learned quickly that some of us should have stuck with what they are known for and not ventured into the extravagant choices of the menu. My brother got a Philly chicken cheese steak and a side of fire grilled vegetables, both of which he's had before and no complaints there. My Dad ordered an American meal- Chicken breast with a side of mashed potatoes and broccoli and also a caesar side salad. He liked his meal. My mom and I both ordered the eggplant parmasean dish with a side of spaghetti.. the noodles were slightly overcooked and the marinara sauce was very bland. I tried doctoring it up by adding grated table cheese, it helped a little.. but no basil or any other spices or flavoring.. disappointed in that. The actual eggplant.. where was it? It was heavily breaded and the eggplant was so thin I practically had to get a magnifying glass out to see it. Also it was fried, and covered it cheese- the cheese was probably the best part. It was so heavy from being fried and breaded. One thing I did enjoy though was I got the butternut, nutmeg, pumpkin soup for an extra $2. The soup was hearty, filling and sweet.\n\nIf you've never visited Ron's, i'd recommend sticking to the Ovals- pizza, which is what they're known for. I enjoyed the soup too, so check that out. Prices range from $8-17 for lunch and dinners. They also have a bar which stays pretty packed. We went tonight for dinner around 6 and the bar was already full by then and the dining rooms were filling up fast.",

As soon as we walked in, the atmosphere was noticeably cheery and welcoming. However as we sat at our booth waiting for food, the noise level became offputting. We had to practically yell across the table to have a conversation. Price wise it was too expensive considering the price to portion ratio. I got the number 6 breakfast special and was disappointed by the lack of food. I finished my plate in less than ten minutes and was  still hungry. I don't know if we will come back again, I think we can find a cheaper place to eat with greater food portions. Also, space was definitely an issue; there was barely enough room for the waitress to carry her serving tray. Overall the establishment was clean, organized, friendly, and well run.",

I haven't experienced consistency with meat here; it's always at least decent, but some times are certainly more overcooked than others. The sauce is a little underwhelming; a lot of BBQ places focus on either serving really good meat or really good sauce; while I certainly agree that the meat is the one to pick if you could truly only pick one, but why not both?? My take on the sides is mixed: the mac-n-cheese is killer and the cornbread is cool, but the cole slaw and veggie sides...ehh. Actually, the cole slaw is just bizarre; I think they were trying to be outside-the-box with the flavors, but something made it really watery. Furthemore, as many folks have pointed out, the portions are stingy. \n\nMy take: you're only 1.2 miles away from Bacon and Caviar, make that your stop instead! Garlic cheese grits await you...",

Probably the most hipster restaurant I've been to in Reno, but I would not recommend this place if you're trying to have an intimate date night. The music in the restaurant is super loud. \n\nService: After my boyfriend and I were seated, it took the waiter at least 15 minutes to get us water. The food took a long time to come out and our main dishes came out at different times. After finishing dinner, we asked for the check and I think the waiters completely forgot about us because we had to wait another 10-15 minutes. I would expect restaurants to want to turn tables over quickly, but for some reason service was super slow. For the poor customer service and overall dining experience, three stars.\n\nFood: Tried the crab croquet. Pretty tasty, but I don't think it warrants the high price tag. Three crab croquets for $13 is a little steep.\n\nAlso had the spicy miso ramen ($16) and the wicked fried rice with duck cracklings ($14). I'd say the ramen here is probably better than other places I've been to in Reno, but nearly double the price. The broth wasn't super rich, but presentation and little vegetables were nice. The wicked fried rice was pretty good. The cracklings definitely add texture and the duck on top was cooked well.",

You order your food first, pay for your individual meal which I loved and then grab a table. One of the servers informed us by the time we placed our order there would be tables for us and that was true. I was shocked because of how crowded the place was. I ordered the American special of eggs, bacon, grits and pancakes that was delicious. I tasted one of my friends chocolate pancakes which was different but a bit too much chocolate for breakfast in my opinion.\n\nThis place really deserves 4 stars but their unpreparedness for a large crowd during a popular festival weekend warrants a deduction. They ran out of flatware and some of the juice and tea dispensers were empty. I informed staff and they sincerely apologized and stated they would get to it.They definitely needed more staff. The other thing I didnt like was that you waited in line in the middle of the restaurant and can be literally breathing on  other patrons eating their food. Well that's how it felt and it was just too tight and the set up wasnt comfortable at all.",

Its spacious, and we had no problem getting seated even though the place was packed. The food however left a bit to be desired. Upon initial arrival I was expecting some sort of artisanal bread, focaccia, or bruschetta, but instead we got a bland oversized roll with no olive oil or pesto sauce for dipping (which is common in Italian restaurants).  We experimented with the polenta fries, and they were not good (but I've never had them before so take that with a grain of salt). The scallop and risotto was just ok, I was expecting a better dish and I'd give it a 6/10. The other dishes ordered were the manicotti, and the chicken parm which both proved to be average in flavor and quality. You could easily get better quality from a local pizzeria. The side of meatballs was anticlimactic, borderline bland as hell.  Nothing was overwhelmingly horrible, but I expected more considering all the hype. In my opinion, at present, I'd prefer a trip to Olive Garden. Hopefully they management has a chance to consider some of these reviews and adjusts the menu a bit.",

They seemed to be a man down for a while and it really showed, but on the otherhand, when our waiter arrived he was really cool, helpful and took GREAT care of us.\n\nThen the food had two hands too.  On one the food was decent, and nothing to really complain about, standard bar fare with a really tasty item called the chingalinga I think.  But on the otherhand it was 'merkinized mexican bar food.  One thing we for sure will get next time will be the grilled chicken nachos instead of the shredded chicken.  Just too bland.\n\nThe drinks also had some duality.  We had two of the special drinks and those were really good.  But my standard bloody mary was so lame that the waiter took it on himself to make me one with much more flavor.  I know, I know bloody mary requests at a Cantina?  \n\nThe atmosphere in the bar is actually nice and open when we went.  It seems lots of the Victorian bars have this same vibe.  \n\nAnd thankfully the prices during happy hour were really good.  So good I think the next time I am looking for a friendly place to have a few drinks with people in Sparks, I will scoot on down for their happy hour for sure.\n\nParking may be a little tight during busy times, but when we went, parking was right out front and plentiful across the street.",

    "text": "In desire of gastropub fare, but tired of our usual haunts, a few friends and I ventured to Pub and Kitchen (19th and Lombard). I had been to the former restaurant, Chaucer's, once before, and the transformation was drastic. Pub and Kitchen has been able to achieve lighting nirvana in their small space, creating a warmth that filters throughout. Service was quick and attentive without being overbearing. But on to the food.\n\nI highly recommend trying the Bar Snacks, which are a steal at $3 a pop. We sampled the duck liver pate and fish mop rolls. The latter were delicious. If memory and taste serve me correctly, it was some kind of white fish combined with a creme fraiche accompanied by potatoes and herbs on crusty bread, all of which is underscored by a hint of citrus. The flavors are sophisticated and complex. Two large pieces come to an order.\n\nEntrees: I was in the mood to go light, so I ordered the onion soup ($8) with a side of brussels sprouts ($5). What made the onion soup distinct was the addition of some kind of wheat beer (I think) to the broth, which stood up to the strength of the cheese and paired well with the sweet, caramelized onions. My only complaint: some of the cheese on top of the soup burned at the edges under the broiler. My side of brussels didn't achieve as high marks. The brussels were overcooked as well as the accompanying bacon. The flavors hit the mark, blending well, but the execution fell short.\n\nWe had also ordered the fish and chips, an altogether unspectacular dish, especially considering the steep price tag: $16-18 (don't remember exactly). The chips lacked a certain crispness, adding to the overall ineptitude. Also ordered was the steak and potatoes ($22). Not more perfectly could the steak be cooked! Rare, au poivre, and blissful. Not as much could be said of the potatoes, done in a hash brown/latke style, which seemed old and overdone.\n\nIn all, a pleasurable experience with exceptional flavor and ambiance; however, echoing other reviews, the actual cooking has yet to find its groove. Potatoes and brussels, especially at this price point, should be done without error. This has yet to happen.\n\nTo sit at the bar with a drink and \"bar snack\" before venturing out for the evening--yes, this would be delightful and really the most prudent of actions.\n\nCiao\nrwf",

    "text": "Increasing to 3 stars.  This is a build your own bowl. That being said it leads the customer to believe they know what they're eating. The cooks will load your bowl with a sugar-laden sauce if you don't monitor them.  Even after learning to ask for no sauce they still do it if you don't remind them.  \n\nOverall a good place for a cheap meal.  The employees will argue with you over your sides as well. I've been ripped off several times. I ask for extra bread and no soup or rice and I'm repeatedly charged for the extra or they argue with me until I don't get it. This doesn't make for a fair or consistent food value and it's highly irritating but there is obvious lack in training and  customer courtesy.  They're getting better but don't expect anything to be consistent or fully honest.  I walk out if I visit and the staff isn't who I want to deal with; it's that bad. I don't want to squabble over bread. They've probably lost $110 from me walking out before ordering just because I don't want to deal with the staff on duty. \n\nI always go back as I like it when they get it right. Honestly, I've been overcharged and/or cheated out of my sides 8-10 times. They refuse to make it up to you.",

    "text": "It's a classic New Orleans restaurant, known for BBQ Shrimp and classic Shrimp & Grits (among other things).  Ambiance is nice, service is extremely professional and quite good at understanding each table's needs, so my overall experience has been pretty good on a couple visits.  Cocktails and wine list are good, and they even dealt well with a nice bottle of wine I brought to complement those we bought for a larger work dinner.  Everything was quite nice on my most recent visit from food to service to overall atmosphere.\n\nThe issue I had is that myself and two other co-workers who ate the shrimp & grits all came down with clear food poisoning symptoms after eating here.  This was the only meal and common food item shared between the three of us, and it's clear that Mr. B's was the issue.  Understandably, this was the night after the hurricane that closed down the city on a Saturday night so I have to think this contributed to some food ordering and storage issues for a number of restaurants in town.  However, it's much less understanding when it's you who is sick for days afterward, or in this case my boss who had to finish up a conference and fly home on the evening after his symptoms hit.  Not fun at all.\n\nIn theory, Mr. B's is a good choice for classic New Orleans food.  In reality, I don't think I will be able to go back for a long time.  The bad experience was probably due to extenuating circumstances from the hurricane but regardless it seems that a professional kitchen needs to be able to do better.",

    "text": "Let's see..where to start...To begin with there was a line outside. Today was a cold breezy yet sunny day, so it was somewhat bearable to wait outside. There was a 25-30 min wait, which i endured because my friend wanted to really try it. Honestly, I get real leary when I see lines outside of certain restaurants, especially in Houston and New Orleans because I have learned that it's not always about the hype. With so many eateries in places like New Orleans and Houston, it's hard for me to actually wait in a long line. There have been times that I have seen the long lines for restaurants, and the food was subpar- this was one of those occasions. For starters, the host was welcoming, and the other waitresses seemed friendly, but not ours. Let's call her \"Marie.\" Marie, seemed like the classic example of trying to help a meth head out and give them a job. She was unattentive, rude and lack of understanding. First, we asked what were the choices for the \"entree + two sides options,\" on the menu and she started listing the sides. I asked her if there was a menu to read what the sides are, and she said that was the list. Ok. Before we could ask anything else she drifted off somewhere else and we had to bring her back. Basically, you're kinda forced to get the buffet option because if she get the entree you're limited to what you can get even though other food choices are available on the buffet. Bright side, if you go with the buffet you will get a chance to sample some of their popular items. \nMoving on, we got our tea which was PHENOMENAL. I'd say crack tea because it was hard to just NOT keep drinking it. Aside from that, I got the fried chicken, green beans, gumbo and stuffed bell peppers. You also get the choice of an omelette or french toast-tried the French toast as well. Once we got our drinks and started eating- Ol Marie went missing for awhile. We needed refills, napkins, and clearing our table of empty plates,  but she was nowhere to be found. Other waiters had to step in to clear our table. We were getting ready to leave but wanted more tea, so we asked if we could get a refill,and she just walked off without acknowledging if she heard us or not. We also wanted to know if we could get it to go. Then all of a sudden she reapppeared pouring tea which she sloppily wasted on the table and my purse-no words or apology. I told her we were trying to inform her that we wanted them to go AND the bill split, but yet again she walked off without acknowledging if she heard everything. She returned with plastic cups. The cups were dusty to the point you could wipe your finger over and see the residue- no thank you. Marie also brought back the bill without it being split as we asked. When we reminded her of our request, she rudely Replied \"we dont split checks but you could simply divide it.\" Boyyy it took everything in me not to go off. I told her \"we're fully aware of how to do math, however we asked for separate bills in which you never told us that it was a policy to not separate the tab.\" AT this point the owner nearby could see our frustration and his as well, in which he told her \"all you have to is seperate it out, no big deal.\" This was too confusing for Ms. Marie, in which the owner had to further explain. Eventually she just took three seperate payments. smh. \nOverall, the food and experience was \"OK.\" I had to add some salt and pepper to some of my food, which is a red flag considering it seems to be a well known NOLA spot. Honestly, the fried chicken from Willie's was waaaay better. Can't say I'd return, but I can cross this off my list.",

    "text": "Going into the old Chuck E. Cheese on Speedway evoked indelible childhood memories:  eating my very first piece of pepperoni pizza, sugar-fueled birthday parties with friends, and lots of Ms. Pacman.  Those same awkwardly creepy, soda-drenched, matted fur animatronic characters still performed for the birthday partiers.  Other than transitioning from '60s songs to '90s music, not much had changed in the last thirty years.  I guess it was time for an update, right across the street.\n\nThe good stuff:\n\nThe \"sticky\" factor is gone, since the tables, carpet and paint on the walls are brand new.   The well-lit dining area is rectangular with no tube running along the top, which makes it a lot easier to keep track of the kids.  Some new attractions have been added, including an elevated, life-size rocking-horse. Flat screen TVs have replaced Chuck E and the gang.\n\nThe \"meh\" stuff:\n\nThe only tables that seat more than four people are in the reserved area.  Unlike before, our group of 6 had to sit at separate tables.  The games are right next to the tables, so we had to shout to be heard over the clamor.  Chaos reigned on this Saturday afternoon, leaving my nerves jangling.  By the time we left, I had a raging headache...vowing never to return.  (I will.)\n\nI forgot to see if the new location has beer or not.  What the hell was I thinking?  That might have turned this into a four star review.\n\nWithout the nostalgia factor, Chuck E Cheese becomes pretty average for an adult.  The kids loved it (hence the two extra stars), but I'd much rather go to Peter Piper Pizza.",

I'd say it's pretty packed for a weekday. There was a 30 minutes wait for outside seating so we decided to take inside instead. \n\nWas craving for some oysters so i tried their oyster shooters. Hmm definitely too sour for me. It was really just okay. I got their crab cake. Came with onion rings and salad. My sister got their fried calamari, shrimp, scallops, and oysters. Also came with onion rings and salad. Love their fried calamari and oysters! \n\nTheir foods are okay. Service is very attentive and friendly :) But I think this place is overrated. I would come back for the view and fried calamari.",

    "text": "It absolutely pains me to write a poor review of Mr. B's Bistro.  I have been a loyal patron for more than 20 years.  I proposed to my wife there, and it holds a special place in my heart.\nI have always gone there for the service even more so than the food.  I used to find their service better than practically anywhere else.  Not anymore.\nWe had a 9pm reservation for five, arrived early and sat/stood in the bar area.  It took 20 minutes to finally get a drink (in a plastic cup).  We were seated about 9:20 and given water and menus, then ignored until 9:40.  Our waiter (who reeked of cigarettes)  took our order 1 appetizer, 1 cocktail, 1 glass of wine.\nThe martini was not what I requested, and the pork belly was one of the worst I've had...ever.\n40 minutes had passed before we received our order. Empty, unfilled water glasses, appetizer plate not picked up.  We wanted wine, but our waiter was nowhere to be found. When our food arrived, my scallops were room temp, my wife's steak was medium (not medium rare) with dry flavorless potatoes.  I mean, they were awful. The Gumbo Ya Ya was tasty, but not very warm. They brought the wrong order to my daughter who ordered salmon, with ZERO apologies.\nWe proceeded to finish our meal completely before they brought the salmon to her.  So we sat and watched her eat, again with nothing to drink and no waiter.\nI tasted her over cooked salmon which lacked much flavor.  I asked for the bill, expecting to see an adjustment or at least some remorse from our waiter...but neither happened.  It took quite some time to receive it (from another person).\nIt was supposed to be a special night (renewing vows), but will be tarnished by bad service and subpar food.  For $250, and one of my favorite places...I was more than let down.\nThere are far too many other great restaurants to choose from in NOLA to put up with an experience like that.",

And it had flavors that played well together. \n\nThe Bad:\nBland was a reoccurring theme. Some of the rolls were ok but most where just absolutely flavorless (mango tango or whatever was just foam. Mango had no flavor) And I mean lemon n spice are flavors but you can't run a restraunt on 2 flavors. \n\nOverall I want to give them another chance and I hope I will get some more flavor if not I'll take a bunch of kei tunas.",

We ordered a bottle and after he poured the three glasses he took the bottle off the table which is completely inappropriate . We ended up only ordering guacamole and chips and ate dinner elsewhere. It's too bad that this menu was so fussy and overpriced because the decor was really cute and really nice. I loved the dim lighting and the upstairs seating but I just did not want to stay there.

    "text": "Celebrating its 25th anniversary in 2015, Broad Ripple Brewpub is known as Indiana's first brewpub.  The Brewpub looks like a typical English pub on the inside with dark wood paneling, a tin ceiling, and even a fireplace.  Plus, it has a large patio that can seat up to seventy people during nice weather.  Broad Ripple Brewpub has a diverse menu and several of their own beers on tap to compliment nearly anything you choose.  They offer various starters, salads, sandwiches, burgers, pasta and classic pub entrees such as fish and chips and bangers and mash.  Thankfully I scanned the entire menu as the very last item on it happened to be pizza!  \n\nBroad Ripple Brewpub has a few of their own pizza creations to choose from, but I ordered a more basic sausage and pepperoni one.  My pizza ended being much better than I expected for something listed last on their menu.  The thin crust was cooked in a way that it allowed it to be somewhat firm but not charred, and I liked that.  It had a good amount of cheese without me ordering extra, and I also liked the way it was cooked to a golden brown.  The sauce and meats didn't stand out as much, but there was nothing wrong with either of them.  If everything listed on Broad Ripple Brewpub's menu before the pizza is even better than it, then I need to have many more meals there and I recommend others do the same.  As a cheese lover, I had to sample their cheese curds in addition to my pizza and will say that they were pretty tasty, so I haven't found anything I don't like on their menu yet!",

    "text": "If I could give half stars, I'd want to give 3.5 here. It's definitely not yet at 4, but more than 3, no doubt. \n\nI was super excited when I found out about this restaurant. Being from Dallas, one of the big voids I felt here in St. Louis was the lack of proper crawfish, so when news broke of this place, I rejoiced. After having the crawfish, I remain cautiously optimistic. That having been said, I won't rave and say this place is amazing, because it isn't. Not yet. However, I see much potential here. I got 2 lbs of crawfish, corn, and Cajun fries. The corn was sweet and juicy and perfectly soaked up all the juice from my boil bag. The shoestring fries were crispy and seasoned just right. The crawfish was good. Not great, but good. I was disappointed at the flavor. I opted for the whole sha-bang (obvi the only way to go!) and went with mild on the spice level (my general spice tolerance is pretty low), afraid that anything higher that mild would make my nose leak and my lips burn. However, the mild was, in fact, extremely mild. I tried my fianc\u00e9's top level spicy crawfish, and even that was doable. I think they could probably afford to go more heavy handed with the spice on the flavor, and really kick it up a couple notches with the heat. I must admit, though, that the buggers that were sitting and marinating at the bottom of the bag were quite flavorful and succulent, so that was a plus. Also, mopping up each crawfish in the remaining juice also helped with the flavor. \n\nIf crawfish isn't your thing, they have crab, oysters, shrimp, and other options. Shrimp basket was fantastic; one thing I generally dislike about fried food is all the breading. The shrimp here were crisp with minimal breading, and the flavor was spot on. Interior is nice and spacious, and there is ample spaces to park. Extra points for having sinks in the back of the restaurant, outside of the restroom area, so you can quickly wash all the crawfish juice from your hands. \n\nI remain highly optimistic for this place. Will I go back? 100%. Do I recommend it? Yes, definitely give it a try. I am hoping that with some time, the flavors will really develop and I will really, really be mad for the Mad Crab!",

I think it's pretty average frozen custard with standard toppings.  I do like some of their specialty treats like the Big Apple and the Hawaiian.\n\nBUT - the main reason for this mediocre review is their false claims about their famous concretes.  Never do I have a worker actually flip my concrete upside down....probably because if they did it would all spill out.  Now, I can grant them some reprieve if I order a concrete on a 90 degree night in July.  I can see why the custard wouldn't be hard as a rock.  However, what's the excuse when I went in February and still got a half melted concrete?!  Not worth the hype.",

Then ordered the mapo tofu, fried pork bao and the eggplant and pork.\nWhat a disappointment.  The tofu while a large enough portion had very little flavor!  We ordered it with pork and it had maybe 5 little pieces of ground pork.  We kept adding spices and soy to get some flavor.  Then while the eggplant had good flavor, it was a bit undercooked and also, where's the pork?  I have never seen less meat in a dish that advertised meat!  Never!

Before I write a full review I will say the food was great, but the service sub-par.  \n\nThe first thing we noticed as we walked in was a sign in sheet and there were only 4 names in front of us, we figured it shouldn't take very long, plus there are 2 tables open that just need to be cleared.  About a half hour passed and we were still waiting and only one of the two tables had been cleared.  Finally after an hour of waiting we were seated.  Soon after being seated we were able to order and the service got better.  As we were waiting, we were never greeted or offered any kind of beverage which certainly would have raised my rating.  A suggestion would be to have somebody host and at least give you some idea of how long you are going to be waiting.\n\nThe noise level is very high because its such a large room and terrible acoustics, so you have to talk at a high level.  The decor in the place is awesome with old vespa like scooters hanging from the ceiling, old bikes, toys, coke signs, etc.  The tables have toys and games on display under glass which is really cool.  \n\nNow for the food.  Great! I loved the pizza.  We also had breadsticks, great, and a greek salad that we loved.  A small salad was big enough for two of us.  We got the The Cappy that was New York Style and would certainly recommend.  We will definitely be going back to try the Chicago style, but probably not on a Friday night. \n\nIt's possible that it was an off night, maybe someone called in sick?  It looked like there were only 2 waitresses for the whole place and it was a Friday night.\n\nOverall, mediocre experience, great food, and we will be going back to give another shot.",

Service. BYOB.\nNo points: A bit pricey for what you get.",

There is a full bar, with 5 or 6 beers on tap, which was nice, but the bar itself could have used one more television.  We were sitting on the opposite end, and had to crane our necks.  My husband had a Reuben, which he said was very good, and I tried the Fina sandwich, which had potential.  The Fina was turkey and ham on a toasted roll with a nice honey mustard and onions.  The flavors were great together, but boy was it salty!  Almost too salty to eat!  We also split an order of fries, which were ok, but got cold almost immediately.  We'll probably give it another try during football season, but this isn't a restaurant I would go out of my way to visit.",

Chill atmosphere, lots of TVs, good mix of folks, and cheap artery-clogging grub. And yet, the defining feature of the place -- the one thing that came to represent our entire visit -- was that it is a smoking bar. I figured that meant that some people might smoke, but no, that means that ALL the people WILL DEFINITELY smoke. A lot. Too much for me. This joint was a chimney. \n\nI thought about giving it two stars, but that seems unfair, because it is what it is. Just because it ain't my cup of tea doesn't mean I should give it a poor rating. For other people, this place will certainly be a gem. If you want to smoke in a bar, this place should probably get 4 or 5 stars, because everything else about the place is pretty cool, and there probably aren't many other places out there that still let you light up.",

Something about dining there just makes you feel less connected to the normal energy and flow of the place. \n\nThe beer selection is small but tastefully chosen.  They always seem to have Old Speckled Hen on tap.  I've never had a problem ordering drinks even on packed bar nights.\n\nIf you're eating at P&K then you definitely want to have the burger.  It's pretty ridiculously awesome.  I've had it three times now and it never disappoints me or any of the people I've dragged their with me.  I've had the mussels as well and they were nomtastic.  I have a feeling that all of their food is spot on and there's not a bad thing on the menu.\n\nI knock them down a couple stars because times I have gone there it has either been so packed that it wasn't worth the wait or because one hot summer evening I tried to go there and either they weren't running the AC or they didn't have any.  Needless to say, I had to leave.  It was just too hot in there to enjoy any food.\n\nThey don't take reservations which just bothers me. For me, if I know where I'm going in advance, I want to call and have a table reserved for me.  From the restaurant's standpoint I'm sure they don't want to book up there tables for a bunch of no shows.  I guess it's just crappy because I feel that their level of food is of the quality where I should be able to reserve a table.\n\nI will make return trips.  It's always a nice place to stop in.  Maybe I just need to go some more. I really want to give it more stars, I just can't right now.",

We didn't mention this to our server until the end of the meal, at which point the manager came over and had those two entrees removed from our bill.\n\nService overall was not up to my expectations  Our server only checked on us once during the course of the meal, and a folding tray twice crashed to the floor near us, this should have been fixed after the first occurrence.\n\nOverall, the food rated 3 stars, minus another star for the service, plus a star for adjusting our bill.  Given the number of \"star\" restaurants in New Orleans, it's doubtful if the Besh offerings will be a priority for me in future visits.",

The wait staff was extremely friendly and even brought out four sauces for my friend and I to try before choosing our meals. They joked around with us as well which is always appreciated  however, overall I found the meal very lackluster. The sauce was delicious when I tried it, but not strong in the actual meal. I suppose more would have helped, or less noodles. I was also craving more veggies in my bowl. The honey bar idea is also very cute (unless you assume it comes with yogurt so you don't actually get it as a \"topping\" and end up with a bowl of toppings... Obviously my fault there). And I found the place fairly pricey as well. I would try it out again but maybe go a different route is all.",

Everything was tasty but the service left a lot to be desired. Our food was thrown on the table as our waitress did a drive by and that was the last we saw of her until our bill showed up. I had asked for honey mustard but was given BBQ sauce. After waiting about 10 minutes for our waitress I finally got someone else's attention and by now we needed drink refills too. The other girl got my honey mustard and our drinks. Even then our waitress can be seen on the other side of the restaurant or behind the bar but not near our table.  Finally after I stacked all the dirty dishes up she did another drive by to drop the bill.  \n\nOnly in the area another week. Probably won't be back. Would have been fine with a better waitress.",

It's a shame it is gone but hopefully Square Peg can pick up where Marathon left off. \n\nLuckily there is still this location serving about the same menu. One of my teams  had a gift card that was long overdue to take advantage of so we set out here for lunch. Unfortunately they do not take reservations for groups at lunch so the 9 of us had to roll the dice. It was packed so the best they could do was two back to back booths after a 15 minute wait. This wasn't so bad except in the back left hand corner there is a ton of noise coming from behind a faux wall (that gets hot also) with dish washing in full effect. \n\nNonetheless our service was great as we spent about 1.5 hours here. I had a 16 hour brisket sandwich special of the day that was delicious as the fries are nice and crispy. A solid plate for $10 but in general the menu does not have anything to get too excited about. Most of the other people got salads on this hot day which all looked tasty and fresh too. \n\nI would recommend this place for someone looking for a solid sit down lunch in Center City, but probably not for a true foodie.",

First time was one of the best meals I've had in a while, but the second was the most disappointing meal I've had in New Orleans.  \n\nTo start, getting a table for 5 on a Saturday at 8:30PM was pretty miserable.  We were told to \"check back every 10 minutes\" for a starting 45 minute wait.  After 45 minutes, we were told to \"check back every 5 minutes.\"  Really?  Fine, food was awesome, we'll play your game (the live music venue beside them is awesome).  \n\nWe finally were seated, and ordered food.  It wasn't all bad, but it was definitely inconsistent and average at best.  Smoked salmon ravioli was completely saturated with dill, to the point of being one-note.  The gnocchetti sounded great on paper, but they forgot to put the panchetta, rendering the plate completely flavorless due to the lack of salt.  The duck in the duck pasta was completely overcooked to the point of nearly duck jerky.  The devils on horseback were soggy and overdone.  \n\nA few standouts though were the sliders and the deviled eggs, and the cocktails were delicious.  Maybe their chef was in the weeds or they had the B-squad in on a saturday night.  Either way, unfortunately I won't be going back after this one.  a 5* and a 2* experience don't lend me to trying for the \"3rd time's a charm\" experience.  sigh.",

But...\n\nWhile this Sephora generally has all of the things I want--rows and rows of shiny \"product,\" cute ladies in black outfits \"greeting\" me and offering me shopping baskets or testers, blah blah blah etc.--this Sephora does NOT have one of the things that I desire most about a Sephora: a diverse and well-stocked fragrance counter.\n\nOn one hand, I love that they're willing to put together multiple sample spritzers of cologne for me to take home to my boyfriend to spray them on him and see how they smell.  On the other hand, I can't believe how limited their selection is!  Gah!  \n\nI go to Sephora so I can smell things that are unfamiliar and try on perfumes that aren't as easy to come by.  I KNOW what Marc Jacobs smells like.  Fine.  Great.  Whatever.  I come to Sephora so I can sample limited edition Lulu Guiness or so I can see if I like the smell of a lesser-sold Agent Provacateur (i.e. not Matrisse or AP EDP).  Yeah, they have the newest big-name fragrances like the new Gucci or the new Calvin Klein... but I can probably find both of those at Macy's, too.  Sephora is a cosmetics store.  They're supposed to have all of the really good stuff.\n\nSigh... A poorly stocked Sephora is like an airport Barnes and Noble: convenient to have in an emergency but that's about it.  I suppose it's nice to go in and get a fix, but it's also like the worst tease ever.  I get that we live in the city and so they have limited square footage and all.. but still.  Again I say, this is Sephora.  Can't they buy some random store next door and expand or something?  Add on an upstairs?  Move in to the closing Loehmans?  I mean, we DO live in a city!

My wife and I swung by on our wedding day and they gave out whatever we wanted to our wedding party (and the photographer too). Good thing, since it was the hottest day of 2010.

Sadly, last time I ordered boba it was too mushy. It was near closing time, I don't know if that had anything to do with it.\n\nThere's a menu insert with newer items, I would skip it. Maybe some of the items are worth a shot but I'm too scared to try now. One night I ordered the Chicken Pan Fried noodle to go and, to my despair, it was not what I expected. I don't know what happened, in my mind the dish looked different, even the picture on the menu was different. I even wondered if it was a mistake. Imagine crispy deep fried noodles like the ones you put on top of a Chinese chicken salad drenched in a sauce with barely any chicken. Not the most pleasant experience.\n\nFor now, I'm sticking to the egg rolls, B\u00e1nh Mi sandwiches, Rice dishes, B\u00fan bowls, and Iced Coffee. I wish the broth was tastier... don't usually buy Pho here unless I'm craving a hot bowl of soup. I genuinely enjoy Vietnamese cuisine and crave it often, but some menu items here are a miss. I really like those places where the menu is small, but you know everything tastes amazing. This place has variety, but most dishes are mediocre. Alas!!!! I still come here. It's conveniently near campus and sometimes you need some egg rolls to get you through finals, right? ;-)",

    "text": "So, we had two different experiences here based on the servers.  We sat at the bar both times. The first night we had a gal that was fun, easy-going, helpful.  The person I was with got two sliders and she really liked the beef slider.  I got the meat pies, which were just okay...they tasted like they came out of a frozen box, but like a nicer brand, as opposed to... for example, Hot Pockets. Ha! Nothing wonderful, nothing terrible.  The drink that the bartender made was solid though.  \nThe second time we went there was a different bartender.  We were there on work, so we needed to stay within a certain budget with our food.  I ordered a slider (they have them as a single option) and a side of the brussel sprouts.  I specifically had pointed to the single slider on the menu when ordering.  When the food came out, it was the two slider meal option, and when I pointed it out (because of the work budget), it was just really awkward.  The bartender came out with an extra plate and proceeded to clear off the second burger and fries and take them in back... The slider was a better choice than the meat pies.  The brussel sprouts were good, but not great, a little greasy.  The environment is chill, relaxed, easy.  This place is not far from the convention center, so it's an easy walk after a long day there.  Obviously, take advantage of the Yelp free drink, and hope you get the female bartender, she's way more fun.",

However, the young waitress we had took her sweet time even getting to our table to take our drink orders. After we were seated the waitress took approximately 10 minutes to come to our table. And she was pretty standoffish thru out the entire meal. None the less, the food was great! I had the Philly cheesesteak wrap. It came with soup ( chicken gumbo) fries & cole slaw. It was delish!!!! My co-workers also enjoyed their food! This diner also has a large menu selection. The decor was reto fifties ( very cool!). I would def go again just hope the service is better the next time.",

The texture was good but it's just your typical cake doughnut that can be made at home if you had a fryer. They were all the same doughnuts with just a different sugar or glaze over it. I tried four flavors but none of them particularly stood out to me.\n\nThe fried chicken wasn't bad. It was moist, but again, nothing to rave about. It comes with a honey doughnut but I didn't get any pickles as stated on the online menu. I had a dry topping and a wet topping. For the dry topping, I chose the coconut curry. It tasted more like regular curry powder dusted over the chicken with no hints of coconut.  And the chicken \n\nComing from New York, I think everything was pretty reasonably priced.",

We ordered the choriqueso, and when it arrived, the waitress also brought a side of elote. We had not ordered it, but didn't really question it, thought maybe they were throwing it in as a sample, and we ate it. (It was on the bill later) We had finished it, and it was tasty, so we didn't complain. The queso and tortillas were quite good, though the serving could have been a bit larger. \n\nBetween the four of us, we ordered most of the meats on the menu in various forms: tacos, gorditas, tostadas, and a carne asana plate. When the food came, there were more things we didn't order, and we sent back. Of my 4 tacos, two were not what I ordered, but I was starving, so I ate them anyway. Son's carne asana was flavorful, but overlooked. Peach margarita was large and tasty, but had very little tequila!\n\nMy favorite was the tinga de pollo- the chicken was juicy and flavorful with just a bit of spice. (That taco alone made the visit worthwhile!)\n\nGot the bill, and we had been charged for the items we had not ordered, and sent back, and she had not taken off the discount for the Yelp check in, so we had to have that corrected. \n\nWe left full, and generally satisfied with the food.",

    "text": "I'm torn about this place. On the one hand, it brings back memories and occupies this rare spot in my mind where I can think about something related to high school and not suddenly become deeply depressed. My current relationship to the business stands with it being my favorite local pizza place, with some of the best topping combinations and quickest delivery around. Once an order came with pizza not how my mom wanted it, so I called to complain and they came right back soon after with a free replacement to make her happy. They also have coupons on (some of) their boxes...if I ever collect ten of them I can get a free pizza. \n\nOn the other hand, I feel a bit like I'm cheating on the place my family always orders from, which they prefer but I do not particularly enjoy. Also, I feel disappointed in myself AND the business, because I still stick with Lovecchio's through their seeming disdain and spitefulness - some nights I have called for delivery and I can hear the person pick up the phone and hang it up again. I'm not sure if they don't want business, if they're too busy, if the phone slipped...but I called back and it happened again. And then I called back to no answer. And then I called back a while later and they answered like nothing had ever happened. Also, another time I called and they were out of ingredients for one style of pizza (sausage - how do you run out of sausage?!). And finally, I drove by the location on my way home around 9pm one night they were supposed to still be open and they were shut; not sure if they closed early or were never open that day...\n\nWeird business practices, but really good pizza for the area.",

This is where I think Franklin's runs into trouble - it seems that they can't figure out what kind of restaurant they want to be. \n\nIf you take a quick glance at their menu, you'll notice that the prices are slightly high when considering this is the same place that has among the cheapest (and longest) happy hours that I've seen in a while, in addition to $2 Miller bottles all the time. They have Skee-Ball, basketball, and a golf game in one half of the restaurant, then they have a \"regular\" sit down part with the menu that I mentioned above. \n\nThe service is great, the manager is always friendly when I'm there, and the food is good....not great. I think they went overboard on the TV's, but that's just me. In addition, they have a good beer selection (including your usuals and some rotating micros/crafts). I think they need to decide, and pretty quickly, what kind of crowd they are going after and what kind of restaurant they are going to be. A combination of a sports bar and a nice sit-down restaurant just doesn't seem like it's going to work, especially considering where they are located (an out of the way location that's not going to get passerby traffic).",

The dough should be thinner. and a little bit too oily.\nCrispy Chicken with basil is very good! very flavorful and juicy. \nCrispy Pork Cutlet has the right balance of salty and sweetness.\n\nOverall very authentic in flavor and I like it.\nWhy 3 stars? because I am picky, and they can have improvements.",

    "text": "We expected a more formal restaurant, but that was perhaps our lack of planning/research.  It's fairly casual with upscale cuisine.  A friend recommended it to me.  I was disappointed, but I had been to a fantastic dinner at Ralph's On the Park the night before, so this comparison was rather stark.  \n\nThe waiter was very casual and seemed to know little about the menu.  We ordered the boudin noir.  Having lived in Louisiana during graduate school, we know a thing or two about boudin and were looking forward to it.  Must be good -- it's a John Besh restaurant, right?  Wrong.  The waiter could have told us that this boudin is blood sausage that keeps it REAL.  By keepin' it real, I mean there must have been a gallon of blood cooked down to make this sausage.  I know that some people like this, but come on, at least warn us.  It was inedible.  My husband asked for it to be removed from the table so that he could enjoy the rest of the food.\n\nFried oyster salad was very good, but it needed something to take it over the top.  Like a tangy bit of cheese, perhaps.  I'd still recommend it to you for a lunch.  Maybe you could ask for a little goat or bleu cheese with it!\n\nRaw oysters were, well, raw oysters.  They were excellent.  It was a bit of a challenge getting the crackers and cocktail sauce all together from a server.\n\nEtoufee of blue crab and brown shrimp on pasta was very good.  If you're expecting a normal etoufee, it's not that.  But I was not (I mean, it's on pasta and does not feature crawfish).  \n\nWe like to order mineral water at dinner.  This mineral water was keepin' it real, too.  It was drinkable, but I feel like they had something to prove with all this authentic, not-what-you'd-expect stuff.  Besh, I think that if you're going to surprise people with something they are not expecting, it should be fantastic and appealing to many people.\n\nI recommend that you go here for a lunch.  Order a salad or a burger/sandwich -- I saw them coming out, and they looked delicious.  Your tab will also be less than mine was if you are disappointed.",

    "text": "Came here for lunch on a weekday.  Ordered their lunch special of the day, which was a portabello spaghetti special.  Was angel hair pasta with chopped up portabello mushrooms and sundried tomatoes in an olive oil sauce with garlic.  Came with a garden salad.\n\nWhat's hot\n- Specials.  They have daily specials, which is cool.  Nice that they're working with the seasonal produce.\n- Price.  Reasonable.  You pay for what you get.\n- Service.  It looks like they're family owned and run.  Very nice wait staff.  Accommodating and attentive throughout the whole meal, which is nice.  No rush for you to get out.\n- Their salad isn't iceberg lettuce.  It was romaine lettuce with some onions, tomatoes, and olives.  You could tell they don't just throw whatever on there.  If a restaurant is using iceberg lettuce for their salad, that means they're lazy and cheap.  Iceberg lettuce has no flavor and no nutritional value.\n\nWhat's not\n- Their bread.  Some may not care about this, but dudes, bread is always important, especially for an Italian restaurant.  Doesn't look like it's fresh.  \n- Too much carbs.  I know, I know...  This is Italian food.  Dudes, my pasta dish had waay too much pasta.  The mushrooms and sun dried tomatoes were swimming in it.  A colleague's chicken sandwich had such thick bread.  He ended up putting aside most of the bread, because it was too much.  \n\nFinal Answer\nWilling to come back, but not my first pick.  Doesn't stand out.",

You were a creative restauranteur. You had a menu with interesting, tasty selections for four pages; not the two-sided, narrow piece of plastic laminate, franchise-quality flavored grease-food your restaurant now sells. Your beers are still good.  No doubt the new owner bought your brewing recipes in the sale, but your brewing competition in the St. Louis brewing community is at least your equal, now.

    "text": "This place...exists? It's in a building alongside Courtyard Caf\u00e9, underneath a UCSB parking lot past the Engineering building, oceanside. It's quite hard to find if you don't come regularly.\n\nAnyways when I ordered my beef a la carte (I'm on low carb), the cashier lady who didn't understand English very well tried to get my name for the order and it was a struggle. I had to spell out G-E-O-R-G-E three times before she just gave up and just spelt it as \"Georte,\" which was quite amusing in my opinion. At least after I waited for my name to be called, she stopped the cook from swindling me by switching the kiddie sized petri dish and hooking me up with a big takeout-sized platter of beef. Props for making up for the spelling mistake with lots of food. \n\nBack to the actual review. Most people don't know that this place even exists on campus, but all the engineering students like me, do. Even then, expect long lines of engineering peeps and the seats being mostly taken. However, the order was finished fairly quickly. \n\nMost of their items cost more than the Panda Express in the Hub, while portions are smaller. For example, the takeout plates that I saw were about half the size of what you'd get for a 2 entree 1 side Panda express, where you'd pay $7 to $9 for most entrees, or $5 for the a la carte that I got. \n\nBeef was pretty standard like other Yoshinoyas, it's kind of oily without the rice and noodles, but I like it greasy and tender as a Keto person. Comes with grilled onions. \n\nDecent place. Filled me enough, and the service was good in that one instance. I didn't like how the backroom chefs could be so stingy though.",

    "text": "I came here for brunch on a Saturday and was underwhelmed. Don't order the \"banana\" French toast; I had to ask our waiter if mine actually had bananas in it, and was told that bananas are \"in the dough.\" So...it was banana bread French toast, which sounds amazing, except there was zero banana flavor whatsoever. My dad had the Blondie Benedict, though, which was amazing. The rosemary hollandaise was truly delicious. My boyfriend got the chorizo flatbread, and was disappointed. My mother tried the gooey butter cake, which she'd never had before (my parents were visiting us in St. Louis, and it's one of the city's culinary staples), and was happy with what she got.\n\nThe coffee was fine, the service was fine, the ambiance was fine...overall, my experience was nothing special. If you find yourself in downtown STL and the more acclaimed breakfast/brunch restaurants are too busy, Blondie's is an okay alternative (and not expensive, which almost makes up for its menu's general lack of flavor).",

Fresh baked bread and ability to pick your own steak make this place unique and worth the trip. This is the place I take the kids when we want a steak. You cannot compare this to a del friscos, capital grill or Morton's, but among it's class it's tops. The kids don't like the burgers as they are made on the same sweet homemade bread they put on the table.

    "text": "Three stars, but that had a lot to do with service being good. As far as the food was concerned, I was pretty underwhelmed, if I'm being honest. Having rather recently dined at a different seafood boil establishment (The Shaking Crab in Norfolk VA), I had a pretty good comparison pretty fresh in my mind, and with that, The Boiling House under-delivered. \n\nCelebrating my mothers graduation, we decided to stop in and get a little messy on some seafood!.....or Vietnamese noodles. Apparently this place is both a seafood boil AND Asian noodle house. Ooook. After my mom threw the whole night into turmoil by ordering off the menu (which the staff WERE gracious enough to accommodate), we got on track and ordered. One vegan in our party went with just cajun fries. (Not many vegan options here, if thats a concern for you.) Another has an issue with seeing her food look like it looks before its food (why did we come here again?) so she went with some noodles, and my mother was playing fast and loose with the menu, so as far as the SEAFOOD BOIL goes, it was down to my sister and I to split a bucket. Snow crab legs, shrimp, potatoes, corn and a ciabatta roll; boiling house sauce, medium. \n\nFirst thing that was weird was that although everything has to be ordered by the pound, our crab legs had to be ordered in 1 1/4 pound increments. uh.....ok. Whatever. Second thing is that, the corn was mushy. Boiling corn must be a hard thing to do, as it was the same problem at the Shaking Crab. Third thing, and this is a big deal, were the shrimp. The shrimp were a good size, but they may as well have been made of pencil erasers. They were SOOOOOO chewy, and way more egregious than that, the shrimp weren't cleaned. Yuck. It took me 10 minutes before I could even start eating, because I had to clean every shrimp myself. \n\nThe rest of the food was OKAY. The crab legs were fine, the potatoes were fine, but nothing blew me away. The sauce was.....ok. Decent flavor, decent heat....a little watery....I was just like, \"meh,\" the whole meal. \n\nOur server was cool, and put up with a lot, (my mother is a handful) but he was polite throughout; asking the kitchen to make her special dish, and even pointing out to us that there is a military discount, so we got 10% off of the meal. \n\nThe place was nice inside and its BYOB with no corkage, so they definitely have that going for them. \n\nI can't say for sure either way if I'd be back or not. Again, I wasn't thrilled with the meal, but aside from the shrimp, I wasn't put off by anything either. I guess we'll see.\n\nOh, the floor is like the Icecapades. We all almost broke our necks walking in, and our waiters assistant slipped and knocked over a bucket of ice. Wear something with some grip.",

And if you are someone who loves over-the-top fries, even loading them up with cheese and meat, Village Whiskey is your place. If you are like me, and just want a simple cheeseburger with salted fries, Village Whiskey is NOT your place. \n\nNow, what I do really like about Village Whiskey is their pickles. They are the perfect combo of sharp, salty, and sweet. The pickles come with thick slices of bread, the most luxurious butter-like dairy product (It seems too good to be butter, yet it's obviously not margarine and is probably just really good butter), and tapenade. I especially love their beet pickles.\n\nI have also gone to Village Whiskey a few times for cocktails. While I believe they are typically full on weekend evenings, I have never had a problem finding a seat on a weeknight or after dining hours on a weekend. The cocktails are well-crafted.\n\nSo to sum it up, over-the-top burgers and fries (good or bad depending on your preference), fantastic pickles, and solid cocktails!",

It was pretty good, but unfortunately the rice is a undercooked. This was kind of a turn off for me because of the undercooked rice. Honestly, it will be a good arroz chaufa if it had used fully cooked rice. I suggested the bistec a la chorillana. The chorillana sauce was delicious. The steak was juicy (he'd asked for medium). The yuccas were crispy on the outside and not mashed. The arroz that came along with his meal was once again undercooked.\n\nThe sangria was pretty damn good as well. Can't go wrong with a glass of sangria in the hot weather of Florida. It was 6 dollars too. Cant go wrong with that.\n\nForgot to mention about the portion size. The portion size here is really big!

    "text": "Am in on a quick business trip in New Orleans and checked out this place - mainly because of its proximity to my hotel, but also in part because of the excellent reviews here on Yelp. I ordered a bowl of gumbo and a sazerac, both of which were good but not transcendent. The gumbo, at $10 a bowl, was fairly priced but not what I expected in terms of quality. Probably not the house specialty and probably not what I should have ordred, but c'est la vie. \n\nEverything seemed a little dusty, as well. Just didn't feel all that clean or comfortable.\n\nWould definitely come back, but with a bigger appetite and a wider focus on the menu.",

    "text": "TL;DR - cheap prices, best biscuit, no thrills\n\nUsually my breakfast spot in the area is Nicki's Omelette and Grill. Big fan of everything they do, but looking into breakfast on yelp, we saw the Ranch House pop up and figured we'd give it a shot. I had driven past it countless times, but as it closes after 2 pm, had never had a chance to go.\n\nAs described by others, the decor is out of the 70s. Wood walls, faded leather booths. Feels more like something from a small southern town then Tampa. Crowd was mostly families and elderly.\n\nThe menu is large - a lot of staples like different omelettes, pancakes, biscuits and gravy, waffles. Also a lot of named combinations that include all of the above. A lot of options, and at a cheap price.\n\nGirlfriend got a biscuit and gravy, with eggs and bacon. I went with the southern fried steak, biscuit, mashed potatoes and gravy and home fries. Mmm, carbs.\n\nThe food was ok. I definitely feel Nicki's food taste better (as well as having better coffee). But the price was hard to beat. You get your money's worth here. But if you're willing to spend a little more, head a bit east.\n\nAlso the biscuit was the best I've had in Tampa. Big and buttery, this would be worth coming for.",

    "text": "While staying at the Hotel Monaco for a wedding, we came to the Red Owl Tavern for drinks on both Friday and Saturday night, and brunch on Sunday. The place was packed all three times. It is definitely the after party spot for all the wedding guests staying in block rooms. Given the crowds and the bar otherwise being nothing special, I would avoid as a late night destination except for convenience if you're staying in the hotel. I also had some strange experiences with the servers and bartenders at night. They ran out of clean glasses   and we had to wait for our drinks. Not a problem, except when they finally brought them they did so without the water my friend requested. She asked again and they responded that there were no clean glasses...while making another alcoholic drink in one. They were clearly prioritizing the paid drinks but it was obvious and rude. They also said told us they couldn't communicate with the kitchen and serve food which also seemed odd. \n\nBrunch was decent. I had a chicken and waffles special that was nicely spiced. Reservations are highly recommended.",

    "text": "I really want to give Taj India a break because I really appreciate them for being there. Northeast Philly is desperate for decent Indian food, and Taj is definitely decent Indian food. Decent. Sometimes great, sometimes kind of lacking, but almost always decent. However as far as Indian food goes I've had much better for the same or similar price within 20-30 minute driving distance. \n\nI never eat in the place, it's a little depressing looking and often with weird music playing...but it's clean...I just prefer home in this case.\n\nOh, they also have a wide array of Indian desserts but I think they  might be too authentic for most Americans' taste...not sure...I'm not into trying random sweets but that's what I've heard.\n\nStuff I love about Taj: they make dosas! but also do a good job at north Indian dishes like Channa Masala, fairly cheap, call in your order and pick it up! The food reheats fairly well in a warm oven or a quick dump into a pot on the stove. Viola! Like new! Oh and its all vegetarian! \n\nStuff I don't love: I have to ask 5 times to get enough mint chutney, the sambhar is a little salty at times, some of the curries aren't that good (don't do the black dahl! go for channa masala. Also the naans are really good as are a lot of the appetizers, including the samosas. \n\nAll in all, it's a great find for the area, but it's sometimes hit or miss on some of the dishes. However the naan, samosas, and channa masala have been consistantly good.",

    "text": "Disclaimer: I was born in Vietnam, lived in Houston for 15 years, then moved to LA followed by Sacramento, all cities with a large Vietnamese population. So this was tough to rate; I'd say it's 3-star compared to all Vietnamese restaurants I've been to, but I'm new to Nashville and can't compare it to the other Vietnamese restaurants here yet.  \n\nThe spring rolls were decent; I agree with a prior review that they were a little smaller than usual but they were also cheaper (my advice - get one order per person if you're used to splitting an order of goi cuon at most Vietnamese places).  \n\nThe jellyfish salad (goi) was amazing - better than I've had at places elsewhere. Many places have way too much cabbage and very little of the other greens, like lotus root.  This salad had a little of everything and plenty of jellyfish as well as shrimp and pork (a nice bonus; many places don't add in the pork).  \n\nMy bun bo hue broth was too sweet.  Not my style, but I think some people like it that way.  Will update when I come back to try the pho.\n\nPrices were good - comparable to larger cities and very cheap compared to restaurants in general ($7 for bun bo hue; we spent $20 for dinner for two).  Service was awful.  The waiter (an employee) was friendly and attentive, but the woman I assume was the owner was openly rude to another customer and unfriendly to me when I paid at the counter.  I don't go to Vietnamese restaurants for the service, so this won't stop me from going back; just be aware that if she's rude, it's her, not you.",

I got my kid the ahi tuna tacos kids meal and the fish came out really bland. There's no cream sauce to go along with the tacos. The fries tasted like it was deep fried in really old frying oil. The New York strip steak that I ordered was tough. I ordered the steak medium and it came out more medium well. The fat was tough to cut off, most likely been sitting on the grill for too long. The monitor I ordered was okay, nothing to write home about. My wife had the spinach salad with steak. Her meat was tough as well. In all, the food is way too pricey for the quality food you get.",

    "text": "Stumbled across the Village Pub & Beer Garden on a busy Saturday night and decided the place looked hoppin' so why not give it a try? \n\nWalked into the busy bar and we were immediately greeted by a nice host who informed us that it was spot a seat, take a seat type seating. It brought a competitive edge to our dining experience. He also informed us that it was a smoking establishment outside on the patio. He was very nice explained to us some beers and offered to get us one while we waited for a table to open up. \n\nThe ambiance was a little too college bar for me. Very crowded, loud, and smoke filled. We patiently waited for a table that we were stalking to open up and swooped in when we saw our chance. They were either under staffed or overwhelmed with the crowd because flagging down a server was a difficult task. Our server seemed too busy to explain to us anything on the menu or any beer we might want to try. That and it was almost too loud for me to hear my friend sitting just inches in front of me (this was on the patio)\n\nWhen our food finally arrived it came out nice and hot. I had the bratwurst rueban and my partner in crime had the blackened chicken sandwich. All of their sandwiches come on pretzel bread (literally a pretzel cut in half as bread) which was a cool spin on a sandwich. They were both delicious and something different.  \n\nOverall the Pub was fine, nothing special, and no place to take a date. Way too loud. If you are looking to get a few drinks and maybe it would be better not on a Saturday night it seems like a good place to grab a sandwich and beer.",

Maybe it's personal preference, but I like my beets to be cooked/roasted and these were raw.  The mixed greens were fine and the dressing was very tasty.  Solid\nFatty B - While I've never really been a calzone girl, there were definitely some highlights--PROS: the pepperoni and meatball were tasty and abundant; there was an ton of onions; you could definitely taste the ricotta; the crust was very nice; it was a HUGE calzone....however, there were some CONS: there wasn't enough of the melty, cheesy factor here, maybe bc I ordered delivery and it got cold? or bc there wasn't enough cheese; the onions were a bit too raw.  I also got both the meat sauce and the spicy red sauce on the side....i like it saucy!  The meat sauce was veryyyy meaty, so really, feel free to skip this sauce with this calzone, meat on meat on ....meat.  The spicy red sauce had good tang and touch of heat, they were absolutely correct when they paired it with the Fatty B.\n\nOverall, I was very satisfied with this takeout meal.

Everyone I was with seemed to think that Ralph's was hooking it up and serving the best Italian food around, but.... meh. My mom and I make better lasagna.  The portions were big, and the food was good, but my mind was not blown and I probably wouldn't go back.  Maybe my lasagna just had me all nostalgic for mom's cooking, but I suspect that other people's dishes weren't as crazy good as they were saying.  We did arrive REALLY hungry",

    "text": "What a cool atmosphere , the place succeeds in being post modern and cozy at the same time.   I liked being there.  I did not have the hamburgers which looked good and popular.  This is about the doughnuts.  If you really love doughnuts you will probably be disappointed in these.  There is a weird texture to them that is quite breadlike, they reminded us of very plain kingcake.  \n\nThey are very oversized ,looking like small pillows.  The basics were the best.  The cinnamon doughnut and the pink sugar one were the best if you accept that this is really a doughnut.  The custard filled and chocolate glazed seemed good at first but soon you taste that subliminal chemical taste of industrial strength custard and chocolate icing. All this stuff seems from commercial mixes.  \n\nIt gets really scary when you get to the so called fancy doughnuts.  Chocolate mint has a weird brown filling that tastes like spearmint toothpaste.  The thyme flavored was completely unedible and the peanut butter and jelly had a cheap canned \"jelly\" surrounded by fake whipped cream atop a doughnut filled with a weird peanut like filling.  On of my friends observed that they should have just sliced a doughnut and used real peanut butter and jelly inside. If you are not a doughnut nut these might work for you.\n\nThe people working there were so nice, loved the place would go back  but as a doughnut lover ...i would never go back for  the doughnuts.",

    "text": "Bifurcated deliciousness. Yeah, go ahead look it up or check out El Camino Real to understand it first hand. \n\nECR features a menu pleasantly divided between inventive Mexican dishes and hearty down home fresh off the chuck wagon BBQ. Truth be told, I've never eaten from a chuck wagon, but I do know my BBQ and can call this authentically delicious from at least twenty paces. \n\nPricing seemed high on some items which I only realized when I was served a burrito less than the size of your average newborn. And while I loved the divided menu, I would have liked to see some fusion dishes that marry the two ideas together. \n\nWe hit up the happy hour for half price marg pitchers were tasty. Not sure if it was because of happy hour, there was a ton of ice in the pitcher delivered to our table. \n\nThe atmosphere like the food is lively and varied. ECR is a great place to grab some drinks with a small group of friends or meet up with co-workers for some happy hour fun. \n\nCouldn't give this place a 4/5 star review because in comparison with the Cantina, this place is just ok. Two things that stuck out were the ice to drink ratio and the fact they charge for chips and salsa. It's only a dollar for all you can eat, but still it seems cheap. Why charge at all? Or why charge for the first basket. Those two things combined made me wonder what else they are cheaping out on. \n\nTL;DR Great drinks; decent food. It's is worth a try especially if your palette can't decide between Mexican and BBQ.",

Forever grateful for that as there are only two big tables for two parties out back. We lucked out that night. Was happy they brought everyone's sushi out at same time. Waitress was very friendly and attentive though our group requested water few times from other staff and we only received it as we were paying bill. There was a big salmon bone in one of my rolls, which was scary, but overall I was very happy with my order. I tried my friends chirachi bowl and found some of the fish to taste less than fresh so I completely understood why he didn't finish it. Two rolls and a small beer was $40 before tip. Not a great feeling there, but when they are the only sushi game in town, what can you do?",

Chargrilled meat cooked perfectly, squeeze in between tomatoes lettuce and chargrilled bun... yum!

    "text": "This review pertains only to Saigon market, I will save the Restaurant for another review.\n\nThis is probably my least favorite Asian Market in town and probably Asian for that matter.  But they have two benefits that earn a visit from me every now and then.  \n\nEven though they have a very limited fresh meat selection but it is definitely the best out of all the Asian market.  You won't find rib eyes or filet mignon here, but more rustic cut such as pork belly, pork shoulder, beef shank, beef loin, and innards.  The second benefit is the one male worker, i think he's the butcher, stocking boy, and cleaner.  He's pretty fast when it comes to helping you with the meat.  If i needed him to cut the meat and bones a certain way, he'll be on it.  His English isn't very good but I think he can make out keyword and can help you find what you are looking for. \n\nTheir vegetable selection is limited and caters to Asian cooking.  Out of all the Asian market on Lafayette Road, Saigon has the worst vegetables!   They always look like they are dead or near dead.   The herbs in the refrigerated section is not too bad though and usually pretty fresh.  If you are wanting to buy vegetables though, I say skip Saigon and go to Saraga or Oriental market. \n\nSaigon has a similar selection of dried goods and frozen items like Van's Fish Market.   Check expiration dates especially on canned goods and I would be careful of frozen items as well.  I always make sure I do a thorough examination.  \n\nSaigon also sells freshly made bake goods and exotic fruits, and you can find them scatter up by the register.  The owner usually stands behind the register, she usually doesn't say anything to any of the shopper unless she knows them.  I wish she would be more cheery because it kinda ruins my shopping mood because I enjoy grocery shopping.  Overall, Saigon would be a MEH experience but the fresh meat selection earns this place another star.",

Beef and chicken were good though the beef was a little dry, the chicken the better of the two being tender and juicy. The shrimp in my opinion was the best.

It was slightly disappointing that we couldn't eat it but we all laughed about it and don't regret ordering the cookie!\n\n5 stars for presentation, customer service, and fast shipping!\n1 star for taste - chocolate was good but the cookie was as hard as a rock.\n\nI would probably think twice before ordering another giant fortune cookie though.",

If you're into that, please don't tell me, because I will judge you. \n\nWhat? I'm just being honest. \n\nThat said, Lucy's is not a bad place to have lunch if you work downtown, and I've done that on more than one occasion. As a sort-of vegetarian-ish, the only thing on the menu that I've ever ordered (and therefore I assume that it's the only thing on the menu that I CAN order, but don't quote me on this because I couldn't tell you for sure without actually seeing a menu again) is the quesedilla, which I am just now realizing I have no idea how to spell. Nor does Firefox spellcheck, evidently, because the options are \"questionable\" through \"Queensland\" and not the word I'm looking for. But I digress.\n\nThe one thing that I order but can't spell from Lucy's is pretty good, not overly expensive, and you can also go here for late-ish night drunk food in addition to lunch, which I've also done. \n\nBesides food and creepy middle aged men hitting on inappropriately younger girls who are apparently into that, the best thing about Lucy's is to sit outside with a bucket of beer during happy hour, and count how many cars blow the stop sign at that intersection. Lucy's is on the corner of Girod and Tchoupitoulas, and it's a four way stop. However, for some reason the vast majority of people do not seem to realize this. It's definitely entertaining, and would actually make for a good drinking game now that I think about it. \n\nLucy's: Go for lunch, a bucket of beer and after-work entertainment, or to reassure yourself that you've \"still got it\" by being hit on or hitting on insecure or aging, collar-popping strangers. Whatever the equivalent of collar-popping would be for a middle aged gentleman. A dandy? (Kidding. That'd be a flamboyantly gay man from the 19th century. Obviously.)",

However, once we did, It was easy to get outdoor seating, and the waitress nicely volunteered to get a high chair for our infant without us asking.  \n\nThe coffee was about average for a decent restaurant - not bad, but nothing special.  I ordered the salmon omelet and my wife ordered eggs, pancakes and sausage.  The salmon omelet was flavorful and the Old Bay sour cream was a nice touch that worked well.  My wife found her meal totally unremarkable - not bad, but nothing we couldn't have done at least as well at home.  The prices were pretty reasonable for a sit down restaurant on the Main Line ($9.50 for the salmon omelet).  \n\nThe service was pleasant enough, but a touch erratic - it was quite a while before I was offered a coffee refill, for example.  After we got the bill, we found that my wife had been charged incorrectly for her order, and when she asked to get it corrected, was briefly lectured on the confusing way in which she'd ordered before they agreed to change the bill.  \n\nOverall, our experience wasn't bad - the high points were the salmon omelet and the outdoor seating on a beautiful day - but we'd be more inclined to keep looking for a really good brunch near Wynnewood than  to make a return visit.",

We figured it was worth a quick drop in, since MetroCenter is devoid of food options.\n\nThe good... Super low prices. We weren't sure if it was by accident, by promotion, or what, but we both ate (with drinks) for around five bucks. Service was quick and friendly. Food was price-appropriate. Fries were excellent. Varied menu with pizza, burgers, calzones, etc... Ordinarily I'm not a fan of the shotgun restaurant approach, but in MetroCenter it almost makes sense.\n\nThe marginal... You self-serve your pizza from a heating unit. The pizza was clearly pre-made crust cardboard stock frozen pie. Bland, gooey cheese. Mixed buffet and menu like all other entities that have tried to co-exist with Neely's over the years...it didn't work for them, why keep trying? Extra unused buffet steam tray counter crammed into front of restaurant takes up space and raises cleaniness questions. Decor MetroCenter chic. \n\nWill I eat here again? Probably. Would I recommend it to a friend? Probably not. \n\nPS - Delivery with a minimum order of $10.",

    "text": "I'm very torn about how to rate this place. I think we had a one off experience and it might have had something to do with it being during Devour Downtown. But, we met some friends here. Initially we sat upstairs outside in the lounge seating.  Our server was Justin and he was incredible. We ordered some appetizers of the empanadas and Brussels sprouts. Both very tasty. Our drinks were wonderful as well. We decided to grab a table and have dinner and Justin was able to remain our server which we were happy about. This was at about 6:30. We ordered our food around 7'ish. Two of us ordered from the Devour menu and two did not. I saw our server ring our food in. We didn't get our appetizers (included as part of Devour) until almost 8pm. We noticed not a lot of food was coming out- so assumed maybe there was an issue in the kitchen. Then as we were waiting for our entrees we noticed many tables who were sat after us getting their food. We were getting a little frustrated and quite frankly pretty hungry at this point. Our food finally arrived around 8:45!!!!! By the time we got it, it was too dark to even see my food. It tasted pretty good, but the look of the food is a big part of what appeals to my appetite. Dessert came with the Devour menu and we ordered the churros. So, all in all we left pretty disappointed, but I will try it again. They were good and took our entrees off our bill. Am I wrong for rating this as 3 stars? I think I have to because I feel like I missed out on really experiencing the food.",

This disturbing trend by some new restaurants: \"We really don't give a **** if we inconvenience YOU, we just don't want to mess with reservations..\" is particularly an issue at The Livery, as even at 5:30 the bar was already pretty much full.  So you can try to squeeze in around the bar, where the servers are looking annoyed because you're in their way (you are), or you can sit on a bench in the foyer not knowing if you'll get a table in 30 minutes or 4 hours.  Totally unacceptable in my book.\n\nNow the good:   The food is awesome!  As is typical of the Cunningham group restaurants, the menu is well thought out with Latin American themed small plates and entrees.  We tried quite a few and they were all tasty with an interesting amalgamation of flavors and seasonings.  Service was good, with the servers well trained on the menu options.\n\nSo overall, a good experience, especially since we didn't have to wait too long, but I wouldn't try it on a weekend after 6 pm or so, unless your time is so unworthy that you want to sit around indefinitely for a table.",

I could have done something better myself for cheaper. Though I myself did not try the bowls, there was very little smoothie at the bottom (for the 8 oz) and they were very liquidy.  I would opt for the 16 oz, even though $10.99 for an acai bowl is pretty steep.  Ultimately it wasn't bad, but I probably would not come here again.",

    "text": "This is the Bellevue/West Nashville edition of M.L. Rose.  It's pretty comparable to the original spot.  Here is my review of that one:\n\n\nM.L. Rose isn't bad, but it's not great.  I love the concept.  They are a burger place that offers an above average beer selection.  That's a great start!\n\nThe problem is their execution.  The beer list is good.  It could probably be a bit better since 'craft beer' is actually in their name.  However, I have no complaints with their above average selection.  However, the food is very average.  They could do a better job and I would lump their burgers into this group.  Unfortunately, I would have to say that this is you classic example of bar food.\n\nI do come here occasionally and always enjoy myself.  It's a fun atmosphere and the service is good and very friendly.  They also sponsor Nashville Sports Leagues and I love the folks that give back to their community.  I've been there several times just because of that relationship.\n\nM.L. Rose is a decent bar overall and a good place to grab a burger and a beer.  It's just not one of the better places in Nashville to get these items.",

If you're going to eat there with someone you want to speak to, definitely eat in the bar area or outside. The food was just OK and not impressive. For example, if I was going to Denny's and I ordered the pasta with Morreale mushrooms and and an order of sea scallops. It would've been the best meal I ever had at Denny's. Unfortunately, I was paying $70 for food that did not impress me. Both dishes were just OK. I would tell everyone it's worth eating at one time but not the second. For celebrating our wedding anniversary, it was a disappointment.",

My husband ordered a calzone (he requested it without sauce inside). I was disappointed with the pizza. It wasn't bad, it just didn't have a lot of flavor. To be fair, they are a Chicago-style joint and it wasn't a Chicago-style pizza, so it might not have been their best. But I don't like Chicago-style pizza so I'm not sure I'll try again. The calzone was the best calzone I've tasted in a long time. I wish I hadn't ordered anything because it was huge! And it came with a side of spaghetti, although that wasn't impressive either. The service was great though. I'd be willing to come back to try other things on the menu.",

    "text": "I've been wanting to come here for quite sometime and I finally dragged the boyfriend here for dinner tonight. Upon entering, i noticed the decor was quite modern and clean in appearance, but felt very crowded as they were trying to fit too many tables into a small space. I looked up the menu online before hand to get an idea of what they offer. They had a variety of options including all you can eat sushi and hibachi (17.95 for adults) or you can order a la carte for various maki and signature rolls as well as hibachi, apps, teriyaki, etc. However, when we were seated they only gave us the all you can eat menu. I chose to walk out as I knew I could not eat enough to make it worth the money on this particular evening. That's when they informed me that they had an a la carte menu. I wish they had presented it up front upon seating us, seemed like they want people to just order from the unlimited menu, so they hide the ala carte menu behind the hostess stand. \n\nRegardless, we decided to stay and give it a shot. The prices were very reasonable for the a la carte ($3-4 for plain and simple rolls, $8-10 for signature), but it was reflected in the quality and presentation of the food to a certain extent. We chose the Mexican, California, spicy tuna and rock 'n roll. All were good in my opinion except the spicy tuna which was the most boring roll of my life (even more yawn worthy than California). Normally a spicy tuna has some extra toppings or pizzazz on top, but this was totally plain. Meh. It was also a bit mushy. Not good for someone like myself who enjoys crunchy and crispy sushi. Besides that all other rolls were decent. The BF doesn't eat sushi often, but can appreciate it once in a while. He thought this sushi was 3/10, based on the thick double layer of rice on each roll as well as simplicity of some of the rolls. In my opinion it was more like a 6/10, hence my \"A-OK\" 3 star review.\n\nOverall, the concept is good for those who can eat, eat and eat some more. However for those with a smaller appetite it would be better to order a la carte if you can't eat at least 3 rolls. I will likely give it another chance in the future, perhaps to try their 3 rolls lunch combo for $9.99 or maybe to try some of the hibachi.",

Depending on the food (lo mein) i might feel totally gross until the next day, like i ate a boatload of msg eventhough they say they use only vegetable oil. But other foods (fries and miso soup) are perfect cheap lunch go tos. Their miso soup gets an A+. The broth is delicious and theres an almost absurd amount of tofu and seaweed. Perfection.

    "text": "So my husband and I were both in the mood for some steak after some light shopping inside the mall. So here is my experience...\nEntering the steakhouse is as is if you're entering a secret club, not a lot of decor but just enough. We were greeted by Christopher who proceeded to seat us. Our waitress came by shortly after and took our beverage order which consisted of Pellegrino, a Morton's Champagne Cocktail, and a Gin & Tonic. Nothing amazing or out of the ordinary. We ordered a wedge salad with thousand island dressing and a caeser salad and a large round of bread that was topped.with onions was brought out to us. So far so good. \nEntrees........Center Cut Ribeyes, creamed spinach and sauteed Brussels sprouts. Now for being a steakhouse I personally don't feel that the steak was up to par. In my opinion the steak was pretty generic and nothing too memorable, creamed spinach was good but the Brussels sprouts were lackluster. Not enough seasoning on them and there was a textural inconsistency that my husband and I continue to argue about since the sprouts he bit into were overcooked while I had overcooked and perfectly cooked. The plating was generic as well. Your basic run of the mill off white oval plate for the steak and a twig of what I believe to be an herb of some sort but don't quote me on it because I can't be too sure. The desert was the hot chocolate cake which is basically a lava cake along with coffee. The cake was quite good, the center was molten and the outside had a good crust to it...a crust I kind of wish would have been on my steak as well. \nOur waitress was great, very friendly, helpful, and attentive. I have no complaints about the service what so ever my issue was with the steak and Brussels sprouts. Flavorless and inconsistent. Not sure if my husband or I would return to this location but we are willing to give Morton's another shot, maybe they were just having an off day or maybe this location needs some improvement. Either way for the amount of money spent I personally believe they need to step it up.",

The portions are very large, the calamari was enough for 2 or maybe 3.\nIt came out hot, not greasy or chewy. The salads are also large, but the dressing was a bit much for my taste.\nThe pasta was cooked al dente, and the veal was tender. Sauces for both dishes were spicy and plentiful.\nThat being said, there are a couple drawbacks to this place. IF the weather permits, you are much better sitting outside, since its crowded and quite loud inside. While the food is above an average Italian restaurant, it seemed like they lay on the cheese and sauces a bit heavy.\nYes, it's nice they give you a Lemoncello shot after dinner, and the service was friendly, even though they were crowded. I would say the pasta at Avalon a few blocks away is superior, but overall Lemoncello is good and especially for families.",

    "text": "Went to Bailey's on a suggestion from my son after a Cards game. There were six of us so we were able to taste quite a few things.\n\nFor appetizers we tried the Fried Pickles and Smoked Jalape\u00f1o Chicken Wings. Our party enjoyed both appetizers. The pickles were perfect with a delightful batter. If you are a fan of jalape\u00f1os please order the chicken wings...the jalape\u00f1o flavor is very prevalent.\n\nAs far as the burgers are concerned we ordered Dave's Chop House, \nthe Gyro, Carolina Bison, and the Buffalo. \n\nThe Gyro was our least favorite mainly because it didn't taste like a Gyro. The lamb meat was very bland and the cucumber sauce was nonexistent. \n\nThe Buffalo was juicy and flavorful; it tasted as expected.\n\nDave's burger was just ok. We were looking to taste more bacon but the rosemary was overwhelming. I ended up taking the meat and just eating it without the bread and toppings.\n\nThe Carolina Bison was the overall favorite! Just Delicious.\n\nWe gave three stars because all of the meat was fantastic...fresh and awesome but we were disappointed in just a few things which took the score down. \n\n1. It was overly warm in the restaurant; as though the air wasn't on and no ice was offered for our waters.  After a baseball game and walking to the restaurant it would've been nice to walk into a cool place.\n\n2. We all had ice cream and felt it was subpar; mainly because it was melting so fast. I ordered the Sweet Sweet Bacon Shake and was disappointed when it arrived with NO BACON & no explanation. 10 minutes after the shake arrived I was told they were out of the bacon...my whole reason for ordering the shake. The shake had a great flavor but I'm sure it would've been more awesome with the bacon.\n\n3.  The fries were below standard. When you pay 12+ dollars for a burger you expect great fries to accompany that burger. The many dipping sauces were fine but these fries were obviously frozen not terrible but frozen. Fresh cut fries to go with the extremely fresh burger would've been better.",

I was expecting a larger group and some people were running late/canceled last minute and we were sitting outside. Our waiter, who was maybe 45, took FOREVER to even take our order. I asked him what was in the \"meat\" ravioli and he said, \"Uh... meat.\" Yeah no shit. Food took forever, service was poor, food was mediocre. I usually like Caruso's but it just kinda sucked the last time I was there.",

Based on another review that raved about them, I decided to try.  They came out golden and crispy on the exterior.  I broke one open and the smell of MOLD hit me in the face.  I tasted one to make sure my assumption was correct.  I told the waitress and she gave me the excuse that, \"that is the way they are supposed to smell and taste b/c the ricotta chz they use is not American.\"  WTF?  The waitress took the barely touched app away.  I get the bill and they are still on the check.  I called her over to ask to have them removed and she says,\"The owner says you ate them\".  Now I'm a straight up person...if I ate em, I will pay for it.  She delivers the newly edited check back to me with an attitude.  THAT will affect your tip, chica!!\nOn the plus side, the CHULETA NORTENA (pork chop) was juicy and flavorful.  Accompanied by the slightly sweet and creamy sweet potato.  The chipotle-tamarind sauce gave the thick cut chop a sweet and slightly spicy accent.  A must have.",

Take and bake pizza are a genius idea and normally I have five star service. However, I visited this location tonight to pick up my order and was left waiting at the pick up window for over six minutes. Meanwhile, I watched the staff, on their cell phones, genuinely ignore me at the window. I tried to get their attention but clearly they were preoccupied. I then parked my car to head inside and saw one of the workers clearly FaceTiming someone while the other worker hurried to look busy as I walked in. My pick up order was fast but I simply could not believe I was ignored at the pickup window. It's simply distasteful customer service and a reason to visit another location.",

Their Pho is a bit salty and has more taste than Miss Saigon (its better).  But I would say that just about everything else on the menu, though cheaper, is not as good as it is at Miss Saigon.  Their rice paper rolls and bubble tea (powder based) were huge disappointments.  The rolls' pork tasted off and you have to make a special request for the peanut sauce. And my vermicelli dish was just mediocre.\n\nIt drives me crazy that they don't take credit cards because I never carry cash on me and its a pain in the butt to have to make a special trip to the next door atm at Kroger's.\n\nThe staff are not very friendly (except for this one guy) and definitely not attentive.  It took them 5 minutes to get a menu to us, another 5-7 minutes to take our order, another 15 minutes to get our drinks and another 10 minutes to bring out the orders.  SO SLOW!!!  And it took the guy forever to come back with the peanut sauce which I asked for for the rolls and for a fork and they were so absent minded that when we went to pay for the bill, she took the money then started cleaning tables before she gave us back our change!\n\nIts not fancy or anything, but the food is authentic, delicious and cheap.  Sometimes I wonder how clean the kitchen or backrooms are, but whatever...\n\nBottom line: food is mediocre/ pretty good but cheap, service is slow, staff is inattentive. Its too packed and noisy, which I think is the reason for the slow and inattentive service.  Attracts a lot of local Vietnamese and poor college students, but  for an extra 2 bucks, I'd rather go to Miss Saigon and have a close to perfect experience.",

    "text": "I really do like this Shop Rite.  The prices and hours are great, and the service is generally decent.  The deli has usually has a special, which is a nice surprise everytime (like turkey for $3.99/lb!), and I always get samples of meats and cheeses to snack on while I wait for my order.  The bakery is usually well-stocked although the donut selection is not as fantastic as Giant's; they do have the essentials, though.  The store itself isn't the most well-organized but it has everything at relatively low prices.  Plus, if you shop on a Sunday morning, they have complimentary coffee, danishes, bagels, and cookies, which is a really nice gesture, I think.  I've also noticed that service has gotten a lot better over the years.  They also have an entire aisle dedicated to Mexican groceries, too, which most other surrounding groceries stores don't have.",

    "text": "Visited here for the first time after reading the reviews.  The food was very good; however, the service was lacking and most of the tables were complaining about the length of time it took to get their food.  The table next to us waited about 1/2 hour just to get a server to take their order. I had that Spaghetti Carbonara, which was delicious.  My wife ordered Eggplant Parm, which she said was really tasty. Our water and bread was never refilled. The waiter seemed more concerned about the customers on the outdoor patio.  The thing that annoyed me most was when I asked for change from the bill, it took forever to bring the change.  I asked another server if we could get the change and she responded with \"change is really hard to find around here.\"  And then they gave me change but not the correct amount.  Guess they didn't want to give coins back but every establishment I've ever visited gives you the full change. I am a very good tipper (20-25%) as my former career was in a gratuity based industry but nothing annoys me more than when a waiter doesn't want to give you change because they feel it should all be theirs for a tip.",

It is located adjacent to a sketchy looking Budget Inn that could easily be the set for the Bates Motel. The restaurant itself is very much a mom and pop gig with limited frills. However, the food is actually quite decent with a varied menu that includes chile rellenos, fajitas, chalupas, tacos, enchiladas and more. The chips come out hot the second you sit down and the salsa is fresh and there is an endless supply. \n\nThe service is quick, friendly and efficient. Again with no frills--which I am ok with when I want to eat and get back to work. \n\nIt is a great place to grab a quick bite. You will leave feeling satisfied.

Most of the items I have had from them have been really good, with few exceptions (don't get the eggplant).  They have a nice crust and you can tell that they use quality cheese.  Then why 3 stars? ...\n\nWe usually order delivery, and they have gotten our order wrong more times than right (and not just pizza toppings, we are talking meal orders, missing items paid for, etc).  They do their best to make up for it, but it takes the whole convenience and enjoyment out of delivery night.  I don't mean to beat this dead horse, but I already mentioned the limp crust, so don't forget to order it well done.  One time we called to order for delivery and asked if the mushrooms were fresh or canned/jar, and the person on the phone assured me that they only use fresh mushrooms.  That was a lie, as I can assure you that the mushrooms that were on our pizza were definitely soggy canned 'shrooms.  I understand that is just a personal preference that will not affect everyone.  However, the employee should have checked with the kitchen before giving me the wrong info.  (All of the other toppings I have had have been awesome.)  Lastly; I would say they are slightly overpriced.  That is the general consensus when my friends mention Frank's.  I don't mind paying for quality food, but I would like it to show up at my door correctly.  (Side note: their delivery drivers are very courteous and apologetic.)\n\nUnfortunately, this place is hit and miss, but when they do get it right, it's my favorite delivery pizza pie in Dunedin.",

Were told there would be a 30 minue wait - sure, no problem.  Found seats at the bar, got a drink, and ... waited for an hour and a half!  But it was too cold venture outside needlessly, so we waited and were finally seated in the upstairs dining area, which we were initially happy about because it seemed quieter than downstairs and there were only 3 other parties up there.  Until they TURNED UP THE MUSIC so loud we l.i.t.e.r.a.l.l.y. could not hear each other.  Or the waiter.  We politely asked him to turn the music down and after giving us a sourpuss look he turned down the music just a smidge, like a surly teen who can't believe his parents are asking him to turn down his oh-so-rockin' tunes.\n\nOther than that, the food was great (though no fish & chips on the menu -- wah!) and the service was also very good (I think the waiter realized he had been a bit of a jerk and tried to make it up to us).\n\nIn general, this seems more like a local, young, slightly hipster hang out bar than somewhere you would make a special trip to visit, so if you're local and in your twenties, I say go for it.",

(Not ideal when this is a stop for lunch and you have plans to sightsee afterwards)\n\nPerhaps for brunch/breakfast their food is better but I'm not impressed.

But sadly, there are better places to get donuts (Suzy Jo's in Blue Bell) and Korean chicken (Cafe Soho).  The chicken wings were moist, but insanely salty...  and I love my food salty, so for me to notice it is saying something.  I ordered half plain and half chili, and the chili sauce made the wings really slimy and they completely lost their crunch (good Korean style fried chicken can still stay crunchy under the sauce).\n\nTheir hot donuts are pretty darn tasty, I'd choose them over the specialty ones.  If I were to pick one donut of theirs that was stellar, it would be the strawberry lavender (had it at their Rittenhouse location).  Hot out of the fryer and bursting with flavor, it was a nice snack.  I'd have that again.\n\nThe only reason I'm not giving them 2 stars is because the staff are super nice.  That's worth an extra star for me.\n\nAlso -- be aware that this isn't a sit-down restaurant.  There are 3 stools at the counter and that's it, so plan on taking your chicken to go.",

So you pick your own cheese, then the staff just unwraps it, puts it on a try and serves it with some really thick slices of bread and a few small accouterments.  For the price of the cheese plate, I expect the cheese to be sliced, presented in a better way and that  bread needs to go!  It is way to thick and the pieces are way too big. The bread ends up being the highlight of the cheese tray. It would be better if you can bring your own cheese and then Bacchanal can provide other bread and items for purchase instead. The wine selection is okay but the cheapest is $25 and for that quality, I expect more, but they are making a killing of up-charging these bottles of wine. Not sure if I would go back, seems there are better options for cheese and wine elsewhere in Nola.",

    "text": "My beau and I stopped here after a movie in Cool Springs. On a Saturday night, pretty much every restaurant in the area is packed. At this place, the wait was 75-90 minutes. Since we'd already tried a couple other places near the theatre, we shrugged our shoulders and decided to wait. Luckily for us, we found a two-top in the bar area and were able to sit about 10 minutes after walking in. In hindsight, I'm glad we got that spot cause if we'd waited 1.5 hours for a table, we would have been disappointed. \n\nThe service was good. Our waitress was very attentive and friendly. We ordered pretzel bread with cheese for an appetizer. My husband got shrimp tacos and I ordered the Asian chicken salad. For drinks, I had the lager and beau had a Black and Tan. The beer was okay. We've been to several brewery/restaurants and these weren't the best beers. In terms of the food, our mains came out before the app, but when I reminded the waitress, the pretzels came out quickly. Beau said his tacos were pretty good. My chicken salad was decent, but I didn't realize that the salad had a creamy dressing AND a soy-sauce based glaze. It felt like I was eating a giant bowl of cole slaw with soy dressing and fried wontons on top. The pretzels were pretty good, but the cheese sauce left something to be desired. I'm a pretzel connoisseur, so I don't take this lightly ::wink wink::. I prefer cheese sauces that have some beer flavor in them. This sauce was pretty tasteless and just had some salsa veggies on top. \n\nWould we go back? Yeah, maybe. For that price range and atmosphere, we would probably go to J. Alexander's or Brick Top's. If we came back, it would be for the service, and to try some different dishes. And I'd get a Cosmo instead if beer.",

They have decent tacos and have the great authentic Mexican spicy green sauce that burns so hot and tingly.  They do have some sandwiches and other assorted items not found in the typical NOLA Mexican place.  The area where this restaurant shines is in its selection of soups.  They have a large selection of many types of soups and stews that you just won't easily find anywhere else in the area.  The caldo de pollo (they recently have cut back on making this) and caldo de camarones are two of my favorites here but they also offer lots of other meats and different combinations.

    "text": "I like food trucks. \n\nI like food trucks that have Poutine. \n\nI may just be a little biased here, but ALAS, I have found poutine in New Orleans.   For those of you who don't know what poutine is, it's actually a canadian dish originating in quebec.  It is composed of fries, with cheese curds that are sprinkled on top and they melt into a gooey mess as brown gravy is poured onto it.  It's a heart attack in a cup.\n\nBack home in Canada, they have a a lot of different variations of poutines, and there are specialty poutine shops. I often think about poutine, so I was especially excited when I saw it on Foodie Call's menu as they were setting up.  I was so excited, I couldn't wait and I ordered it immediately, I had to wait about 20 minutes for the poutine because they hadn't even started up their burners yet.\n\nAlthough it didn't taste like home, the poutine was still good in its own New Orleans way.  A little bit of seasoned fries, gravy with debris, and cheese curds.  Cheese curds weren't quite melted into a gooey mess, they were still sort of square and not totally soft.\n\nPlus side, I know where I can poutine for my cravings, I just have to chase this truck down, and now I also know where I can get cheese curds in this city.  As we all know the grocery stores don't carry them.",

We love their pretzel appetizers, caesar, greek, and pepperoni pizza.  And the beer selection is always great.  But for some reason, the Brandon location has struggled on service.  The waitress we had was \"out there\".  We had to constantly remind her of drink refills.  And then we sat and watched our pizzas sit on the shelf for 10 minutes after coming out of the oven...while she ran the take-out register and chatted up the bartender.  The food was just as good as other locations...but the service...c'mon...customers visiting a pizza shop don't have high expectations to begin with.  I've had wet sponges with more personality.  They've got the food quality and kitchen staff...get rid of the service problems and this Mellow Mushroom will be the best in the pizza business for the Tampa area.",

    "text": "I went in as a fan of Chicago-style pizza, which 312 advertises itself as specializing in.  Maybe I'm not fully versed in the details of Chicago-style, but I was slightly disappointed in a few details.  First, however, the ambiance and service were great.  I arrived about 6pm on a Tuesday and found a place to park right on the street outside.  My waitress was charming and attentive, so no problems there.  I ordered a deep-dish 10\" cheese & pepperoni, expecting to eat half there and take the other half home.  My waitress warned me they take a while to cook - app. 45 minutes.  Which it did. Good thing I wasn't starving.  When the pizza came, there was plenty, but the sauce...oh, the sauce!  Tomato sauce dripping from every conceivable spot on the pizza, overwhelming the taste of the cheese and even the pepperoni.  And the crust was surprisingly hard, as if overdone.  But it was definitely thick with cheese and definitely filling.  I still have yet to eat my leftovers so my opinion may change slightly, but I doubt I'll be coming back.\n\nOh, and the price - $20 for a 10\" one-topping pizza.  I bit the bullet because it sounded so good, but my total bill was almost $30 and definitely not worth what I got.\n\nUPDATE: Apologies for getting a couple of factual items incorrect.  I went back and re-looked at the online menu to get my facts straight.  It was indeed a 12\" pizza, and the price was $17.  With an iced tea, tax, and tip my total bill came to right about $30.  Probably not out of line, but less than satisfied with final product as indicated above. I apologize for any mischaracterization of the value.",

    "text": "We went to Farmhaus last weekend for probably the 10th-15th time.  As always, the food was amazing.  The mushroom salad was very tasty and the breakfast was as wonderful as always.  It is definitely one of my favorite meals there-or anywhere.  \n\nIn the past, I would have given Farmhaus five stars and moved on.  \n\nHowever, after we sat, we were informed of the chef's tasting menu-a new addition since the last time we had been there.  All was good and the menu looked great.  Out of our party of four, we definitely had 1-2 people interested in this tasting menu, particularly because their morel mushroom pasts could only be ordered off this menu, not the regular menu.  \nThe problem is that Farmhaus insists that each person at the table order a tasting menu if one person does.  Well, not everyone wanted a tasting menu!  We had a person with us recovering from the flu and he inquired whether he could split a tasting menu as he had little appetite and just wanted a bite of food.  Nope, each person had to order their own.  So we had 2 people who wanted the tasting menu (at over 50 dollars) and two who did not.  Any flexibility?  No.  We even thought about splitting the table up and having the two who wanted the tasting menu go sit by themselves so they could order what they wanted.  I'm not sure that is something we should have had to consider.  \nWe finally ordered entrees and moved on but were still very disappointed in the way this was handled and the inflexibility of the menu.  After this, plus a bill that seemed higher than usual (Did they raise their prices recently?) we have decided not to return.  \n\nI do want to say our server was amazing.  She was very nice and did apologize for the inflexibility of the menu nicely-but there was nothing she could do about it.  \n\nI am disappointed as this was one of our favorite restaurants, but again-I do not think we will be returning after this.",

Started out with the onion rings, which I thought would be a smaller portion, but they were huge, and really really good.  I'd go back for those alone.  I had a few, boxed the rest, and ordered the Meatloaf Sandwich from the House Specialties portion of the menu.\n\nWhat came out was the most confusing quasi-sandwich I've ever encountered.  A rather large piece of meatloaf which had been griddled (and slightly burned) placed on top of a one long piece of texas toast, served with a side of brown gravy, apple slices (?) and cole slaw.  One piece of bread, not two, clearly going for the 'open faced' sandwich riff here, and lettuce, tomato and red onion were placed alongside.  I sat there for a few minutes wondering exactly what to do with this sandwich.  Do I cut it in half and slap it together, no way, too big for that.  This confusion would have been acceptable had the sandwich tasted, well, like anything.  The meatloaf was devoid of any flavor, and so was the brown gravy.  Two key components of this sandwich, completely flavorless.  The bread was ok, but at that point, rather insignificant.  I attempted to put the tomato and onions on top for a flavor infusion, but somehow, that made things taste worse.  Pretty disappointing.  The apple slices served alongside were so soggy they bent when you picked them up.  The coleslaw was ok, but not really my cup of tea.\n\nI have no doubt that Chatham Tap has some solid food on their menu, the onion rings bear that out, but avoid the meatloaf sandwich. Three stars for the onion rings, 0 for the rest.",

I loved going to trivia and karaoke night. Seriously awesome!\n\nHowever..\n\nI've seen quite a few reviews talking about the staff here. I rarely had a friendly server and good luck trying to talk to the manager. I once ordered a cocktail and it tasted like it had been mixed with water. I asked to speak to the manager and I saw him roll his eyes when my waiter told him I had issue with my drink. When he came over I asked why he had rolled his eyes and this set him off. He accused me of being drunk and threatened to call the cops. Considering I had driven from work to there completely sober, I was offended and told him I didn't appreciate his tone considering how often I gave his place business. Apparently they have some type of alcohol measuring system (his words, not mine) that pours the exact amount of booze into all their cocktails (???). Whatever, he offered to give me a drink for free (cool) and all was forgiven.\n\nI moved away, and I miss this place, but that one time kind of put a bad taste in my mouth (no pun intended). I'd recommend the cheeseburger pizza, btw, with a nice glass of chimay.",

    "text": "Best word to describe is \"meh\"... The hotel recommended Walter's when I asked where I could get a good steak and a spicy Bloody Mary.  They said it was one of the best steak places in Wilmington.  It was on the level of Outback at best and that isn't really a good thing.  Maybe my expectations were set too high. The drink was good.  The mix was spicy and they added a good amount of alcohol.  So my meal started on the right foot.  The meatball appetizer was good; just a little over cooked, kinda burnt on the outside.  My steak was tender so a good grade of meat but the flavor was just blah.  I almost asked for steak sauce. That kind of blah. I ordered a side of asparagus because I love asparagus! However, it was severely overcooked and limp.  It looked overcooked so it should have NEVER made it to me! It was as if they boiled some frozen asparagus.  For the price, I expect more.  It wasn't some cheap spot. I ate the steak and left what used to be a vegetable.  All in all...would I go back? No. Would I recommend it? No. I have been to other places nearby with much better results. But if it is raining cats and dogs outside, you had a long day, and you just want a meal and a drink to relax then this is ok.",

    "text": "Overall this wasn't a bad experience.  We were greeted promptly and sat promptly...however, we were sat at a table that hardly fit our food (and there was only 2 of us).  The main courses were brought out right after our appetizer (more to come on that) and did not leave any room on the table for all of the food.  \n\nThe appetizer was \"highly praised\" by our server Michael who, by the way, is an excellent salesman.  He claimed it was the best Queso dip that he's ever had and it's not \"runny\" by any means.  Well, it wasn't runny...it was like one greasy block of cheese all stuck together in the dish...you pretty much had to cut it into pieces and place it on the chip or in the tortilla that they give.  \n\nThe main dishes were good.  I had the chicken street tacos...they seemed pretty authentic, and there was plenty of food.  My wife had the chicken quesadilla, which seemed a bit greasy but she ate most of it.  \n\nThis place was nice to try, but I probably wouldn't go back... just didn't seem like our thing.",

    "text": "Timpano's has been on my list of places to visit for quite some time now, based on recommendations from other yelpers as well as a friend of mine who works there as a bartender. Mind you, this place is a bit fancier than where I would normally go, but last night was a special occasion (anniversary dinner for the man and I) so we made reservations for 2 and decided to venture out for a swanky evening.\n\nWhen we arrived, the host was friendly, efficient and brought us to our table right away. The server promptly greeted us after, but we needed a few moments to browse the wine list so we asked him to return shortly. When he came back, we ordered a glass of commodore wine and a malbec red wine as well as the tuna poke appetizer. As we settled in, I noticed the environment in the restaurant had a great feel to it. The live jazz band that was playing added a nice touch, that was one of the reasons we chose this place to begin with.\n\nThe app and wine were delivered to us quickly. We both enjoyed our wine and the appetizer was tasty as well. I'm not one to eat raw tuna often, but it was well seasoned and had a good consistency, so that was a winner. Next we split the watercress & arugula salad, which was brought out to us on 2 small plates (Bonus points when a restaurant does that without me having to ask them to split it). That was really tasty as well, had a great mix of flavors.\n\nFor our entrees, he chose the chicken marsala and I ordered the sea scallops with polenta and asparagus. The server gave him a choice of spaghetti or a vegetable side with the marsala and he went for the spaghetti. When our meals came out, I was a bit surprised to see that my meal only came with 3 small scallops on a scoop of polenta and some overcooked asparagus. I'm not normally one to eat all of my meal when I go out, I almost always have leftovers, but this was such a small portion I ate it all up even with the apps and salad that we had first. Mind you, the scallops were very tasty, but for $25 I would expect a bigger portion. Sadly, he said his chicken marsala was a poor quality; it had no taste, the spaghetti was a big gloppy hunk of noodles and to top it off they even charged extra for the spaghetti. Who charges extra for noodles at an italian restaurant when they are traditionally included with the dish anyway?\n\nAs a final touch, the server knew we were celebrating a special occasion, so they brought us out a slice of tiramisu to share, which was indeed delicious. Some of the best tiramisu I've ever had. This helped to redeem the poor chicken marsala experience a bit. \n\nOverall, the service was good, the food was tasty for the most part and the ambience was upscale yet relaxing, so those were all good points. Based on the few negative points with the small portion size of my meal and the poor quality of his, we have arrived a total score of 3 stars for Timpano's. I've heard great things about their weekend brunch and mimosas, so may consider returning for that sometime.",

    "text": "You know, Superior Grill is one of those places I have a love hate relationship with. While I love going there with friends to get together for whatever celebratory reason we can make up and have some delicious margaritas, I really don't enjoy the food that much. The food is really just not that good. Considering the great Mexican options we have now in the city since the Big \"K,\" I think that Superior Grill needs to make some recipe changes. They can keep the chips and salsa just the way they are, the guacamole is pretty good, but the queso could use some help, kinda tastes like they use a white version of Velveeta.  I mean I know there are some good melting Mexican cheeses out there that can help the queso situation they have going over there. Really I think the only good thing worth ordering in my opinion are the chicken or steak fajitas and sharing with someone. Now as for the beans and rice that come with the fajitas, that's where I think a recipe change needs to happen.  They have been serving those same rice and beans for as long as I can remember and boy are they boring and bland. They just don't have any flavor.  The tortillas they serve, while they may be homemade, they are just to heavy and greasy, you end up filling up on the tortilla and you still have tons meat left for the fajitas. The cheeseburgers are pretty good and huge, but they are kind of out of place at a Mexican restaurant, but my son isn't complaining about that. All the other things I have tried like the plain ole' cheese enchiladas or the tacos are nothing to rave about it all tastes so processed and fat laden, I'll go to Taqueria Corona for those. Like I said I am usually there not because I want a great meal but because I am with friends celebrating, and I think most people go for the same reason which is probably why the place does so well. Anyways, I know I will be back to Superior Grill many more times despite my giving it 3 stars, just kind of wish they could up the quality on their foods.",

The veal was too salty and chewy, but the sauce had a nice light flavor to balance the dish.

It's Bourbon Street so the clientele is generally drunk. It was ok. Noise level average to above average. \n\nService was slow but reasonably nice. \n\nBBQ shrimp - good as advertised but the best part is dipping the free bread in the sauce. \n\nBoiled shrimp - plain. Nothing of note. \n\nRaw oysters - no brine left, far too big. Tasteless. \n\nRoasted oysters - with parm, these were decent. I'd get them again. \n\nHush puppies - good. \n\nFried green tomatoes - disappointing. I've had enough of the NOLA style of cooking which seems to be \"fry the damn thing up.\" I was told by 2 southerners with us that they are not supposed to be battered & fried. \n\nSweet potato fries - good. Worth it. \n\nCrawfish \u00e9touff\u00e9e - decent. Not the best thing in the world but I'd recommend the dish. This is what I came here for and it was decent/ok. \n\nJambalaya - tasted like it was made with hot dogs. After going to Coop's it is almost inedible. \n\nShrimp creole - absolute rubbish. Never get this unless you are in a dungeon and have nothing else to eat. \n\nGeneric po boy - fairly mundane. I'm tired if these sandwiches but even at that this was not good. \n\nOverall you could do worse, but you certainly could do better. Not worth the trip but if you end up there by chance there is good, and bad, food on the menu. Make sure you know what to get and avoid the rubbish.",

Simply beautiful, and with none of the downsides of being in a jungle, like bugs and intense heat. \n\nSo...yeah, that's about it. The restaurants in the middle are also nice to look at, but way overpriced and the food isn't all that great. Another complaint is that it's extremely easy to get lost in there.

We were having a very small wedding shower at the restaurant and the server and manager couldn't have been nicer. They accommodated my request for dessert and were very attentive to our needs the who,e time we were there. Ralph's is a great place for things like this. They have rooms you can use for more privacy but with only 8 people the main restaurant was perfect. Our waiter was quite content letting us sit and open the few presents we had and we never once felt rushed to get up from our table. Very fun atmosphere and wonderful staff. Now the food.  The majority of the table had the crawfish Benedict. This dish is exactly as the name implies. This dish should have been outstanding. Tangy hollandaise and spicy crawfish on one of their delicious biscuits. Sadly it was not. First of all the food was barely warm, bordering on cold. The grilled veggies, which were the side, were cold. There was no seasoning whatsoever on the crawfish and the hollandaise had no taste at all. I was really disappointed. The corned beef hash was warm and the small bite I had was good. It's not your typical hash. The corned beef were cubes of corned beef not shredded like in a hash. That didn't make it any better or worse just different. Their biscuits were DELICIOUS. Warm and flaky and with just that hint of saltiness that makes for the best biscuits. They were light and fluffy and even though they looked as if they might be dense they were not. I wish I had just ordered a plate of biscuits for my brunch. The bottomless mimosas were well ladled with champagne and they were definitely not stingy with the refills. My glass was always full. If your a coffee drinkers, they serve a French press, not just a cup. I had decaf and was not impressed with it. It was very bitter and no amount of cream could help it. I would have preferred just a good old cup of New Orleans Java. No need to serve fancy French press when you already have some of the best coffee.",

    "text": "I'd give the Black Sheep another try. But next time, I'd do it in a group of less than 25 people. We came on a Thursday night, expecting to immediately take over the downstairs section at around 5:30PM. But come to find out, it did not open up until at least 7PM, even later depending on when the bartender got in and got set up.\n\nOur server was as kind as she could be with a whole mess of rowdy professionals on their third beer, wanting to escape her section for the freedom and convenience of the downstairs bar.\n\nAside from the crowded conditions, and the sometimes surly service, the Black Sheep has plenty to offer from great beers on tap to pub food abounding to entrees straight out of Ireland. I'd been here for dinner before and had a relatively good experience then, so I'm not denying that you can have a great night at the Black Sheep. Just don't show up with 25 of your closest friends at happy hour and expect to find seats. It ain't happening.",

There are tons of options around the area which are both tastier and healthier than Wendys around the Vanderbilt University Medical Center.  Most run in the $8 to $10 range.  In the potentially tastier category:\n\n1) Sam and Zoes (this one is a hidden gem) and just across the street.  It gets amazing reviews\n2) Calypso Cafe (this one gets great reviews too) and its just down the road.\n3) Chains like Applebees and Logans",

The fries completely suck - greasy, mushy, and just gross.  \n\nThey had a gumbo special today, which my three-year-old ordered and I ate, which was really good - very smoky flavor with chicken and sausage over rice.  \n\nThey tend to be slow as they make the food to order, but worth the wait as there's absolutely no other option in this part of town.",

    "text": "Food is good. Much better than the average americanized Thai. They got a different twist on the food which makes it original yet authentic. As opposed to other reviews I actually enjoyed the Tom-Yum. It's different than any Tom-Yum I ate in Thailand but still good. I also tried the the Red Curry and some other entrees. All were good. Some very good. Never mind-blowing though.\n\nNow the reason I decided to give it 3 stars is because at the end of the day the food lacks in the bang-for-the-buck department. The portions always seem a little too small and more than a little expensive. For a soup and an entree you'll pay over $20 after taxes, and you're not very likely to have any leftovers. The rice container for the take-out was as small as I've ever seen in any other Asian restaurant I've ever gotten food from.\n\nI live close-by so I'll be back, but not nearly as often as I would like to, unless one of the following happens: the food gets exceptional, the prices drop or the portions get bigger. The restaurant needs to work on giving a more generous air and not feel just a tiny bit stingy.",

    "text": "Bubble tea is one of my (many) vices. It's delicious and I'll never turn down the opportunity for a honeydew bubble tea with tapioca and lychee pieces. So great. Anyways, a friend and I came here for our bubble tea fix and it was a pretty decent experience. I'd come back, but it wasn't anything extraordinary. \n\nIt was busy in there- like every single table was full type busy. People playing games, eating food, drinking tea, the whole thing. That being said, it was also quite loud but that's what you expect when a place is this popular! I'd like to come back and sit and enjoy myself since I only stayed in there for about 10 minutes. \n\nI got a honeydew bubble tea and it was good! I also ordered the spring rolls and they were actually really good as well. The price is decent for what you pay for and they have special deals on different days of the week, so on Tuesdays you get cheap green onion cakes if you buy a bubble tea, on Wednesdays you get cheap spring rolls, etc etc. You get the idea. \n\nThe menu is huge and there are tons of options for bubble tea- you can also get iced teas, shaved ice, hot tea. There is an endless amount of options, really. I was also surprised at the amount of food they had on the menu as well! Also, you can get a stamp card here, when you buy nine bubble tea you get the tenth for free which is great for addicts like myself! \n\nLots of parking in the parking lot even though it may get quite busy, depending on the time you go. There are quite a few other shops in the complex, which probably contributes to the craziness. If you don't want to bother with the crazy parking lot there's an abundance of street parking close by. \n\nThe service wasn't that great when I went, the girls at the till weren't that friendly but I wasn't super bothered by it since they were so incredibly busy. It took a while for my spring rolls and I went up to the counter to ask for them, and they were sitting behind the counter not being called out. The girl was kind of snippy about it but I didn't really care since I just wanted my food. \n\nOverall, not bad. Was worth the visit because the bubble tea was delicious, and I'll probably come back some other time, maybe to enjoy a bigger dish or a game. I take experiences like this as a grain of salt- hopefully I come next time and they're friendlier. If not, I know I can always leave with a delicious drink that I came for.",

    "text": "This place was \"new\" to us and we wanted to go try it out. Walking in, the place felt very homely. I liked how it smelled fragrant, but not as much as other restaurants. \n\nI ordered a yellow curry, my partner ordered the Thai basil, and we got Tom Yum Soup.\nThe curry was not bad, but the consistency of the curry was not good. It was very liquid-y and not enough curry. Okay likely added too much coconut milk. The Tom Yum Soup was great; amazing taste, but only for those who enjoy fragrant and heavy tasting soups. This soup is very strong in both sweet and sour. \n\nThe Thai basil was a bit weird when we got it. It  was really watery; which most Thai basil do not have a large amount of liquid. It also tasted a bit off, the chicken did not taste great. Overall however, it was food: It tasted like amateur cook made the food.\n\nTLDR; If you have not had Thai food before, this place might be okay for you. Normal Thai food tastes like this. However if you have eaten enough Thai food, you will understand that this place is a bit subpar.",

    "text": "This review is a tad bit late...the SO and I came here with our newborn baby for their Easter Sunday brunch. \n\nThe brunch was actually a buffet made up of mostly local ingredients or locally sourced items (e.g., breads and pastries and desserts from Bon Ton Bakery). The price was super reasonable in my opinion ($45/person).\n\nThere were a couple of hot stations as well such as a customized omelette and ham. \n\nI found most of the items to be well made and the variety to be plentiful. The two items I had a problem with were the desserts as I felt they had been sitting out too long and tasted \"off\" but I was assured by the kitchen via our server that the items were okay to be sitting out for that long.\n\nOur server was super pleasant (I think it was her first day?!).\n\nThe restaurant itself is a bright and beautiful space (also located in the Mosaic Centre in the SE of the city)\n\nThe one qualm I have to discuss though (as mentioned in another review by Annie J.) is the lack of change tables for babies in both the ladies and men's washrooms. What gives?! Along with our baby, there was another newborn baby seated at the table behind us and another older baby ahead of us. So families DO come but alas nowhere safe to change babies here. I had to resort to changing my little man on the bench in the shower in the ladies washroom...ugh! But it was tricky since I didn't want him to accidentally roll off so I had to manuever my way through the process by tucking things under my arm and around my wrist.  Needless to say, likely won't be back as long as we have a baby in tow.",

I hadn't been in for a long time, and stopped in for a quick bite and glass of wine around happy hour time. I ordered a glass of wine, which was like $10. Not having a happy hour wine is really annoying, although they do offer a $20 bottle. Adding some glasses of wine to the happy hour menu would be cool. \n\nI ordered the pretzel with cheese. The pretzel was hard as a rock. So hard, in fact, that I couldn't cut it with a steak knife. I only ate about half because I was starving (it was 5pm and I hadn't eaten all day). Strangely enough, I feel like more than one employee saw me struggling to cut the damn pretzel, and no one asked me if everything was OK. Strange. I could have broken a window with that pretzel!

    "text": "I'll start by saying this is moreso a 3.5 star than a 3 star.\n\nAtmosphere:\nAs far as parking goes I would recommend parking on 4th - assuming there is any. We went on a Tuesday afternoon / evening for an early dinner before the Sounds game. They frequently have specials for sounds games and others so be sure you ask your server.\n\nAs far as atmosphere goes it reminded me more-so of a sports bar than a typical pizzeria but it wasn't a bad thing. Who knows, maybe all of the Chicago Pizzeria's are like this? Why Chicago? Cause that's where they're from and you can see all of the Chicago influenced memorabilia on the walls.\n\nI've seen several pictures of the place and I can tell you its even smaller than it looks. By the time we got our food the dinner crowd was piling in and it was crowded. Our seats next to the window resulted in the maze we had to take if we needed to make it to the restroom.\n\nFood:\nThey have a variety of food selection on their menus but if you come to a place called 312 Pizza Company you kind've have to try the deep dish pizza. We ordered a pepperoni deep dish and as soon as we did our waitress let us know it would take anywhere from 30mins - 45mins for it to come out so we ordered an appetizer of wings.\n\nThe wings weren't special in the least bit. They weren't bad but they weren't amazing either.\n\nAs far as drinks go they have a few cocktails but we stuck to the beers. Of which they have an interesting selection of craft beers to choose from, local and non.\n\nOur pie came out after about 30mins and we dug in. Word to the wise - let it cool. I usually hate it when people use forks to eat pizza unless of course its a deep dish. Which I would advise if you decided to go with it then definitely fork it up. As far as the crust goes it was probably one of the best crusts I have ever had on a deep dish. The tomato sauce was just the right amount on the pie - not so little that I was eating crust and not so much that I thought it was a lasagna. As far as the quality of the sauce goes - I've had better. Don't get me wrong it wasn't bad but I wasn't blown away by it. I was still enjoying how great the crust was and I'm not really a crust guy.\n\nService:\nOur waitress was very attentive. I've seen a couple of reviews where the service was lacking but our hostess and waitress were both great. After I finished my first beer she was back like a hawk ready to see if I wanted another. I switched to a can and it felt like she was back every time I took a drink out of it to see if I needed another. It could've been that the dinner crowd didn't show up yet, she was bored, or I come off as a raging alcoholic but I didn't mind.\n\nOverall:\nI definitely see it as a great place for before / after the Sounds games. As far as pizza in Nashville goes its a definite must try. Would I go out of my way to come here? No not really. Would I come back? Absolutely.",

I guess that's to be expected but hate to see it done. Anyway, what was dumped in wasn't that much, so it wasn't an issue, BUT that's probably not always the case. As for the oysters, they were actually a tad smaller than other places, e.g., Felix's. However, they also skimped on the lemon slices as well, going for quarter wedges, which was disappointing since it was barely enough. Anyway, service was slow as all heck (probably waited like 30 min between ordering and getting served) and certainly did not come with a smile either.",

    "text": "We started off with the mussels (Belgian),  it was good, but the mussels were very small. The filet mignon was cooked the way I liked it (MR), but it was not seasoned well, if at all and the outer side tasted burnt. The lump crab was minimal, and the mashed potatoes were not anything out of the ordinary, but the asparagus was cooked properly. The hollandaise sauce was gelatinous and looked to be left out for a while; I did not care for that. Everything is a la carte (which basically means eat less or pay more). We ordered mushroom risotto and the brussel sprouts with the dinner. It is very hard to find good risotto, but at Marmont, the risotto was well cooked and tasty. The brussel sprouts were good, but it would have been nice to have it seasoned, but I suppose that is what the bacon and shallots are for. If the prices were lowered or if the entrees included one side, I would try this place again.",

It's a smaller space with a cute atmosphere. Drink menus are in cute old kids books. \n\nBrunch -- My party got the confit pork belly and eggs, cinnamon roll pancakes, corned beef hash and eggs, and the huevos. The confit pork belly and eggs was good but not quite what I expected, I wouldn't order it again. The corned beef on the other hand was out of this world. Very salty and has a kick but not in a bad way. My friend said that the huevos were delicious. The pancakes were out of this world. The cinnamon and sugar on top was a crunchy caramelized texture that really added to the pancakes. Loved them \nAlso side note. The biscuits were good but not nearly as delicious as other reviewers claimed (at least in my book!) \n\nDinner -- their Mac and cheese is delicious. I make sure to always get a side no matter what I'm eating. \n\nOverall good food, good drinks, ok service.",

    "text": "Marrakesh is obviously all about the experience. From the low-key location on Leithgow Street to the doorbell you have to ring and wait to be greeted before entering. The interior is dimly lit and full of vibrant colors from tapestries and decorated pillows that adorn the seating areas. Our party of six was seated in a backroom upstairs - incredibly comfortable and got me excited for the meal.\n\nThe waiter first arrives and asks for very few decisions about the 7-course meal. We opted for the spicy chicken and then the lamb entree, accompanied by a vegetarian option for our one friend. We also ordered two carafes of cheap wine - $12 each. The waiter then returns with a partner carrying a giant metal bowl with a teapot on top. He asks that everyone puts their hands in the center of the table then pours water over them and asks you to wash up; a towel is placed over everyones' hands to dry off. They soon return with smaller towels that are draped over your laps in indication of the messy meal that will soon begin.\n\nThe first course is a three-salad platter consisting of cucumber and tomato - coriander marinated carrots and cooked eggplant in tomato sauce. They bring out a giant basket full of pita breads and offer you to take as many as you'd like. This salad was delicious and probably my favorite part of the meal. Next is a giant pie made of phyllo dough stuffed with scrambled eggs, parsley and ground chicken. It's topped with powdered sugar and cinnamon. This wasn't well received because the chicken was sparse and the dish was too sweet overall. It was also very hard to eat the crumbly ground chicken and eggs with your hands.\n\nTwo main courses are presented - the first being an entire roasted chicken covered in a spicy cumin sauce. This chicken was delicious, perfectly cooked but the skin was not crispy enough for my taste, fortunately it was easy to remove. Next is a roasted lamb shank off the bone, covered in honey and slivered almonds. The meat was cooked well but like the chicken pie, this dish was way too sweet for my tastes. Finally is a couscous with chick peas, raisins and shredded chicken. I prefer my couscous sticky and salty but this was very sweet and moist, almost stew-like.\n\nFor dessert you are brought a plate of bananas, oranges and apples, a plate of delicious baklava and very sweet hot mint tea.\n\nOverall Marrakesh is a lot of fun - you get to experience a traditional Moroccan meal and have plenty of time to relax and chat with your friends. I would have prefered less sweet and more savory dishes but others might disagree. Expect to spend around two hours eating. After wine we thought it was a bit pricey but still not too bad for the city - it came to about $37 a person including tip.",

I ordered a slice and some garlic knots while the rest of my party ordered 2 sandwiches. The waitress brought my slice and garlic knots together, then brought the other orders about 10 minutes later... She also asked if we wanted refills on our EMPTY glasses when she brought the slice, we didn't get our drinks until we were done eating our food.

At the time they had 2 waitresses working, 1 lady working the cash register and 3 or 4 cooks.\n\nMy other complaint is when ordering over the phone for pickup.

I have even tried paying by CC with hopes they would make the order before I showed up...

They are pretty slow with service - always a good 25 minutes for your order (even for something simple). I have had a few bad experiences here but the chicken cheesesteaks keep me coming back. One time I ordered a single slice of white pizza. My boyfriend received his food but no one called out my food so I went up and asked how much longer my slice would be. Then I found out one of the employees ate my slice of pizza after I ordered it (which was the last one) and no one bothered to ask me if I wanted something else. The onion rings are good too.

    "text": "Once again St. Louis has spoiled me. The Whole Foods right outside of STL (Brentwood), had got me excited about Whole Foods once more. First with Graeters and secondly (and more often once Graeters appeared more places) with their outstanding to-go sandwiches and pastry selection.\n\nThis location, however, lacks an impressive (or even good) pastry section. Their pastry case is all of two or three feet long. The one in St. Louis? Probably four times that length. \n\nWhere were the cream puffs? The non mini tarts? Or any fruit tarts besides mixed berry? Where were the french inspired pastries? Or the vegan ones? Where was any of this?\n\nInstead there were pudding cups (I bought one - it was very pretty and did use very rich chocolate, but was still just a bit better than a normal pudding cup), creme brulee, two types of macaron flavors, and only a few cakes (albeit I am sure you can call in advance to order others as you can at most Whole Foods). There were mini tarts, but all the same mixed berry flavors... There was no layered deserts or tiramisu.\n\nIt was just a below average bakery selection and it left me sad (as I had driven there hungry and wanting pastries)\n\nMaybe the other location in Indy will prove more fruitful? (Or pastry case full)",

We've been here several times. 3 years ago we were here for our 10th anniversary and they couldn't have been nicer or more attentive. We can back for our anniversary tonight and we were disappointed. No acknowledgement of the occasion, even though it was noted on the reservation. The back room we were seated in was extremely loud, our server, while polite and friendly, was less than attentive - my wine took a long time to arrive and he never checked to see if I'd like a second glass, we didn't get a refill on water until the end of the meal, food took longer than usual to be served but the check sure showed up quickly. The food itself was good but again, not as good as in the past. My husband is a huge fan of the gumbo and said that this time, it simply wasn't as good.  Nothing was bad but we feel the place has slipped. It won't be first on our list of places in NOLA anymore.",

The pulled pork was nice and the chips were alright, but the cheese was like when you make nachos at home and microwave or otherwise melt shredded cheese over chips and then it re-coagulates... Yeah it was like that. I think it would have been much better if they had maybe heating up the chips, put the pork on them and then dropped the cheese onto the hot chips and let them melt it. That said, it was a generous portion and it was filling as a meal. \n\nI think everyone else at the table got a burger.

    "text": "I've seen complaints here about the price, but I felt like my steak and frites were fairly priced @ $15.  for lunch. The steak was a good portion was very tasty and well cooked.  I liked the onion and butter on it too: made it yummy and  special (a nod by the chef that,  even thought it was just steak, he/she were willing to make the effort). Now that I know they nailed the steak I will be back for the more adventurous items on the menu. The mussels were very fresh and tasty.  The broth was subtle and delicious. I don't like it when the broth is too garlicky or salty--not a problem.  I liked the dessert: a goat cheese cheesecake--sweet and fluffy.  If they didn't make it there, it was close by at the hands of someone who knew what they were doing.  I hate being served a Costco cheesecake that is not fresh and overly cold from recent thawing, and frankly you get that a lot in Tucson.  The creme brulee was very tasty too: big portion with tangy blueberries and strawberries.  Wait staff was very good.  Smiled and were nice, but not phony.  I like staff that are engaged in their work, but not too earnest or chatty--good job. The room was comfortable, cool (it was 106 outside) and clean.  The table was sturdy (Tucson restaurants, why is this such a continual issue out there?) and the chairs substantial and cool looking. \n\nWhy I can't give Maynard's a 4 or 5 stars rating yet: I think it's cheap of them not to offer bread with the mussels (I had to ask, granted it was nice bread!).  The Bloody Mary tasted bad.  It had a neato bit of asparagus, but it tasted like a Slim Jim and was pretty weak on the liquor side of the equation.  It was bad enough to send back, but I chocked it down.  I just won't put out $8 bucks for a cocktail here again.  The 'frites sauce' is catsup: not special catsup either. Wine--yes red wine is supposed to be room temp. But that means about 65 degrees or so.  I think it had maybe sat at the bar overnight and warmed a bit much? Serving Zin that warm gives it a harsh edge and a stale feel.  Thank god I was having a steak with it.  The choice of 'warm' wine might be the sommelier's style.  Which is fine, but forget about me agreeing by buying more.\n\nI will go back and order something more challenging food wise.  To be on the safe side, I will have a simpler cocktail and enjoy a beer with my food.",

Had to flag down a waiter just to get water, then finally got our bar and food order in, only to have our waiter disappear and never return.  We  sat there nearly an hour with only water, and could not get anyone to help us, so we decided to call it a night and head to another favorite St. Charles restaurant.  To be fair, the place was super busy, but it won't stay that way if the service is bad.  Seems like it could be a fun place.",

    "text": "Probably the best Italian in the West Chester area that has a full bar. This place has grown so much over the years, from a small BYOB to expanding and becoming packed every night (so make reservations). Because of the popularity, they use every space available and the result is a somewhat cramped and loud atmosphere.\n\nThe food isn't the best Italian in the area but certainly holds its own. It's a little on the pricy side but they put a lot of care into everything they do and make dinner an experience. You'll get started with complimentary bruschetta and bread. For appetizers, I'd recommend the grilled seafood which comes with calamari, scallops, and shrimp. They've also got a good assortment of antipastos. The meat and pasta dishes are all solid, a mix of American-Italian dishes and a few things that I've never heard of. The only dessert I've had is the key lime cheesecake which is delicious, but pricy for what you get. At the end you'll get offered some complimentary Limoncello shots as well.\n\nThey also do a lunch buffet during the week. It includes pastas, salads, and pizzas. Probably the best deal around. \n\nService has always been good, the only reason it might seem slow is if they're getting slammed, but I wouldn't say that's they're fault. \n\nOverall, if you don't have a bottle of wine or want some nice cocktails or a beer, this is the best spot to go if you're in the mood for Italian. It's better than Teca, but I'd recommend Core de Roma over for food (BYOB). Either way, you'll get a good meal here:",

Their Proven\u00e7ale had previously been a blend of olive oil, herbs, tomatoes and garlic saut\u00e9ed to perfection.  I've always asked for this dish without onions.  Today the olive oil with Herbs de Provence, garlic etc. was completely missing.  The waitress told me she had no idea why they did that.  It was just dry fried tofu with a bit of tomato and herbs. I was so disappointed that this excellent dish had been botched.  She took it back and returned with what tasted like a lesser olive oil and nearly raw garlic added to my existing plate.  I guess I won't be returning, which is too bad because I adored that dish.",

The charro beans didn't have as much flavor as I'd hoped.  The Tamale was good however the masa was the mushy corn/mealy type not the authentic tamale I'm used to and love.  The beef taco tasted fine but in looking at the meat it was a greyish blob that looked like half a hamburger patty, a little strange.  Again, it tasted fine but not what I'd expect in a place like this.\n\nThe red salsa had a good kick with good flavor.  The sala verde was way too thick.  I love salsa verde and this was a big disappointment.\n\nService was good.  \n\nIt was a decent meal but I've had better and that's exactly how two stars is defined by YELP but that seemed inappropriately low.

    "text": "So I got the MEMO about the 50 cents oyster @ Happy Hour...and during our visit to NOLA...we were so eager to go to eat as many oysters possible at a steal deal price!\n\nArrived around 4ish on a HOT (week)day. We both were tourists..wearing shorts, t-shirts and sandals just like MOST others in the bar (happy) hour area. The hostess was friendly but the waiter was just a plain @$$ ...pardon my language here.\n\nYup, we got the head to toe look and he walked around and talked to us with his nose pointing to the ceiling, oh, come on!! We didn't care really... all we wanted were just some fresh oysters and great beer to wash away the heat.\n\nWe ordered a dozen of the oysters and the duck liver and rabbit pate $8 with two glasses of beer (we later got a second round of beer).\n\nThe oysters came out slowly.. we almost finished our beer when they arrived. They looked grossed and not cleaned well. I understand it was 50 cents each..but they shouldn't cut corners on cleanliness especially while serving raw food plus they are a fancy restaurant..how do you expect us to come back for the pricier dinner if you can't even clean the oysters well?\n\nWe were thinking to order a couple more dozens but the fact that we tasted the debris from the oyster shucking process in each oyster PLUS the unappetizing look of the small shells sticking on the oyster' shells.. we just got turned off!\n\nThe pate was excellent and we loved the pickled cucumber etc and the warm toasted bruchetta that came with it and $8 was certainly worth the priced. We licked it clean!!\n\nWe were planning to go to Luke for a couple times during our NOLA visit and even considered going there for dinner (we watch food network and top chef masters) BUT our not-so-great first (and only) happy hour experience @ Luke left none to desire to come back.\n\nOur total tab including tax and tip was about $40... they get you on the alcohol..\n\nThe pate is a 4 to 5 stars..the oyster price is also a 5 stars, BUT the snotty service and lack of cleanliness didn't make the cut..so I'm giving Luke a fair 3 stars.",

    "text": "My friend and I decided to catch up at Ooka last night and enjoy some Habachi cookin'.  Lets just say it's been a while.  We got sat at the big table of 8 with 1 other couple with the big grill between us.  Our waitress brought us some really awesome miso soup (tofu-less?) and salad with fresh veggies, and really amazing ginger dressing.  I pretty much inhaled mine.  As the token vegetarian, I was a bit bummed that Ooka hasn't embraced tofu the way that a lot of asian cuisine has.. so i ordered the veggie meal.  My friend went for the chicken.  I was really impressed that when the chef went to cook, he made all the veggies first, then the meat so there was no possibility of 'contamination'.  While I'm not that strict of a vegetarian, I appreciate that sort of consideration.  \n\nOur chef was fantastic.  He made us laugh, we were in awe of his skills, and the food was delicious.  We had plenty of time to catch up and hang out and relax.  The meal really was a high spot in my week.  It was a bit on the salty side though, which had me drinking lots of water all night.\n\nI only wish i had known that the restaurant was a BYOB.

    "text": "Many who are familiar with celebrity chefs will recognize the name: John Besh. A Southern boy, Besh is a well-known chef throughout the city, owning several restaurants. We decided on L\u00fcke for our first dinner. According to the website, it is Besh' \"homage to the grand old Franco-German brasseries that once reigned in New Orleans.\"\n\nWe made reservations for 5:30 and we're greeted and seated promptly upon arrival. Our waiter was Lee, who had been on vacation for a little while. It showed. More on that later. I decided to order the nightly 3-course pri-fixe special. My wife decided to choose her own. First off for me was seafood gumbo \u00e1 la Creole. The gumbo itself had good flavor, but some of the rice was burnt and one of the oysters had a lot of grit.\n\nMy wife ordered the Shrimp Bisque. It was very flavorful and enjoyable. With a velvety consistency.\n\nFor my entree I had the navarin d'agneau braised lamb with gnocchi and Covey Rise vegetables. I had never had braised lamb before. It was okay, but needed more seasonings. Unfortunately, the stars of the dish were the supporting cast: the gnocchi and vegetables.\n\nMy wife had the shrimp farci (with blood orange hollandaise, crabmeat and shrimp). It was very enjoyable with the hollandaise really elevating the dish.\n\nAgain, my meal came with 3 courses. We were both quite satiated at this point, but dessert came with the meal. The original bread pudding that came out had a hair on it. Immediately it was sent back to the kitchen. The manager apologized, and brought out two new desserts! TWO! We could only pick at each of them. The first was a \"gateau basque\" vanilla cake with blackberries and cr\u00e8me fraiche. We were split on this one; I enjoyed it, while my wife thought it was kind of boring for a dessert. The second dessert we were brought was a chocolate pot de creme. It was very enjoyable with some chocolate pieces on top adding to the texture play.\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, we would come back to our waiter. Lee, though nice, would come by every 2 minutes to make sure everything was okay. The service was thus suffocating at best. We kept getting interrupted in the middle of our conversations due to him \"checking up\" on us. \n\nThe food at L\u00fcke was decent, nothing that made me say WOW! But it seems like a good restaurant. Perhaps the service problems we had was related to Lee only, but it put a bad taste in our mouth for the restaurant. Maybe next time we're in NOLA, we'll give John Besh another chance. (We hear that Restaurant August is AMAZING!)",

I ordered the eggs benedict and honestly couldn't see the food because of how much hollandaise was on there. My husband ordered the Asian breakfast and was not impressed. Very packed and not really able to enjoy the game so we went elsewhere. Overall not bad- service at the bar was great but a little overrated in my opinion.",

    "text": "Could have been better. Dinner seemed a little rushed - it was a Thursday night so it was not extremely busy for them, I attribute it more to the server not being dialed in to his customer - which isn't great for a somewhat romantic setting. (I often wonder why the server hasn't noticed that we haven't even opened our menus yet.) \nThe food was pretty good, pasta bolognaise and a salad to start. But my criticism is this, which I hope the owners read & heed: we were at an outside table and it was a lovely evening. The sun had set and there was plenty of light thanks to the street lights in the borough, but at some point they threw on the overhead spotlights which was an immediate rude awakening. The table of females behind us gasped collectively as well and actually screamed when the burst of light brought bugs to our tables and specifically a beetle into the hair of one of them. And what seemed worse was that when we all asked that they kill the offensive lighting, the answer twice was that they didn't want to \"appear closed\" to potential customers. Not only was this strange because clearly with people inside and out at tables eating it appeared quite open but it was annoying because the focus was more on the would-be customer rather than their actual customers (who were now unwitting participants in their marketing scheme).",

    "text": "Today was my first time visiting a Red Robin. I had heard many good things about them from friends and family and decided to take my Brother out for an early birthday lunch and a movie. The restaurant appeared very clean and service was friendly and professional with just one tiny lapse. The burgers were great and I was happy with the fact that the waitress didn't bat an eye when I ordered mine medium rare. I have had restaurants tell me they won't serve burgers below medium and that just tells me that they don't trust the quality of their meat or kitchen staff. The fries were a bit of a disappointment though. My brother had bragged about how good they were and since we were in shortly after opening at 11 AM, I expected them to be hot and fresh. While they weren't horrible, they weren't very warm and several of mine were very hard, like they had been left to either cook too long or sat under a heat lamp for far too long. Again, they weren't horrible, it just seemed strange for them not to be fresh so early in the day. All in all, I would happily go back again. \nMy one issue is something that is common to a lot of restaurants. I am a big guy at 6'1\" and around 315 lbs. Many restaurants, Red Robin included, have booths with their tables firmly mounted to the floor. As a hostess, if you have a larger customer coming in, it might behoove you to consider seating your diner somewhere where they can be comfortable. The restaurant was sparsely populated and there were regular tables and chairs, high top tables, and even bar seating that would have been far more comfortable for me rather than having me try and squeeze into a booth. Yes, I know that the simple answer is, \"lose weight!\", but that doesn't change the fact that you should always try and make your customer comfortable.",

The building/porch roof badly needs attention.  Once inside, the dining areas are nicely appointed albeit needing a little TLC.  The main dining room has 7-8 tables and it can be very difficult to have a quiet dinner over the discussions of the other diners.  In hindsight, we should have asked to be seated in the smaller dining room with the fireplace.  Our appetizers were very good and fresh - shrimp cocktail for me and the shrimp/lobster bisque for my wife.  For dinner, I had the NY Strip and my wife had the Filet Mignon.  Both of our steaks were excellent.  Only complaint was from my wife as her mashed potatoes were ice cold in the middle.  Dessert was apple streusel and raspberry tort, both very good.  Service was excellent.  It was pricey ($180 including tip) but we'd go back.  I sincerely hope that the owners invest in the property as it is an iconic Chester County location.",

    "text": "We were at Oakleys Bistro last evening, Feb. 12th. This was our 3rd outing there and I am still not impressed with the restaurant. Their bar drinks are on the expensive side, but only average in quality. Our total dinner bill for two people, including two cocktails was $100 not including gratuity. \nWe were there to celebrate my wife's birthday. She ordered the Sea Bass which she said was quite good. On the other hand, I ordered the Wild Boar Rigatoni which was just on the adequate side in terms of taste and quality. The sauce and rigatoni were good, however the \"wild boar\" was barely edible. It tasted old, was overlooked, dry with a rubbery quality that even the sauce could not improve. Quite disappointing, especially given the price. The lettuce wedge salad was also underwhelming and truly overpriced. I know this is an expensive restaurant and don't mind paying prices when eating out, but I expect better quality for those prices. \nOn the plus side, my wife was presented with a complimentary dessert which she said was excellent. Our waiter was excellent, never hovering yet was attentive at the appropriate times, allowing us to enjoy the meal. \nBecause we were there with two other couples I decided not to return my meal and ask for something else because I didn't wasn't to delay things or call attention to our evening, but I truly was dissatisfied with my meal. Oakleys is not high on my recommend list even though others seemed to enjoy their meal, given that this was my third visit there and still feel the quality is not up to par with the pricing. I have given Oakleys a weak 3 stars.",

Nice touches include starting with a fresh, delicious roll, roasted red peppers, razor thin sliced onions, and well-paired cheese.  For $5.99 and ready made, you can't go wrong for the neighborhood.  Overall, the store is nice, with a lot of items, if you look hard enough.  They also tend to have some really good sales (esp. meats) so, have a look.

They can fix it, but they need to pay attention.  \n\nWhen you order a sandwich.  It comes with fries. Many people don't like fries.  But I can't substitute with fried yucca.  Even though the fries and the fries yucca a re priced the same as sides. \n\nMakes no sense.  I hate things that make no sense.\n\nThen there's the 50 cent charge for a tiny little side of sauce.  It's tiny.  And I can't help but feel they're nickel and diming me. If someone just ordered two full meals and needs a little extra sauce, seems to me they shouldn't charge.  And if they are going to charge, use a little larger container please.  \n\nIt's my pet peeves.  But I'm my opinion, it's things like these what's holding this place back from being just good to being great. \n\nGood tastes great though.  Come check it out.  Hope you like fries.",

One other barista is working drive thru - not tons of cars in line (1or2), but engaged. Looks like another barista may be coming on.\n\nOkay, so I'll just order on the app & see what happens?\n\nTwo other customers came in & ordered after me. Manager finished the call & took an order - boom delivered. Next order delivered.\n\nDon't see my order at pick up, guess I'll get off here and go check in. Not the best SBucks in town. Oh wait, my name was just called - received my drink, but I'm thinking I may have to ask for my bakery item, hmm, yeah the barista is helping a new customer now.\n\nThe kid that just came on and is taking over the DThru seems pretty sharp. Shift manager is tag-teaming the order for the new customer, I think? Another customer has come in - maybe four min ago - not acknowledged until the barista was ready to take the order.\n\nMan, I want my bakery item ... lots of gnats where I'm standing btw. Latest customer (a new one) doesn't look to pleased?\n\nOh, just got asked if I was waiting on another mobile order - gonna get my bakery item, yes!\n\nGot it, oh & the barista apologized for the wait (that's what I'm taking about, a little acknowledgment goes a long way). Ah, Just realize the shift manager was making a big ole fancy drink just before announcing \"see you after my 10 min break\".\n\nI'll give another star - I don't like complaining. Just wish I could have been greeted with a \"hi or hello or good afternoon\" maybe a \"we'll be right with you.\" Just a side note - no napkins, tables are dirty. I'm thinking this could be a fantastic SBucks w/a little better management & a lot of hard work. Realize this is more a play by play/commentary, not done many reviews. Thanks for letting me vent. I'll be back. I'm a sucker. Plus, maybe I could be an encouragement, maybe help somehow & right?",

My husband wanted to drive to Philadelphia to get and they didn't have it on the menu anymore. We ordered it on the Seabass, and picked off the tiny little piece on each serving and it was phenomenal. Would've been nice to of been just able to order it like the old days. The only tea was green and it was meh. On the positive side, the miso soup was the best I've ever had, and the cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e dessert was fantastic. I also had the lunch sushi sashimi plate and none of it was really outstanding. Even the salmon had that flavor like it it was previously frozen. It wasn't battery and fresh tasting.

    "text": "This place is pretty excellent- definitely a go-to for me and the BF.  Some notes:\n\n-HAPPY HOUR and LATE NIGHT:  Happy Hour is 5-7 weekdays, and gets you half-price margaritas ($2.50 is hard to beat).  Late night is Sunday-Thursday 10pm-12am, and gives you half-price margaritas AND draft beers (usually they have a few decent craft beers).\n\n*update- all specials have gone up :( bummer.  Alas! \n\n\n-$1 per person endless chips, smoked pico de gallo and salsa verde- DELICIOUS, and perfect happy hour/late night food\n\n-Be wary: the margaritas can pack a punch.  It may be the cheap tequila, but inevitably these hit me after the fact in a weird and often headache and/or hangover-inducing manner that margaritas (even strong ones) don't usually give me.  Drink lots of water, that's for sure- and don't let this deter you.  \n\n-Vegetarian Texas Cheesesteak?  AMAZING.\n\n-Brunch includes a free drink for each adult over $21 (Bloody Mary or Mimosa).  VEGETARIANS BE WARNED- the Bloody Mary mix is NOT vegetarian, and not all of the waiters know that.  I asked, was told it was vegetarian, had my BF try it, asked again to have them double-check, and found out it wasn't.  I lucked out, but if you are allergic to seafood or vegetarian, stick with the Mimosa and make sure the waiters double-check anything that could mess with your dietary restrictions.",

The inside looks really similar but it's been freshened up and looks cleaner.  \n\nIn my experience with St Louis sushi, Wasabi on Washington (only because I've never eaten at the Clayton local as I try to never eat west of Big Bend) is the standard against which all others should be judged.  Based upon this Wasabi standard, Kampai comes pretty close.  The sushi was fresh and the rolls were well made.  Miso soup and a small salad come with every meal and they were fine.  Finally, Kampai is priced well. When my sushi posse hit a place, we order a lot of food, and our bill at Kampi was less that it would normally be at Wasabi.  Their rolls are not as creative or interesting as Wasabi, but then they don't charge as much either.  \n\nI would recommend Kampai to anyone.",

On my quest to try as many local restaurants in the area, my journey led me to Mei's world, a Taiwanese restaurant and pizza join all rolled into one. Crazy combination, right? I had to check it out. The first visit, service was very friendly albeit a little slow. I had a pork chop and rice dish. The price was inexpensive, but the flavor was a bit lacking. The second visit, I decided to try the trademark General Tso's pizza. When I asked about a question on the menu, the guy that answered seemed completely annoyed by inquiry. It was a huge departure from my first visit, but I wouldn't be so annoyed if the pizza was on point. Honestly... It was simply ok, but I wouldn't exactly go out of my way for mediocre pizza and hit or miss service. I guess service varies depending on who waits for you. There seems to be a bit of a language barrier, but eh. I'll stick to Yummy House on Waters or Golden Phoenix for my Chinese food fix.",

I was hoping it'll taste authentic, but I guess they made it more Americanized which is kind of understanding. I ordered the papaya salad (thum ma hoong) for appetizer, it tasted okay... Down side was that it was too plain for me, didn't really taste like the flavor I was hoping for.  The pad see ew was also so flavorless, I wanted to get a taste of toasty-ness from the noodles. Lastly, the desert. I ordered the sweet mango sticky rice which is my favorite Thai desert ever and I was really upset with this one. The sticky rice was more on the soggy side than sticky side. The coconut cream was just slapped on top of the sticky rice which I don't know why because it's suppose to be mixed together with the sticky rice. Also the mango wasn't ripe, it was hard & not as sweet as it should be. The only thing that pleased me was the beef jerky (seen hang), it was really chewy & flavorful with seasoning & a side of a sweet spicy tangy sauce which made it taste 10x better. Although, the food wasn't to my likings, the service & the environment was great & soothing. Which was the reason for the 3 stars. Friendly staff, but horrible food.",

Not only was the salmon in small supply, it tasted like over-cooked frozen salmon rather than smoked salmon as advertised (definitely not a deal with the $12.00 price tag that comes along with it). Even though the eggs, potatoes, and other fixings of the dish tasted great, the core aspect of the dish was severely lacking - especially compared to the other items ordered at the restaurant. I was able to use hot sauce to mask the flavor of the fish. \n\n------------------------------------------------\n\nLocation: (Not a factor in the rating)\n\nPrep & Pastry is a very nice and aesthetic looking restaurant. There are a lot of places to park even if the lot is full and we only waited about 30 min on a Holiday Sunday at noon. \n\n------------------------------------------------\n\nService: 5 / 5 Stars\n\nThe servers were very nice and accommodating at the restaurant.

The biscuits were very disappointing. Cake Cafe puts them to shame. It's also advertised as a juice bar, which is definitely not a term I'd use to describe the place. $7 is a little much for a cup of orange juice with some cucumber in it.",

It's dark, the furniture is heavy, and it screams old-fashioned, it's just plain *somber*. I just couldn't imagine coming here to celebrate anything, or for a date, it's just too depressing and stifling.\n\nAs for the food, well, I said above I may have ordered the wrong thing. I ordered a lamb dish, and what I got was a chunk of meat with the bone still sticking out of it. Think Fred Flintstone. I am not kidding. It tasted good, but there was just no graceful way to eat it. It was very hard to get a good angle on it with a knife and fork, and I'm not the kind of girl who is going to go all Henry VIII on a leg of lamb in the middle of a restaurant!\n\nThe service, however, was excellent. Very attentive and professional. \n\nI will probably go back at some point, but next time I'm trying a different entree.",

The food was tasty, it was also served cold: two out of 4 appetizers (both were soups) were sent back because of the temperature and three of four mains were sent back for the same reason.  The wait staff was excellent and corrected the issues quickly and professionally so the issues did not \"ruin\" our evening. Despite the temperature issues, the food was very good, service excellent and atmosphere was average.  In my opinion Mr. B's Bistro earns a 3 out of 5 rating because the overall experience fell short of the expectations of a pricey Bistro.",

    "text": "Needing to run an errand in Moorestown during my lunch break, I figured I would pickup lunch while in town, too.  I did a quick Google search before leaving the office (no Yelp access at work) and came across The Cubby Hole.  Looked like a pretty good lunch spot, so to The Cubby Hole I went.\n \nThe caf\u00e9 is small, but quaint, in typical Moorestown fashion.  The girl behind the counter handed me a menu and also directed me to their specials board. I felt that their menu was a little lacking in vegetarian selections.  The only cold sandwich option was egg salad (which they were out of today), and the hot selections were basically variations of grilled cheese. No vegetarian selections on the specials board either.  I could have gone for like a grilled veggie Panini.  \n\nNo worries, though.  I ordered a mozzarella, tomato, and balsamic Panini.  I went to run my errand while I waited for my lunch to be prepared.  I also had to stop at an ATM because I learned when I got there that they take CASH ONLY.  I ran my errand, picked up my lunch, and went back to the office.  \n\nBy the time I got back to the office, my Panini was still warm, and was really good. The balsamic vinegar gave it a nice flavor, and the tomatoes were fresh.  The Panini was grilled just perfectly.\n\nI give The Cubby Hole 3 stars, A-OK.  They definitely lose a star for being cash only.  I never carry cash.  Also, I'd like to see a more extensive menu for vegetarians.  That said, I would definitely come here again when I'm in town.",

If you go I highly recommend the pork belly and the lamb sliders. Our service was horrendous, hence the three stars. It's kind of like a tapas place in that you get a bunch of plates to share amongst your table. We were sitting there for 45 minutes without food that had been ordered. Eventually I had to inquire about the issue. Server came back and said that the order \"never got put in\" without taking any ownership of the mistake or apologizing. I was certain some consideration would have been taken when the bill came, but it was 100% full price. When the server gave us the bill her comment was \"at least you had some romantic time together between courses.\" Awful way to close the night considering there are plenty of ways to spend time in New Orleans that are more romantic than sitting in a restaurant waiting on food and feeling like you've been forgotten.

The interior was really, really big and there were TV's everywhere, but it was very outdated. \n\nThe service was super slow but friendly, and the food was pretty standard. We ordered garlic parmesan zingers, a full rack of baby back ribs, and a house salad; we split everything. We also got soft drinks which were easily 32 oz. big each. I've never seen single serve glasses that big at a restaurant! \n\nAll in all, we would go back, if and I mean IF we are in the area.

    "text": "While I did not eat here I am extremely disappointed with Katie's Pizza. This past Friday night, I went to Katie's for girls night. While the pizza and pasta they ordered they had enjoyed. I had two glasses of their house wine ($9 each glass). I had asked for the check and when I received it I saw it was $19.55. I gave the waiter (who had asked us 5+ times if we were still okay, clearly ready for us to leave) $15 cash, told him to take $5 for a tip and said put the rest on my card. I got the bill back, I signed without really paying attention (which is my fault). I looked at the receipt when I got home and saw that he had charged my card $15 and kept the rest of my cash for himself! I was extremely upset, but there was nothing I could do at that point. So my advice to you if you decide to go to Katie's pizza is to really look at the bill and make sure that they are charging your card correctly! This is not a place I would expect waiters to do this but unfortunately it is.",

    "text": "Went here for the first time a couple weeks ago to watch the NBA Playoffs with a friend.\n\nThe good stuff: \nthe hostess was very friendly and welcoming, chatted with us, and moved us to a great spot to watch the game. There are tons of screens which is great for watching sports. \nThe waiter was also very attentive and nice, always ready with water and to take orders for beer. There was no particular thing that I can remember, but I just recall thinking at the end of the night \"I liked our waiter\".\n\nThe ok stuff: \nBeer selection was fine, not too large of a selection, but at least one of the major styles. The only issue was that the sizes of beers weren't specified on the menu.\nThe cheesesteak empanada were alright.\n\nThe bad: \nThe sweet potato fries were very undercooked and hard. My friend even gave his to me, because he couldn't eat them. I only ate them because I was coming off a 48 hour fast, and could have eaten cardboard at that point. \n\nThe burger (The Philly Special) was also pretty disappointing. It was cooked to my liking and juicy, but lacking in any flavor. I wouldn't order it again.\n\nOverall:\nA good place to have some drinks and watch sports, but stick to the appetizers and get dinner elsewhere.",
