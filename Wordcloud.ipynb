            "['Tried ordering online. When I asked for topping suggestions the guy hung up on me. Ridiculous', \"You get what you see--chicken fingers. They also serve wings and other overpriced items like mac and cheese (mediocre) and pastries (meh). \\n\\nThe sauces are unique and probably the best part about this place as you won't be able to find sauces like this elsewhere. Be watchful of how full the sauce is because some of the containers are not completely full and you get jipped. Sadly you can't sample the sauces without having to buy them. My favorite is bar b q sauce. It has a slight acidic vinegar kick, but isn't bittersweet. Maybe they cut back on the sugar? The chipotle lime mayo is great. It isn't too creamy and oily. The chipotle is subtle, almost dull and a little bit more would make it better and bold. I found myself having to double dunk the chicken in this sauce to really taste it. You always finish it wishing you had a little more. I've tried almost all of them and none of them are too memorable that I can recall anything great or bad about the rest of the sauces.\\n\\nThe breading is thin and crisp, which I appreciate. With one bite you taste the breading and chicken, and not just breading on heavily breaded chicken that other places might serve. The breading can be over salty and seasoned too much. Don't mistake this for rich and intense. It is salty. I end up drinking a lot of water with this meal partially due to this. What makes the breading suck is that it is not always fresh. Who knows how long the chicken has been sitting out.\\n\\nThe meat can be hit or miss; the chicken can be a little parched. This is disappointing when you have a whole pound of chicken to consume that will leave your mouth dry and leave you bloated after you drink a lot to quench your thirst and high sodium intake. More often then not, I always get the dried, salty chicken instead of the juicy, tender chicken that I once got at my very first visit. Perhaps I am unlucky and get the left over stale pieces that have been sitting out long. I can only recall once when my chicken was tender and juicy when they first opened.I try to avoid wasting money here because I have not had the same type of meal since my first. However, out of desperation to try something different than the usual univ city food, I have eaten here a few times to make this review justified.\\n\\nWhat my friends and I would like to do is split up and someone get french fries from Greek Lady and the others get chicken from Wishbone. We would satisfy our elementary palates by eating chicken fingers and french fries. If you are willing to walk a few more blocks, Allegros has really good curly fries but portions are a lot bigger when you eat at the place.\\n\\nI would have given this place 1.5 stars for the food, but they once cancelled a chicken wing eating contest on my friends and me just hours prior to the event with poor explanation so I knock it down to 0.5 stars, but yelp doesn't have 0.5 increments.\", 'The service and bathroom was horrible, The soap Dispenser didn\\'t work (and the toilets were out of order) Zaxby\\'s need to do better with who they are hiring and the cleanliness of the store. The lady at the drive thru and the cooks did not have on a hair net. The sweet tea was sour, the ice machine took forever (it seems like) to dispense ice. The chicken strips and fries were dry. The person taking my order was not welcoming at all. All the employees on the front line seem to be playing around rather then working. A lot of lout talking coming from the back. Not a inviting environment at all, I will not come back to this location and I \"suggest\" strongly that \"You\" think about it twice before coming to this location.', 'I have been to many TeX Mex places in my life and was really disappointed in the place. The service was really bad and the did was mediocre bland and not worth trying out. I gave them one star but will not go back.', 'Slowest service I have ever received in my life. Lunch took over two hours and was just ok. I will never return. It was raining so we picked a restaurant quickly. It was not busy, not another table was seated in our room. No music and our server took forever for everything, menus-15 minutes, drinks-20 minutes, food-30 more minutes, no refills, and it took forever for the check. We left cash because we were afraid to give a cc because it would have taken another 30 minutes to get it back. Skip this place!!', 'So it\\'s 6:30 pm and all flights at the airport are delayed due to weather. This pizza place is right in the middle of the terminal so it\\'s a good place to grab a bite. Here\\'s the problem. They have no food! I ordered a salad and was told \"we are all out of salads\", then I ordered a slice of margarita pizza and was told that all that is available is pepperoni or cheese. The lady behind me wanted garlic knots, they were out. The place was empty at first so it\\'s not like they sold out. They just didn\\'t stock well. They have one kid working there and he makes one pizza at a time. Don\\'t have a menu up if only 2 of the 11 items are offered! The pizza was fine but it was really a strange experience.', \"Chili was watery with grissley meat.  Sent back and exchanged for chicken tortilla. Ice in soda was mildew.  Asked for manager and he said he couldn't smell the mildew. Baloney.  The ice was contaminated.  Don't eat here!!!!\", \"Rude, inattentive, uneducated and they always make you feel that you are bothering them. I have started using mobile order because it's one less idiot to deal within the chain. When they start making $15 an hour we will be ordering from kiosks and maybe dealing with one person.\", 'Not worth the 50% off. I knew I had a bad feeling the second I walked in. The restaurant was a bit too hot for a sushi bar with fish sitting there behind the un-refrigerated glass all day. I should have listened to my gut but I made a huge mistake. I ended up getting so sick! Some of the worst sushi I have ever had, horrible service, and less than 1 star quality food.', 'Horrible customer service. Major attitude problem. Been to many Starbucks in US and in other countries definitely do not follow the Starbucks great customer service model.', \"Place is horrible. They make it look on the website like it is a made to order deli but we disappointed to find this morning that it's actually just a couple day old sandwiches in a refrigerator and a bunch of random other crap. On top of that the sandwich was ass.\", \"I'm not going to be returning to Santa Fe for a while. I just didn't like it, flat out. I've been before for chips and salsa and margaritas, and that was just ok, but I went recently for a full meal and I just cannot get past the fact that the tuna on my yellowtail tostada was cooked hopefully that morning or maybe even the day before, but it was not fresh. It had a congealed coat on the outside of it and it was cold, so I know it came from the fridge. The salad it sat on, iceberg, was so ordinary, it completely downgraded the dish. Haven't they discovered the beauty of baby mixed greens, they are pretty and make every salad seem a lot classier. The best part of the meal were the chips and salsa. Kind of sad really. In my opinion, fresh is always better and when it comes to fish, fresh should be the only option!!!\", 'Inspect your food before you put it in your mouth! Ordered the Spicy Tuna Roll last night and am now battling the worst case of food poisoning the world has ever known - think projectile vomiting- . The tuna was mushy and the color was too dark, like it had been sitting out at room temperature all day. This place needs to be inspected. Avoid this place.', 'This is not an authentic sushi place.  If you are going to order spicy tuna and salmon then this the places for you, else wait for dinner and head over to Double Knot', \"For a long time as a Chinese foodie my family loved going to Han Dynasty. \\nBut we went there for my birthday last week and the food was horrible. The string beans were fried in stale tasting oil and the boss won't admit it had a bad taste to it. The walnut sprimp that we ordered were fried in extra thick batter. the small sprimp turned into a fat corn dog looking thing. Our last dish, orange beef was also covered in thick breading, beef was not tender, hard to chew and it had crazy amount of glaze glob on it. Horrible Horrible...I was super disappointed after wanting to visit there for a while. Dont waste your money. This is not how Chinese food should taste like!\", 'Find another pharmacy!\\n\\nI have had bad experience after bad experience at this pharmacy.  First, they are incredibly slow.  There\\'s often a long line of cars at the drive through window.  Even when there are no customers at the pharmacy counter inside, they seem to take a break between cars, making everyone wait for no reason whatsoever.\\n\\nRecently, I went to pick up a prescription I have been taking for years.  After I paid, but before she handed me my medicine, the woman told me I had to wait and talk to the pharmacist.  I explained that I had the flu and that I had been taking that medication at that dosage for years and I really didn\\'t want to wait for the pharmacist.  I just wanted to get home before I threw up again.  She told me it would be illegal for her to give me the medicine without talking to the pharmacist.  That is a bold faced lie.  It may violate Walgreens\\'s policy, but it is not illegal.  Ask an attorney or any non-Walgreens pharmacy.\\n\\nFinally, I was prescribed two medicines that cannot be taken together.  This Walgreens filled both prescriptions, repeatedly.  When I found out about the potentially deadly interaction between the two medicines, I pointed it out to the pharmacist very politely.  First, he had no idea those medicines were contraindicated.  Second, he acted like it was no big deal at all.  He never said sorry or we\\'ll look into it or anything.  He just said something like, \"So you want me to take X medication off automatic refill?\"  I was shocked.  I left a message for Walgreens to complain about that issue, but I never got a return call.\\n\\nTime to find another pharmacy.', \"1. Bad service\\n- all the waitresses were congregating by the cash register. not minding the place\\n- food came out but we weren't asked what condiments we wanted nor were we provided any eating utensils. I guess it's a self service kinda place.\\n\\n2. Bad food\\n- old cold fries\\n- unseasoned and overcooked burger. buns weren't even  toasted.\\n\\nDon't go there for food.\", 'I work in many areas throughout the Tampabay area!  Today I happened upon this beautiful \"old friend\" and was thrilled to see it still standing and doing business!!!  I was pleasantly surprised as I walked through the main doors and found it to be just as it was but actually even more beautiful!!!  I was in a hurry to meet a client so I decided I was going to place a to go order...:I asked the hostess for a to go order menu and she handed me one and then as I was looking over the menu I expressed my excitement for this place that I once loved so long ago!!!!  She said and I quote \"ARE YOU GOING TO PLACE A TO GO ORDER OR NOT?\"  I very nicely handed the menu back to her and turned and left the restaurant!!!!!  Wow!!!!!!!!', 'I constantly go to coffee shops to study and I am obsessed with teas and latte art. I\\'m a huge fan of savory cafe and I just tried coffee cat for the first time today. I\\'ve been to French press countless times with friends and today completely changed my opinion. I\\'ve been sitting here for twenty minutes lost in homework planning on being here for way too long to write several essays and order numerous drinks. However I didn\\'t feel like getting one the second I sat down. One of the baristas just came up to me and basically accused me of not getting a drink. Our conversion, \"did we get you a drink\" \"no I haven\\'t ordered one yet\" \"are you going to\" \"yes, in do time\" \"thanks\" Do I have to order one the second I get here?!?! It\\'s not like I look fucking homeless here with my Mac and nice clothes. Actually baffled hahaha I wish I wasn\\'t so pleasant when she spoke with me. What\\'s up with the fact that they don\\'t have green tea matcha powder? Their coffee is good I\\'ll give them that, but maybe they need to weave out some of the rude people who work here. Pitty. I\\'m a loyal customer.', 'Kinda a dive bar but could have been cool.  We found the girl bartender to be pretentious and rude.  All she seemed to care about is rushing through our order so she could go back and talk to her friends and giving smart ass answers every time you asked her a question.', \"OK, I'm going to be Debbie Downer.\\n\\nAwful coffee. Just awful.\\n\\nMaybe that's not fair. I have yet to sample all of their fare, and perhaps it's a bad idea to fit them into the mold that Mugshots (which was gone before I arrived in Manayunk) occupied. But in the end, they call themselves a cafe, which translates into a coffee shop, moved into the location of a former coffee shop and they include baked goods and coffee on the menu, so I feel comfortable in holding them to some standard.\\n\\nThey were out of their banana bread. All of it. For all the flavors they described, they didn't have a single one left when I arrived. This is a significant portion of their menu, and they were out of all of it, which tells me that they have problems with keeping things in stock They had plenty of Baklava, but I'm allergic to two of the nuts they use in them, so even experimenting is a horrible idea.\\n\\nThere was a small child running around screaming, and I could hear arguing breaking out as I stepped through the door with my coffee. I'm not saying that without empathy, but that is never something you want your customers getting to be a part of. Even if the food had been perfect, it would have detracted from the experience\\n\\nAnd...the coffee...I have to  go back to that. I really do. If I has handed a mug of Starbucks and was told that someone had urinated in it, and my only other option was what I had here...I would seriously have to debate that decision. This is a horrible thing to say. It's cruel, and cruel honestly isn't that much more helpful than well meaning lies. It's even more horrible to look at in the cold light of day, and determine that it's still a correct assessment. But this is someone who, during his broke college days, would drink coffee through day old grounds. Someone who used an abandoned French press that was held together with duct tape, and I couldn't finish it. Seriously, it was that bad. I don't know how they did it, and that cup was an accomplishment in of itself.\\n\\nMaybe the owners are nice folk. Maybe, their Mediterranean food is really good, as other reviews seem to indicate. But they sure as shit ain't a cafe. If they want to be cheery, and have great falafel, they should do that. But dear God in heaven, who I have forsaken in so many ways, they put something on the menu so bad I am still  shocked. Combined with a lack of stock and that atmosphere, I can't possibly give this place a good rating.\", 'As someone from out of town, all I could look forward to was the food. And let me tell you it was a disappointment. I read many good reviews about this establishment. If I could give them no stars I would. Could not run out of there fast enough. Their half peeled shrimp was literal mush. They had absolutely no flavor whatsoever. The shrimp peel was brown, they were probably cooked about a month ago, put in a freezer and served them to me as they thawed. Their jambalaya was further than the truth. It was pasta in tomato sauce with a minuscule piece of chicken. And the fact that I had to pay as I left was bewildering. Not even their mediocre waiters could save, what I would call, the worst dining experience of my life. The only thing that made it worthwhile was when the hostess removed the atrocity that was my dinner and asked \"they nasty?\"', 'Once again I tried this place because my wife liked it. Semi good food but very poor service. Where do they get some of these waitresses? Our waitress with a long braided blonde ponytail could only walk by us flirting with another waiter. She never even asked us anything until we were ready to leave. Very disappointed once again!!!', 'So disappointing. Stopped by for the first time Friday night.  There were 3 people at the bar. The rest of the place was empty.  Sat down, no acknowledgement from the staff.  Went up to the bar and took a menu, still no acknowledgement from the staff.  The guy behind the bar walked right past us to get a bottle of wine for the people at the bar, still no acknowledgement.  Finally after 15 minutes of being invisible, we walked out, and still no acknowledgement. We are new to the neighborhood and are wine drinkers.  We really wanted this to be our new hangout. However, we will look for a place that wants to provide service, where we are happy to spend our money.', 'Walked in, excited to try the burger and tots. Small place but, 3 tables open. We sat down and were ignored Until mgr came over to ask if our name was on the waiting list, we said we passed the hostess and she didnt asked us for our name for waiting list. He said people were waiting, meanwhile, no visable people in cue to sit! He told us to get up and wait in a corner near the bar! We left! We had just been in a large group who dropped $$$$ on drinks, snacks at the sister restaurant Tinto next door too. Rude!', \"I went to Fez with my family and we were pretty excited to eat some good Moroccon food! However, it was a horrible experience.\\n1) food was below average.\\n2) overpriced for very small portions\\n3) slow service\\n4) I was surprised for the price they didn't even serve  free pita/ appetizer or Moroccan tea/coffee \\n\\n\\n The only good thing was the ambience and that's it! \\nWouldn't recommend it and wouldn't go back!\", 'Incredibly unfriendly staff. The place a filthy disaster. Dirty dishes all over the place. Trash bags sitting out like someone attempted to change the trash. They were out of many things at the drink area (lids, napkins). Used the lack of a cook as an excuse for all their issues but positioned it as an inconvenience to them and not apologetic to customers at all.', \"WARNING: HORRIBLE!\\n\\nI absolutely love BBQ and southern food. With that said my family and I decide to try this place for take out since it was brand new. First of all, there is a $3 charge for any order over $40 which isnt that bad but you would figure the there wouldn't be a charge for large orders since we're spending a lot. \\n\\nNever the less we took our dinner home excited for our new found BBQ place. We got a half slab, a chicken crisper and rib platter, a brisket platter, and a Tennessee triple platter. Starting with the slab, unbelievably dry and the sauce was ketchup with Worcestershire sauce. They have this coating that I've never seen and I'm assuming it's because they were smoked, however it made eating them almost impossible. The chicken was dry and had gristle which was surprising since it was pulled. The sauce again, ketchup and Worcestershire. The brisket...the worst I've ever had. \\n\\nBesides the horrible food, I've never been to a BBQ place that didn't serve Mac and cheese. One star and I will never give my business to this place again.\", 'The food is barely edible. Got goat biryani and goat curry. The Goat meat was tough and full of gristle. The biryani left a lot to be desired.  There are several places in Delaware that have far better tasting biryani.  Being a to go place service is non existant.', \"horrible food! waited for my nachos that took forever!!!! when they came they were freezing cold even the chips highly disappointed wish i could've given them  no stars they do not deserve any of my stars\", \"This restaurant was the worst experience that I've had in Indianapolis to date. A coworker and I decided to go to lunch today at a Mexican restaurant that she recommend it. It was my first mind to go somewhere else but I decided to try something new and Yelp something different for a change. Mistake! \\n\\nUpon entering we saw the sign for the lunch special wish we were both excited about, hey $5.99! We sat down and the waitress seemed friendly. She showed us the lunch menu. I decided to get the taco special and 1 chicken tamale to try (im still seachung for great tamales). Of course like a few other places that I have been too lately, my waitress comes from the kitchen to announce no tamles are ready for today.  Interesting because it's noon and you don't have my ready but you opened at 11am... #ICant\\n\\nI let it go (and took off a star), getting ready for my  taco lunch with onions and cilantro extra cheese. It came out in due time  only to find out I was not very happy with the food at all. Actually took me a little while to eat my second taco. The positive thing about the meal was the portions. The two tacos were large. It just did not taste like authentic Mexican tacos. It tastes like something that I could easily make at home. American best-try kind-of tacos. Another star gone. \\n\\nWe ready to go soon enough and we ask for separate check which the waiter said that she could do. However she did not bring out separate checks. In fact my coworker had to ask how much her meal was. The waitress had to go back and count up for her total and then come back and tell her how much the her portion was. Well knowing that I only spent about $7 in the restaurant I did not think I needed to do the same. Mistake. I was very surprised when found out my meal was almost $11 when my card was ran. Apparently it was extra for the cilantro onion even know the meal came with tomatoes and lettuce which I asked for instead. Never was told it was extra. I knew I had to pay for extra chees, but dang!  Management came out upon my request to give me a breakdown of the bill, especially since I couldn't get itemized bill. I was not happy, not buying the explaination, nor impressed. They give me a small, change of a refund and vowed to NEVER be back. \\n\\nNo tamales, no detailed bill, no prior knowledge of changes would be extra, food not great at all... Yeah, you have ok decor and yes you smiled but service is lacking, never again. #EpicEpicEpicFail\", 'Went here this Friday and had Rendang. Okay food (worth the price). Horrible service. Servers took turn to rush us by constantly asking if we were finished while we clearly were not. When we were done, we had separate checks. One friend tipped 10% for it and had a female server chased us down outside and COMMANDED (exact words: \"COME HERE!\" with a frown on her face) my friend to come back inside and QUESTIONED her with rudeness why she didn\\'t tip 15%. My friend who used to work at a country club didn\\'t even bother to explain to her what is actual serving. By this time, I was truly regretful for tipping at all. Don\\'t get me wrong, the food is not bad, but not worth the service that we had. We would never visit this place again.', 'Had a great meal. Sat in the bar. About half way through the meal, someone in the kitchen turned on VERY LOUD RAP MUSIC.  Sorry , but it was extremely irritating hearing loud rap music and the music in the restaurant. REALLY? Do you have to have this music while cooking. Your not at home. You are at a business. I was it the Greenwood/ county line store', \"We had already spend a long while walking around through the parade and wanted to kill time before we got oysters. We were waiting for the line to die down at two other places but came across Creole House on the way to French quarter. The line was short and it was only a 20 minute wait. I am an oyster fiend. Living in NYC I got oysters every other night enjoying 2-3 dozens by myself. Thinking the oysters would be delicious , I ordered 2 dozens and so did my sister. We also shared a cup of gumbo. My sisters friend had a shrimp po boy with fries. After half a dozen oysters I started to feel nauseous. I didn't want to waste any oysters so I suffered though the first dozen. My sister has a strong stomach and finish 1.5 dozen. I couldn't eat anymore. The gumbo was terrible. It had no flavor, it was so tiny for 7 dollars(we had way better gumbo at another place the day after for way less). We had a taste of the po boy as well. It was just ok. My sisters friend didn't finish it either. The fries came fresh out the freezer I'm sure. Dry and scrawny little things. Should've just gone to French quarter and ate at one of the other places. Probably would've been better since the lines were longer. Would've been worth the wait. What a waste of money. And stomach space.\", 'I\\'ve been here a handful of times, and bagels have always been delicious. I visited the shop on 5/19/18, and this will be my last visit. I went there because I was hungry and in need of food, but it seemed like I walked into the middle of classic P.T. Barnum show: clowns juggling while riding unicycles and elephants parading around on their hind legs. The first employee I interacted with, at the \"bulk\" bagel counter, didn\\'t hesitate to let me know that I was attempting to order from the wrong location. Fair enough. They did have a sign on the counter, but it wasn\\'t as conspicuous as an \"order here\" sign that dangles from the ceiling. Her tone made it clear to me that I had already committed one transgression. I then order from the attendant at the POS. I clarified my complicated order of a breakfast sandwich and two toasted everything bagels with a tomato and garlic cream cheese, three times. The first clarification was that I wanted everything bagels, not plain. The second  clarification was directed toward me because they actually have garlic and herb cream cheese, not garlic cream cheese. The third was my reiteration of the tomato and the quantity of the said bagels. At this point I had more confidence in a drunk ESL Uber driver getting me home safely than my order being prepared as per my request. After waiting for my extravagant order to be prepared to imperfection and gazing at the yellow ceiling grid with stalactites of black dust, my name was called and the first employee I interacted with hastily handed me my bagel bag. On the ride home I asked my partner in crime to ensure that there were 3 bagels in the bag because they probably \"F-ed\" the order up. He assured me that the quantity was correct. When I got home, I feverishly ripped open the wrapping on the two everything bagels, like a joyous child on Christmas Day, only to find     that the bagels had the tomatoes omitted and the cream cheese barely exceeded a skim coat. The breakfast sandwich was anemic at best with barely any protein on it. I am so glad that I expected disappointment. Honestly I\\'m not too upset because closer to my house there is a new bagel shop: Red House bagels, where the staff is courteous, the shop is cleaner, and the bagels a bit larger. Red House is my new bagel stop.  Sorry Newtown Bagel Co, you\\'ve been replaced. Although your actual bagels are slightly better tasting, it is not enough to reconcile the pain points associated with your operations. My words of advice, replace (don\\'t clean) your ceiling tiles and clean the filth from the grid. Having almost 10 years of food and beverage experience, I would hate to see what your walk-in and floors behind the counter look like. Coach your employees on courteous service, or maybe treat them better and they might pass that on to your patrons. Oh and maybe write the orders down before entering them into the POS, because sometimes those machines aren\\'t as navigable for some operators. I\\'d like to keep going on about this, but I am probably beating an already abused P.T. Barnum animal.', 'im a frequent backyard bowls customer and usually disregard if they make one mistake but this time was different. it started off by them not answering the phone when i called so i resulted in making an online order. i made my usual modifications, nothing major, no banana sub strawberries, no honey sub agave. plain and simple. i was greeted by a guy who fumbled in the fridge to find my order until he realized it was barely getting made. one of the employees was glaring at me and when it was his turn to put the toppings on he sloppily cut strawberries- stems still attached and not even sliced (no big deal im not that picky). he yelled my name for the order even though i was standing two feet away and he knew it was mine? i asked for agave, he rolled his eyes, and barely put any on top. I get back to my car and realize that he forgot the blueberries, kiwi, and 80% of the agave. called back to let them know the customer service was horrible and that my toppings were forgotten and was simply told \"uhhhhh okay\". i immediately hung up after i heard no apology whatsoever.', \"We made reservations, and were seated upstairs about a foot from the band at a table that seemed more like a bar table. After sitting for 45 min with NO SERVICE, just empty glasses and silverware, we left. While leaving the host kindly insisted to grab the manager after we told her what happened. (The hosts were wonderful!)   The manager did nothing besides essentially say that this wasn't typical and to come back.\", 'Heed the warnings. Long lines, poor service, HORRIBLE food. I\\'m sorry, but everything we were served was just nasty. We had a 3 hour layover and I neglected to look at the reviews prior to us getting a table.\\n\\nWe passed by several tables on our way to our seats and everyone\\'s food looked straight nasty. But we stuck it out and went on and ordered anyway. We started with some cheese sticks. These were so gross. When they arrived on our table, they were soaked with some kind of weird brown juice. I assume it was the oil they were fried in that looked like it was last changed prior to the Exxon-Valdez oil spill back in \\'89. Horrible, burnt, greasy, and very \"off\" flavor. Our table mate next to us ordered the ravioli bites, they were also covered in the brown oil grease and they didn\\'t even eat 1/2 of them.\\n\\nOur pasta dishes were equally as disappointing and gross. I opted for the lasagna, and it was NASTY. The pasta itself was overcooked, which I can live with if bolstered by a decent sauce, quality/fresh meat, and good cheese. This lasagna offered NONE of these things. The sauce was the worst offender. Packed with sugar, it was a VERY SWEET, very thin red/marinara sauce. There were no spices or typical Italian seasonings, no garlic, no onion flavor, none of the deep, rich flavors that typically adorn good Italian-style food. The cheese was cheap and rubbery, and there was NO MEAT in the lasagna to speak of. Literally, I had NONE in my dish. It was absent, and sorely needed.\\n\\nDO NOT EAT HERE. You WILL regret it.', 'never get take-out from this place ever unless you want to eat your lunch at dinner time.  Not only did it take almost 2 hours to get the food delivered but we were told a half an hour after we placed the order that it was on the grill(he called back because of credit card issues.)  I will never get anything from this place again.', \"I know that Pi is a popular place, and that it gets packed in the loop, especially on Friday and Saturday nights.  Since they don't take reservations for 2 people, and being the smart yelper that I am, I called first to check on the wait.  They said that by the time I came in, there would be no wait, especially because the concert at the Pageant was about to start.  So the bf and I headed down there 10 min later, and he dropped me off so I wouldn't have to walk in the cold (what a gentleman).  I walked in, and the snooty hostesses told me there was a 40 min wait.  Um there is NO WAY all of those people just showed up in 10 min.  Clearly someone fudged the truth to get me to come in.  And there wasn't a single seat or place to stand in the bar or the tiny waiting area.  I tried to call him to tell him not to park and walk down (he would probably have to walk pretty far) but he wasn't paying attention to his phone, so he never got the message.   He walked in, took one look, and I knew we were both on the same page.  I politely told the hostesses that they could cross off our name, and then waited by the door while he pulled the car around.  They proceeded to stare at me very obviously and whisper during this time, until I left, which  is bad business, whether you're a catty hostess that still thinks she is in high school (or maybe still is), or a hostess raving about how fabulous my outfit is.  Either way girls, it's rude.\\n\\nDon't get me wrong...the pizza here is good.  But it's no mystic pizza.  And it isn't the only pizza place around.  This story has a happy ending though.  We went to Dewey's, were promptly seated, experienced the best service there, as we always do, and left with full bellies, probably way before we would've even gotten our pizza at Pi. \\n\\nNever again.\", \"Terrible service. Went at 1pm on a Saturday and waited 25 minutes for my order (there were 2 ppl ahead of me with normal, single sandwich orders). First, the guy didn't know how to make my sandwich (a black forest ham) and skipped to the next guy in line until he could get the girl in the back to come make it, leaving me just standing there getting passed over in line. He then put the condiments on and put on an insane amount of mustard. I didn't ask for extra, I just said mustard, thinking he'd run it back and forth 2 or 3 times and that's it. Nope, he squeezed the crap out of the bottle and completely drenched it. Then he can't work the cash register, only the girl can. Just one thing after another.  \\n\\nI then go out front to eat and hear a car at the drive thru placing an order on the touch screen kiosk (which is actually a really good idea), but the girl inside is telling them over the mic they have to come inside to order, that they can't place there order in the drive thru. Employees at this location seriously need some training or help. Go to another location if you can.\", \"Nope nope and nope again\\nRude hostess \\nAlways some nonesense with seating and sushi is mediocre at best... \\nyes it's dirt cheap but it's also dirt food & dirt service \\nOh the kicker - ginger smells like amonia\\nGave this place a couple tries \\nNever again\", \"Abysmal customer service. Came in on Wednesday at 6ish (not busy), ordered a meatball sub from some short white dude. He insisted that meatball subs only get three meatballs and when I challenged him and inquired as to why that was he got very rude very quickly. As my sub was in the oven I decided to look up subway's website and, lo and behold, meatball subs DO get four meatballs, just like every other time I have gotten a sub from that store. When I informed him of this and asked for another meatball he stomped over, smashed two more meatballs into my sandwich, and snippily finished the order even after I informed him I didn't want to cause any trouble.\\n\\nThere are some wonderful people who work at this Subway. That guy was not one of them and the experience was enough to put me off that store completely. I'm not expecting five star service from a Subway but when you try to take advantage of your customers and then get angry when they call you out on it, maybe you aren't meant for a job that involves customer interaction. Will not be returning to this store ever again.\", 'My girlfriend and I decided to try Kalamata\\'s last night at around 7:30. The guy at the counter asked us if we\\'re ready to order even before we had the chance to look at the menu properly, not once but multiple times. \\n\\nWe ordered 2 lamb gyros, a side order of roasted potatoes and the tabouleh. The potatoes came out extremely fast and were lukewarm at best. Either they were premade, and \"microwaved to order\" or were just sitting on a hot plate. Not something I\\'d expect from any restaurant. \\n\\nThe tabouleh was SOUR - like salad dunked in a bottle of fish sauce sour. We decided to tell the guy upfront our issues with the tabouleh but all we got out of him was \"This is our recipe. This is the way we make it. It\\'s fine if you don\\'t like it, but this is how we make it\". I agree I have no idea what authentic tabouleh tastes like, or how to make it, but I have tasted GOOD tabouleh in the past, and this was far from it. I pity the people who\\'ve eaten tabouleh only at this establishment because they\\'re really missing out. \\n\\nThe gyros were pedestrian at best, under-seasoned and most of all under-sauced. The veggies were on one side of the pita, the meat on the other - so you\\'d never get a mouthful of veggies+meat and only one side of the pocket had the sauce. Suspecting another \"This is how we sauce our gyros. This is our recipe\" moment, we decided to finish our food ASAP.\\n\\nFinally, the worst offense was that the guy starts closing up shop while we\\'re still eating. Really? I\\'ve no idea how this place got 4 stars on yelp, but there are way better restaurants in Nashville for Mediterranean food.', \"This Mcdonalds has poor management. Went there once and they informed us they were out of straws. Another time The shake machine for st pattys shakes was down and they didn't know when it would be up. Went there 2 weeks later and it was still down. Went there once for take home and when we got home there was no hamburger in the buns. Just a bun with pickles, tomatoes, and lettuce. Finally I got the message that these people did not care about their customers and stop going there.\", \"Short and sweet - Been here three times and haven't been impressed. This last time I called in an order. The guy taking my order was rude and not helpful. I don't know the menu and asked him some questions and he knew about as much as I did. When arriving to pick up. Had to look for service. Was surprised by the 27$ bill for one entree. Got home, missing salad, over cooked steak, over cooked fries. Never again. Hope not everyone has that experience! Good luck. \\n\\nP.S bring your cash cow. This place is PRICY especially for the quality of food\", \"We ate here tonight.

This particular location was terrible.   We ordered ahead and first of all the order was wrong.   And may I ask how does a Mexican restaurant run out of guacamole??   and run out of taco shells?  and run out of the pepper and onion stir fry mix?   Also, the service was very slow.   The food was thrown together and not in the usual way.    My son called to tell them about the order when he got home, and the person on the phone didn't care.

Been sitting in the drive-thru for 10 minutes only to be told the item I wanted isn't offered anymore, even though commercials are still playing for it.

Lesson learned the hard way. Never in my life have I been more disgusted with customer service, this establishment doesnt even deserve one star. As a professional event planner, I am very organized and always check my reservations. I have been planning my best friends bachelorette party since April, and booked online in advance. I called several times prior to our trip to assure it was okay that a seperate credit card holder reserved the room, and we paid with a deperate one.\\n\\nI had guests arriving from all over, some drove 10+ hours and when they arrived, were not able to check in. They were refused to it being under a different name, even though I confirmed this was okay prior to arriving. They needed the confirmation number, but the one THEY SENT ME (email proof) was not working. I called the front desk while still en route to Nashville to let them know guests were waiting, and BOTH women were extremely rude and condescending. My guests had to wait an hour before getting a room.\\n\\nWe arrived at 4pm and had a tight schedule as we had activites starting at 5:30. We were supposed to go in, decorate for the celebration, get ready and leave. This was not the case. Upon checking in, I am told that they preauthorize the card AT CHECKIN, even though I confirmed several times over the phone that the card was just to reserve the room and we could pay at check out with our choice of payment. We had girls from all over the country coming that were bringing money towards the room, and it was to be deposited before checkout. We did not have time to go to the bank before our paid for, scheduled activities and the only offer they gave us was to preauthorize half of the amount one night until we get the rest tomorrow. At this point we are already late and not ready for our outing due to their poor communication, and it ruined our other experiences as well.\\n\\nThe fun doesnt stop there....we paid for a junior sweet with a sofa and a chair, two beds, and paid extra for a pull out bed. Upon FINALLY getting into our room, there is no extra bed, and not a sofa, but two chairs. This was crucial to our sleeping arrangments, and was all requeated and confirmed prior to arrival. We also requested it when they gave us a room key, and now its 12 oclock at night and we have one pull out sofa and they are still giving us a hard time about the sofa. If we could, wed pack and leave immediately but this is a once in a life time thing for my best friend, so were stuck here.

When my order arrived the coleslaw was missing, the middle piece of bread was in it, not big deal I can take that out. The big deal was it was toasted. I called, and they offered to give me a free sandwich on a future order. Today I placed my order at 12:08. I called at 1:07 to find out where my lunch was. The lady told me it was made and sitting there. What the hell you leave a sandwich sitting there for an hour? Apparently they only have two drivers on today.

It was a highly recommended local breakfast place. Located far from the touristy French quarters, it's a small shack-dive beloved by locals and tourists as the best in local cuisine. Even before we got there, we saw a crowd of people waiting outside. The wait for a table was 30 minutes so we felt lucky and elated to sit at the bar. We got a watermelon and jicama salad and a crabmeat omelet. I was disappointment from the first bite. The omelet was soooo rich, like it was made with cream and butter and more butter-cream on top; it made me nauseous. The salad was so plain, it felt like a joke, a few pieces of watermelon on ripped up leaves of bibb lettuce  covered with black pepper. I needed to eat something and asked for a garden salad with a poached egg. It was a poor showing with some mixed greens, a pathetically thin slice of tomato, a few cubes of huge cucumbers used for juicing and a balsamic vinaigrette mixed by finger right in front of me. The place is a tiny shack, should be filled with lovingly prepared local cuisine. It is NOT. The food, as well as the service and the ambiance are a poor showing, more hype than substance. The supposedly organic fresh juices, at $7 a pop, are not squeezed to order but poured from containers from the fridge. Freshly squeezed should be freshly squeezed. They refused to give us water with ice. How can you not give people water when its so unbearable hot outside? We paid more for our breakfast than a top French restaurant in New York and I walked away hungry and disgusted.\", 'I just called to place a delivery order and they stated they could not do it.

I was eating in the home office and bit into quite a few cold chicken pieces. I ate around the chicken as I have an unnatural fear of food poisoning.

I went to go check on my husband in the living room and he stopped eating all together. Half way through his burrito, he found a 4 or so inch long brown hair. Yay for finding hair in your food!

Plus our roast beef sammy was way overcooked and dry... and missing the \"everything\" we asked for (lettuce, onion, pickle, tomato, mayo).\\n\\nSo we called back and explained the situation and they promised to send the remake out RIGHT AWAY. lol.... another hour later we got a nice looking roast beef sammy but a pizza that was even MORE jacked!

Let me send you a text image of this pizza- it is crazy.\" He apologized profusely and promised to send another, but at this point it had been 2 hours and we had drank our sodas, and eaten our wings and had dinner plans so we refused another pizza. \\n\\nAt this point, the gentleman offered to bring us back our ten dolllars for the pizza and we accepted. He said he\\'d be by shortly but it was another hour before we saw him.\\n\\nTotal s-show. Avoid this location altogether. I have had far superior service at the U City or Maplewood locations. YIKES', 'I\\'ve been 3 times, so I think I can share a fair judgement.  This business is a lot of show, without the go.   Service has been the overall department that has been completely lacking along with some breakfast items are products of horrible cooking.  First time: asked for black coffee and a matcha latte, dad didn\\'t get his coffee until our food already arrived (which also seemed to take forever) and I actually never received my matcha latte after asking and reminding waiters more than eight times, 8!!! It got to be comical, which is why we counted.  By the end of our breakfast they finally offered it to me in it as a to go drink and still had the audacity to charge me for it, so I said no.  Second visit, was dinner with friends, this was a much more pleasant experience, there was four of us, we shared a bottle of wine and I remember I liked my food. No complaints here. Third time, was another breakfast round... I\\'m not sure what it is about breakfast but I don\\'t think they do a good job for breakfast. To start with, we were given menus for both breakfast and lunch, which was appreciated, but no drink menus and we were specifically interested in mimosas or Bloody Mary\\'s etc. because we didn\\'t know what to order, or what was our options were... my dad ordered a Bloody Mary, and I ordered a Mimosa. I only mention this because it was frustrating to see other people have different variations of mimosas and also bloody mary\\'s, other breakfast cocktails which we didn\\'t even know existed.  My dad ordered a ham and cheese omelette with his side of home fries. I ordered the power bowl muesli.  We got through two drinks before the food came, which actually was a long time. By the time our food came, the order was wrong - my dad had fruit, but no home fries as he requested.  We immediately let our server know, and she said she would go grab them.  Additionally, our plates were extremely bland.  Just an omelette, no garnish or sides at all (other than the fruit in the side bowl.  The plates just looked sad.  Also, I could tell by looking at the omelette it wasn\\'t good, that\\'s how bad it was, and my dad concurred.  The wait staff failed to bring his home fries in any kind of fast or quick manner, so we reminded our bartender, who then reminded to server, once my dad got a refill on his coffee we also then reminded that server as well.  We ate through the entire meal, never got the home fries, and in the end right as our check was being delivered we mentioned the homefries again, and that\\'s when the bartender sent a server running for them, and as we were signing our check is when they came out and were offered as a \"to go\" option.  While a simple side, it was really disappointing to go the entire breakfast with an awkward feeling of  \"I guess they just don\\'t care\" and instead of comping anything, the manager offered me a $15 off coupon the next time we came in.  It\\'s just hard to ever want to come in again... and didn\\'t feel like an adequate apology on a $45 breakfast.  And lastly my dads omelette tasted like McDonalds.  Only upside was that my muesli power bowl was delicious, just hard to believe it took as long as it did to come out or that anything cost as much as it did with as horrible of service and lack of \"care\" put behind anything that was done there.', \"DISCLAIMER: this review is limited exclusively to my single experience last night eating prawn mee noodle soup at Penang.\\n\\nReview: this dish was admittedly very fishy, which I was generally okay with. It almost tasted like the restaurant added fermented shrimp paste or something similar. That's also not an issue, in itself.

I decided to give them another chance because I was hungry and had a credit. I call and am greeted by a young woman who informed me that I had two people waiting before me and asked me to hold. She proceeded to place me on hold before I could even respond. I held for about 3 minutes before she picked up. I placed my order and then explained that I had a credit. She stated she would need to look in \"the book\" for my credit. Another two minutes of waiting and surprise, she can\\'t locate my credit. I ask to speak to a manager, and she says that the manager is out doing deliveries. Seriously...wth? She tells me I can call back later. Umm no, I\\'m hungry now.\\n\\nI ended up canceling my order. This place is beyond ratchet and I will never order from them again. The food at Bruno\\'s and Bally\\'s is much better...so is their level of cleanliness and customer service.', \"I haven't eaten here in a while because a friend of mines quit, due to rude employers. But I was just starving. I went to order an omelette with the veggies wrapped inside instead of cooked in. I was told that I could not have it that way. Once I asked why??? Both cashiers snapped at me and told me that the cook had the right to make it however he pleased and couldn't I see how busy they were. And they didn't have anytime to special make my order.... After a verbal argument between me and the staff the had to nerve to ask if I still wanted to order. This place has good food but very very poor customer service skills. I will never spend my money there ever again... The worst service I have ever received.\", \"Someone needs to find out who's in charge of greeting diners as they walk in to this place. I stood for almost 10 minutes as 2 employees failed to show me to a table. The first employee to see me hardly even glanced at me, let alone attempt to greet me. He was seating 2 ladies just as I walked in so I assumed he would be right back to seat me. Bad assumption. Luckily, there was a second employee serving a table nearby who asked if I had been taken care of yet. When I told her I had not, she disappeared for a minute, only to return to reassure me that it would only be a couple of minutes longer for me to wait to be seated, presumably not by her since she was roaming around in plain sight the whole time. 5 or more minutes of standing alone in the entrance way later, I walk up to the outdoor seating area and find the first employee opening a bottle of wine at a table. After seeing him glance at me out of the corner of his eye, and still not even making eye contact or asking me what he could do for me, I stand and stare for a minute while he works, only to find that second reassuring employee finally peek through and open the door. She proceeds to ask me IF I would like to be seated. Now from where I'm standing it should have been abundantly obvious that I was waiting to be seated, but rather than admit an error on their part, she would have me believe she wasn't sure. Now I don't believe either of them meant any malice towards me, but first of all the assumption should be that someone standing with their arms crossed in the entrance should be waiting to be seated, unless they've said otherwise, and in any case shouldn't they be asked? If there were a host stationed at that entrance this could have been avoided, but as it went, no one knew that I wasn't being served and no one did enough to try and find that out. ~feeling let down.\", 'Could not get service. I was pass over service twice for customers that ordered was taken immediately after being seated. When I bought to the hostess, that I was at lunch and was pass over. She told that I would have to wait because they was busy.', \"Probably an amazing bar- I typically LOVE Margaritaville bars, but the security guard here was SO rude and SO disrespectful, even to those doing exactly what he asked. He put a huge damper on the day and the fun of the event.

I ordered , paid for it and went home . Those were the worst tacos of my life, this is sad day. My stomach still hurts from the pain I felt and the disappointment.

Poor management or lack thereof!', \"We came here for the first time on a slow Sunday morning but didn't even get to eat. We came for breakfast and waited in line to order for a few minutes. The people in front of us ordered breakfast. Next, when it was our turn, the girl at the counter informed us they do not serve breakfast after 10:30. We looked at the time and it was 10:30 ON THE NOSE. Since breakfast was what we came for, we left. It doesn't seem like they should have had to be so steadfast about their cutoff time. If it was 10:35, I would understand it, or if we weren't already waiting in line before 10:30. I don't think we will be back because this experience left a sour taste in our mouths.\", \"Our service wasn't the greatest. They told us it takes 35-40 for a pizza and we were in a little bit of a rush so just ordered appetizers but those took 40 mins to get as well.\", \"Horrible service. Sat there for 20 minutes before server finally came out. Claims no one told her we were there. Guess she couldn't see us. Had to get something quick because we had tickets to the playhouse theater. Got to the restaurant with more than an hour to spare. She took our order and said she would be back with our bread. She never came back. Another 30 minutes passed, so we decided to leave. Just as we were leaving our food showed up. They couldn't believe we were leaving.  Felt good to stick it to them for a 55 minute wait. Luckily the playhouse is a short distance away.\", 'This review has more to do with the experience rather than with the food.

We just spent $100 on a bottle of wine and five appetizers and it was totally underwhelming. The duck appetizer was tough with flabby skin. The scallop appetizer was cooked well. Roasted vegetables were overpriced at $10. Shrimp crostini was flavorless and didn't seem fresh. Meatballs were nothing to write home to mom about. Service was fine but we won't be back.\", \"Probably made the bad decision of coming here for lunch. Looking at the reviews here, should have tried it out for breakfast. Anyways, figured I'd let others know not to waste their money ordering any of the lunch sandwiches.

We were told there was a 15-20 minute wait. However there were tons of tables open, but okay. I have a background in the biz so I understand sometimes there may be things behind the scenes like short staffed or doubling seating servers, etc. We waited 15 minutes and were sat. The ambience in this place reminds me of the inside of a Pizza Hut sit down restaurant when they used to have the buffets. Not too impressed. The menu also reminds me of a chain-like Italian wannabe. Nothing special or innovative. Yawn. Our server was friendly and took our drink order. She dropped the drinks off and said she would be right with us. We drank our drinks and waited...\\nAnd waited...\\nAnd waited...\\nNo sign of her! I looked at my watch. It was going on 8pm. \\n35 minutes and she never came to take our order. We left some cash for the drinks and headed to another restaurant...one we felt confident would be a better experience. \\nCan't tell you how the food was, but it is safe to say we will never go back.\", \"Do not order the burgers! The menu laughingly states that they have the best burgers in town: not even close. Burger King has more flavor than these clearly frozen, stale tasting, poorly cooked pucks. Also, you could tell that the appetizers, while properly hot, were food service grade, pre-cooked, frozen concoctions that they then reheated. I cannot speak to other menu items, but I'm not going to waste any more money here. There is no excuse for not serving fresh food.\", \"Were there on a Sun afternoon & enjoyed live music, food, ambience.  Returned on Tues 6:00 pm with family and were totally disappointed.

So today I decided to give this place ONE last chance. Came in with my boyfriend and kids. We ordered two Reuben\\'s. One pastrami, one corn beef and we split them as we always have. The kids ordered typical kids meals. When our food came out the Rye was completely under toasted and the fries were not well done. As a server myself I know that the cooks don\\'t always listen to what the ticket said. One of the kids meals was completely over cooked, and the other was under cooked! (Roasted turkey under cooked, chicken fingers over cooked) The manager/host came up to the stand (which was directly behind us) and started coughing very loudly. I turned around to make sure he was ok and he\\'s facing my table and coughing without covering his mouth! At that point I had enough! I politely asked our waitress for a box & the check. When I went up to pay the same manager/host was there to cash me out, didn\\'t even ask how everything was just grabbed the money out of my hand! The entire time I was there the manager/host was yelling at the busser about cleaning tables; from what I saw the busser moved very quickly and there was only one busser from what I saw so yelling at him was uncalled for especially in front of guests! He also yelled across the restaurant several times for \"Ashley\" to come get a beer for another server, instead of just walking his lazy a** the 5 feet to the table it needed to go to! And last but not least, the manager gave me and the kids a dirty look and scoffed when one of the children asked if he could go give our server her tip, which is completely uncalled for and unprofessional! I told him yes but he needed to wait until she was done at the table, which he did. He then waited for her by our table and handed her the tip and smiled. She was very polite to all 4 of us and addressed any and all concerns we had! I\\'d suggest my server find a job elsewhere, she was absolutely fantastic and the ONLY reason I\\'m even giving 1 star! I will NEVER be back unless the management changes!!!!! I have been a server for over 10 years now so I know what is expected out of servers, bussers & management and this manager was by far one of the WORST I\\'ve ever seen in any restaurant!

She ignored me and made my crepe from her pile of previously made Crepes and I could see that she still had at least three more premade crepes yet to use. My crepe was soggy and a little gross.

So I tell him that I know what I saw and it happened for three crepes not just mine. Again he tells me no I'm wrong they are not allowed to do that and so it was impossible. I told him that he was calling me a liar which is a bad thing to do to a customer and that I was there and he was not so I would know what happened. I tried logic as well explaining that the word impossible implies that there is no possible way for her to have done however anyone could make a bunch of crepes and pile them on top of each other. It's not even hard and in fact obviously she did it to cut corners and save time for herself.\\n\\n For the next twenty mins he tells me that I have no idea what I am talking about, that its impossible to happen and that I'm wrong. He also has the audacity to say I'm just in a bad mood so I'm saying these things because of that. First of all this guy knows nothing about me and I was in a great mood before when I started to tell him about it I just wanted them to make sure it doesn't happen again. Now every time I come to get a crepe he asks me if I'm in a bad mood or not which makes me feel very uncomfortable. Plus when I told him that his customer service was horrible and NO ONE talks to a customer that way that wants to run a successful business he tells me the owner would treat me exactly the same way. He gave me a card supposedly with his bosses number on it but after I left a message explaining the whole thing I never heard back. That was over two weeks ago now.\\n\\nI do mostly enjoy the crepes although they are NEVER made the way the example looks.

Luckily, the girl that took our items was working and remembered I had brought items in and she had no idea what they had done with them. Once I started describing items, they admitted they had thought they were extra and put them on another cake (which doesn\\'t make sense because I watched them staple the bag to our order).  I demanded to speak with the owner and she wouldn\\'t come out because she was too busy(I could hear her telling her staff member that) After 15 minutes of demanding to talk to her, she came out with the MOST RUDE attitude and acted like,\"well, what do you want me to do about it. And said I could just run to the dollar store to get something else to replace it if I really NEEDED the cake that we ordered.\" After telling her that I was on my way to the party and didn\\'t have time to replace the items her and her staff gave to someone else, she returned from the back with a brush and mirror. A BRUSH. After saying I wouldn\\'t have a brush on a cake she just stood there and was like well do you want this cake or not because she had other stuff she had to do. They knew we were in a bind and I paid for the ugly cake. ..with just writing , just so I could get to the party on time. \\nKim is by far the worse business owner I have ever dealt with. She is rude and acts like she doesn\\'t need your business. I would never recommend this bakery to anyone and hope you choose another small business to give your money too.', \"We came here few times as we live at the corner. We loved our previous orders but not the one we made last week. At first it was a little burn, not a big deal, I won't eat the part where it's burn, but after a bite, I noticed something wrong. \\n\\nWe ordered the same than usual and this time I didn't get why I was expected. I didn't get a tomato sauce base as I had on my last orders. It was very frustrating. We went back to explain there was a mistake on our order as there is no tomato sauce so we wanted our order to be right. \\n\\nThey were very rude about it and refused to make another one saying that what I ordered doesn't have any tomato sauce! What a surprise because I ordered it a couple of month ago and I got it with tomato sauce. We were obviously bothering them on a quiet night.\\n\\nOf course, what I ate was super dry without the tomato sauce and the burning!!! I won't go back here anymore!

Nothing wrong with any of the food, the chefs are amazing and we all enjoyed our food. The problem was with the service....\\n\\nWe made a reservation for 9 at 7:15 and we ended up getting their around 6:45. We were told we needed to wait because there wasn\\'t enough chefs, which is TOTALLY fine and understandable. Then the woman at the front seats a party of 2 and another party of 3. So I asked why they were able to sit down before our group (and by this time it was about 7-7:10) and she told me because they had a smaller group.... Okay well if we had a reservation wouldn\\'t we be first to sit down? We didn\\'t care if the chef wasn\\'t ready we just wanted to sit down order drinks and have some appetizers. We were then seated and our server Ivan came over very promptly which was nice. After he got our first round of drinks this is where things went down hill. \\n\\nWe ordered some sushi, simple sushi. Salmon, and shrimp. We ordered 2 rolls, a crunch roll and a shrimp tempura roll. He brought out yellowtail, tuna and 2 veggie rolls. I kindly said that the food wasn\\'t ours and that wasn\\'t what we ordered. He told me that it was and that I was wrong. So I asked to see the sushi paper because maybe I marked the wrong thing. And then he said he threw the paper away but he took the sushi away with a HUGE attitude and said he would go try and find the paper. Well our group could see him in the back area and he pulled the paper out of his apron and came over and said oh yeah I guess it was my fault I brought you guys the wrong stuff.... Okay that\\'s what we tried explaining! The stuff finally comes out and tasted perfect! So then some of us ordered the teppan and we got our miso soup and then once that was done we got our salad. None of us had forks and I\\'m pretty sure maybe 1 out the 9 of us knew how to use chopsticks so I asked for forks and he said yeah no problem. Well we waited out 10 minutes until we saw him again and couldn\\'t find any other servers to ask for their help so we ended up just eating with our fingers. We finally see Ivan and asked for forks again and he said, \"do you honestly need them right now? Your food isn\\'t being cooked!\" EXCUSE ME! I was so furious that he would even come back with such attitude. All of the girls needed forks and so we told him, yes we need them now. I almost got up to go find them myself! Anyways, chef comes, food turned out good and no Ivan to be found for about 30 minutes. So 2 girls in our group asked for boxes, myself included, and it took him about 15 minutes to get them so I ended up eating the last bit of food I was going to take home. So when he brought my box I said, \"I\\'m sorry, I don\\'t need the box anymore I finished what I was going to take home, but thank you!\" (very politely) He then came back with \"ok well maybe if I take your plate away you\\'ll stop changing your mind\" WHAT IN THE HELL!!!! At this point I was done trying to be nice. After2 and half hours I was so glad to be leaving! Ivan was so rude to ALL of the girls in our group! I hope if we go back, which we probably won\\'t, that Ivan will not be there. I always try and give people the benefit of the doubt and maybe he was having a bad day, but if your day is that bad, don\\'t come into work and be mean and rude to your customers.

I sure am glad we bought the mini cinnamon rolls but wish we hadn't bought any. The bread in the cinnamon rolls was dry (either cooked too long or stale), there was hardly any cinnamon filling and the toppings were horrible. Mine was supposed to be a standard cream cheese topping but it didn't taste like there was any cream cheese in it.  Maybe they gave me the wrong topping because it tastes like coconut. My sister got maple flavored which she did not like.  The 6 year old ate her cotton candy frosting but we did not like it.  To say the least, we scraped off all the toppings and still didn't eat all of the rolls. Perhaps this was a fluke but I seriously doubt we will come back to find out. Sorry.

I used to love their hawaiian burger and mushroom burger. GREAT... I mean GREAT burgers. I still can\\'t ding them on the food itself. Everything else on my last visit was a trainwreck. I ate with co-workers. One asked for sweetener for her tea. It didn\\'t arrive. She asked again, and it didn\\'t arrive.

With 10 additional men in the wedding spanning 3 different states, it was extremely convenient for everybody to handle their tux at whatever location was most convenient for them.  Having any one of the other 10 tuxes be compromised in any way (wrong fit, dirty, damaged, missing pieces, etc.) would be an inconvenience and obviously not ideal for a wedding that you pay huge bucks for everything to be perfect.  During the 2 months leading up to the wedding all 11 men went in and got fitted on time with only a few of them needing alterations or different sizes, my husband\\'s being one of them (just one piece of the tux was wrong).  The rest of the guys picked theirs up with no problem, which left them to screw up the one tux that actually mattered most.  When my husband went in the day before the wedding to pick up his tux they couldn\\'t give it to him because they didn\\'t have it.  With only one piece of the tux needing to be replaced earlier in the week, they somehow managed to lose or send out the whole tux.

We were told we could not sit there because there was no server there.  I asked if the server could maybe walk two tables over she said no.  We went inside and asked for a manager and we were directed to the same hostess yet again and was told they didn't know who the manager would be that we need to talk to.

The first batch were really delicious, so we ordered another round. Not at ALL the same drink.  They looked very different, but mainly they didn't taste at all similar.  Very very sweet and acidic, way too bitter.  We politely called the waiter over and asked if the bartender wouldn't mind remaking them since the first drinks we had were very different, and he obliged. A few seconds later the bartender came back and told us she remade the drinks but tasted them and they tasted exactly how they should be.  She was very condescending and rude (My boyfriend and I have both worked in customer service before...when customers are being polite in their complaints, there is no need to be rude back) and said she would make the drink for us 10 times if we wanted but it wouldn't be any different. She said that they first AMAZING drink we had must have been made wrong.  She kept asking us how they were different and we had trouble explaining to her exactly what to change, so we decided to let it go and asked for the check. Yes, we still got charged for the shitty drinks that we left on our table. \\n\\nFor a tequilla bar who is apparently known for their drinks, the inconsistency is frightening.

I ordered something from the menu that did not have goat cheese listed as one of its ingredients, but she argued with me that the menu did have it listed. I showed her the menu and corrected her.

I ate one and a half and couldn\\'t take anymore. \\n\\nWhen the server came back she gave us a terrible attitude (Although I couldn\\'t blame her.. the resturant was in definate need of an update and repair) She said \"I\\'ll take it to the manager to look at\"   It was odd - we were starving... and we couldn\\'t eat it.. \\n\\nWe recieved a bill for $9.00 for a glass of pop and a hot chocolate... \\n\\nI hope they can turn around - we use to love this place..

First problem was we found hair in our food and it turns out to be one of the rude supervisors and refused to even help us out and denied us our money back so the general manager who was awesome helped us out and refunded us. Then all of a sudden tonight after months of not going back to this we decided to and we specifically asked for our nacho cheese that\\'s comes on the burrito to just put it on the side like all the other t bells do we never got charged for it and my boyfriend is deathly allergic to it and for a soft taco instead of hard shell. Of course it was all wrong cheese everywhere charged for the nacho cheese no soft taco and the young lady who took our order tried to argue with us saying \"you didn\\'t say that\" last time I checked the customer is always right. Working in the food industry i know good service when i see it and she didnt have any of it. Her voice, attitude, body language all wrong. The manager at the time accommodated us. He was polite and so nice. But the young employee however was horrible and shouldn\\'t be even interacting with people. Pathetic attitude, laughing as she got our order wrong and horrible service all around and nothing done about it no apology...nothing. This taco bell just needs new employees and people who actually pay attention to what\\'s going on instead of goofing off.', 'Would never come back to this Quiznos again. We showed up at 10:50am on Sunday and sign says doesn\\'t open till 11am, which i can respect so I waited in my car till 11am and then I go to the door and the lights are still out and it appears that an employee had just arrived and she is giving my wife and I the one minute signal through the window. We stand outside and wait, mind you it\\'s winter and cold. We wait a couple minutes outside and then a second employee arrived and says to us \"it\\'s not open yet\"? The  employee inside lets the other one in and proceeds to tell us to wait longer in which it is 11:05 at this time and none of the veggies and sandwich meat had been out so we decided to go somewhere else. They could have at least allowed us to wait inside. Clearly punctuality is not important to the employees of this store.', 'Ribeye was cold, fries tasted burnt, service was slow, Environment is bad.

So bad I had to create a Yelp account to write a review. That\\'s how piss I was leaving the restaurant. \\n\\nLong story short, we ordered the enormous nachos which they now down sized to a smaller portion than what it use to be. Not to mention guacamole use to be included but now it\\'s an additional dollar. We also ordered 20 piece wings but when it came out, there was only 19 pieces. (Not that we intentionally counted but there was 5 of us And we agreed everyone was going to get 4 each, equaling 20) We brought it to our servers attention who disappeared for long periods of a time. It seemed like we always had to look around to try to find him and flag him down. It was very annoying, the server to the table next to us was more attentive to his table than ours was to ours. 15 mins gone by after we told him, still nothing. Finally he came back and by this time we just wanted our check. When we recieved our check we were still charged full price for the wings. Whatever, it\\'s just 1 wing but the more we thought about it the more we got upset because it seemed as tho they didn\\'t care about customer service much. We seemed like a joke to them complaining about a missing wing. My bf flagged down the manager and when we brought it to his attention, he basically blew us off and said \"I\\'ll take off a dollar for you.\" Now that was insulting. Then out of nowhere our server came over with a plate with just 1 wing on it since he seen us looking for the manager. We don\\'t give a daym about the wing. This is poor customer service. If we would have went anywhere else, they would have apologized for the mistake which we all would have understood, it happens. Then asked us if we needed anything and immediately replaced what was missing and on top of that added some more. Now that\\'s customer service. For what they did, we will not becoming back ever again. It was a daym joke. \\n\\nSo you have been warned, do not go here and expect good service because they really don\\'t give a daym about you.

The Alfred was broken and oily.   The Caesar salad I received with it was just an average caesar nothing to talk about.  The garlic knots were hard. The wings I ordered were over cooked and unseasoned and dry.  My husband ordered a calzone that was soggy and greasy.

Kids got chicken fingers and a burger which also taste frozen and the burger no joke tasted just like a frozen bubba burger you get from the store. Also got the Mango Mai Mai, this I thought for sure would be good but again the fresh was rubbery, over cooked tasted frozen, the baked potato tasted to be old.

I ordered a Mr. B's luncheon salad (dressing on the side) and a catfish fingers app. The salad came WITH dressing; the overly loquacious bartender was at the far end of the bar, regaling diners there with the tale of his losing another customer's credit card earlier in the day, and despite my efforts, I was unable to get his attention. So, I ate the dressed salad. Twenty minutes later, the bartender finally came by, and asked if I had received the catfish fingers. I had not.\\n\\nThe bartender ducked into the kitchen, came back, and assured me that a fresh order of catfish was being made for me. Waited (in vain) for another 30 minutes. When I had been waiting a total of 50 minutes and had still not received my food, I asked for a check (minus the catfish) and a manager. The manager heard my story and professed to be astounded, and he assured me he was going to investigate in the kitchen as to what went wrong. Then he jumped up and left.\\n\\nAnytime that I've experienced a restaurant malfunction of this magnitude, I've been offered some measure of hospitality.

We weren't going to get our bottomless mimosas waiting around for her bc she was sitting & rolling silverware chatting it up with her co-worker. So I took our glasses directly to the  bartender for our refills instead. Food was mediocre at best. I ordered the hot chicken tacos which wasn't spicy at all. My friends ordered the lox, it was fishy and it was more like smoked salmon flakes; no actual slices of smoked salmon. Pricey for what it was. The steak my friend ordered was very salty.

My friend did a call ahead for ten am. My friends tend to struggle with being on time and there is a policy that everyone has to be there to be seated.  The policy makes sense and I was open to the hostess that we were at fault for not all being there.   My friends didn't all show up until 10:40.\\n\\nThere was no table available which was fine since we were late.  But I was not okay with the hostess rudeness towards us.  She told us that we never did the call ahead despite the verified text from the restaurant saying we called ahead on my friend's phone.  We let that comment go since we were taking ownership that we were not all there on time.  She told us that the wait would be about 30-45 minutes and they will text us when the table is open.  She told us to go walk around since there was a farmers market happening close by the restaurant.  She also reminded us that the whole party had to be here.  I don't mind the reminder but again her tone was rude towards us.  We let it go again because we were at fault for our struggle with timeliness. \\n\\nWe take a walk and about ten minutes later we get a text that the table is ready.  We get back quickly and wait in line since there was people checking in/getting seated in front of us.  When it is our turn, the hostess tells us we missed our five minute mark and the wait was going to be a 15-30 minute wait.  Again her tone was rude and this time we were not at fault.  Her time said we arrived there six minutes after the text.  Okay this means... we were on time but we waited patiently in line for people in front of us to check in/be seated.  Which means the hostess did not wait and sat people at our table. \\n\\nI initially was going to let it go but her rudeness was leaving not a good feeling.  My friend argues with her because it was not fair we were being blamed for something that was her fault this time.  Also she told us to go for a walk since the wait was going to be 30-45 minutes?!\\n\\nThe arguing was not worth it and I told my friends we were leaving.

I ate it and the sauce tasted awful. I thought maybe I was being picky so I let my boyfriend try. He thought it smelled and tasted awful. The only part of my meal that I could eat was the grilled chicken which was good, but not worth the price. Also the next day I was sick with food poisoning the entire day.

The owners or managers only seem to care if a substitute was made and who was your server but not that the kitchen staff is being overworked with this crowd and cannot be attentive to their cooking when being pushed like this.  The first manager pushed me to second manager and they really don't seem to care as long as they can push the crowd to fill the tables.

The Coleslaw had a bitter note with a heavy hand on the celery seed. The Mac N Cheese was luke warm less than 100 degrees and wasn't a very complimentary blend of cheese's, it tasted strange. The chicken was luke warm, at best it was 100 degrees which spells their going to make someone sick holding food in the danger zone.

At 6:30 he came in yelling that we have to leave at 9:00 because he has someone coming in and we can\\'t stay there all night. I reminded him that we have a 7:00 reservation and that we spoke several times to confirm and he said \"So what I don\\'t care, it doesn\\'t matter be out by 9.\" He was yelling at me across the restaurant. He was so unprofessional and hurtful, especially since we\\'ve always supported this business. At 8:55 he came in and said we could stay longer, but I couldn\\'t even look at him and everyone was ready to leave anyway. His verbal abuse practically ruined my night.

The bartender who sat us very friendly. The girl who took our order didn't get the order right. I ordered sashimi prior to my meal which never even came out. She was in such a hurry didn't even seem like she was listening. We had three apps, soup and salad all come at the same time. Who does that? It doesn't need to be fine dining but at least let us enjoy one course at a time. Needless to say we won't go back.\", \"I had not patronized McDonald's in many years as there are many other establishments that actually seem to work for their customers business. \\n\\nIt took over five minutes before one of the four employees asked gruffly if I had been waited on. I placed an order for a #1 meal which is their Big Mac. As I waited for 14 minutes to get my meal several other customers approached the counter  complaining about their order accuracy. I watched as several people had to repeat this process three or more times before getting their order right or they gave up in frustration. No staff member including the English speaking manager/supervisor ever apologized or acknowledged the customers exasperation it gave the assistance if caring at all. \\n\\nI figured with my long wait that I would at least get a hot fresh meal but apparently my food must have been praised long before my arrival. I received a cold Big Mac that was half unassembled in the box with my side of cold soft fries.

First, I didn't receive my soda, and had to go get my waiter and ask him for it again. Not too big a deal, but then my daughter's chicken enchilada...had no chicken. We'd already begun eating, and our waiter hadn't come around to see if everything was OK. I asked her if she wanted to send it back but she said no, so, fine. The food itself was OK. We were hungry, we ate it. Her kid's meal was around $6.50, my crispy tacos $7.50, and my soda was $2. I noticed the prices on the menu, but wasn't adding up my bill ahead of time or anything because that's, you know, the restaurant's job. So I didn't blink when a check totaling $22.51 came, and I didn't pay any mind about tipping %20 (despite the faults, I've been a server before, so I can understand). In the end I paid $28. It was after we were long gone that I realized the total Should have been closer to $16, not $22.51. Did I get the wrong check and not notice? Did they add gratuity to a teeny little party of two without even telling me? Either way, that's a big no-no, right?  I wasn't being on my toes I guess, but I still feel a little ripped off. Ultimately they received more money than I personally thought the whole experience was worth, hence my poor star rating.

I got a spicy tuna hand roll and as I look over to the chef who is making our sushi, I see him scooping the spicy tuna with his bare hands and packing it into the seaweed wrap. Then I see him walk over to the microwave oven, touch that with his bare hands, touch dirty menus with his bare hands, and then go back to my spicy tuna roll and continue to scoop it and pack it with his bare hands ! I couldn't eat it after it was served to me. Since I was starving ordered another roll and ate that, but BAD IDEA. I immediately became dizzy and nauseous. I drank lots of water and decided that maybe I could walk it off. We left and continued to walk around downtown santa barbara and no longer than 20 minutes after we left my stomach started to grumble and I felt faint.

Did I already say that? By far the worst food I have ever eaten, ten notches below middle school cafeteria food. Pizza tasted like cardboard. They claim to have \"Sicilian\" pizza but more looked like a oval cheese board. Freezer fries would taste better than what they served which were string fries. They don\\'t include marinara sauce with mozz sticks. Only positive, friendly service on the phone from a young woman.', \"Not sure what the buzz is about this place.  I have neighbors who swore to me this was the best pizza I ever tasted.  I doubted it seriously as there is no good pizza south of North Jersey, but I tried it.  Awful is all I can say... and more awful than the regularly awful Philly style pizza.  The sauce was way too acidic.  I think they tried to compesate with sugar, but it just tasted like sweetened sauce made from rotten tomatos.

The value meal burger was supposed to be a double with bacon and BBQ sauce. Was given a single plain cheeseburger.

One girl was up front sitting down while on her phone- there were four parties waiting and she just sat there on her phone while turning around looking for the other hostess who apparently had to do all the work because she wouldn't even say hello or acknowledge us.  When the other hostess returned, she sat us as well as the other 3 parties while the one continued to stare at her phone.  This continued for about 10 minutes.  This gave us a very bad vibe and we decided to across the street to Guadalajara.\", \"I was a huge fan of the old O'Briens with the dive bar atmosphere and friendly service. The new one however is absolutely terrible. Very few of the original staff remained on the payroll and the replacements are rude and just about worthless. To top it off they currently employ bouncers ( for whatever reason is unclear to me considering it is a calm, older crowd overall) and one of which has a Napoleon complex and makes your stay uncomfortable with his patrolling around and instigating problems so he can flex his tiny muscles. The food is decent if you're lucky enough to get the right order and assuming it's still hot when it gets to you. Also, the live bands they have are never good and the place is not rated for sound so all you hear is loud yelling and feedback and your only escape is to the sauna they call the outside bar where you can sweat and battle Mosquitos and watch the owner pound back drinks and make sexual comments to female patrons. Lastly there is no entertainment value. The TV's are not synced to speakers so you can't hear the game and the engineering genius put the dartboard where the waitresses have to walk back and forth to the bar so you're constantly being asked to move. I've given this place multiple chances and really wish I could say something positive but it really is a lot of hype, pricey, and a terrible spot to spend your time and money.\", 'A few years back my wife and I went here for lunch.  It\\'s clearly a bar first and foremost so it was mostly empty when we were there.  I guess some people start drinking early, but not that many this particular day.  We had never been before but were close by and craved burgers and chicken tenders so we gave it a shot.  Again it\\'s primarily a bar so don\\'t expect it to be a place for a relaxing quiet meal for two.  Nothing wrong with that, especially if you\\'re there to watch a game.  I ordered a burger and my wife got chicken tenders.  We got our ketchup and all that situated and started eating.  My wife took a bite of her chicken and immediately received a burn in her mouth. The tender had a pocket of hot grease in it so when she took a bite, the grease spurted out onto the roof of her mouth.  It was so bad it burned off the skin and started bleeding.  She got some ice from her pop to help ease the pain, but that didn\\'t do much.  I got our server\\'s attention and told her that my wife burned her mouth.  She replied, \"Well, they just came out of the fryer\" and walked off.  We ended up leaving with to-go boxes.  The next day my wife went to the doctor as the burn was still bleeding and painful.  We were angry so we notified the corporate office.  A week or so later we got an apology letter and a $20 gift card.  The person who sent the letter said he spoke to the manager at that location and instructed him to have a meeting with his staff about this incident.  As my wife mentioned in her note to the company, it\\'s common practice for servers to tell patrons when their food has just come out of the oven or fryer and to be careful because it is very hot.  But the issue is really about the server\\'s attitude.  We wouldn\\'t have written corporate if the server had been concerned about my wife\\'s burn.  We used our gift card to order something for carry out and brought it home.  We figured this would let it cool down.  But we\\'ve not been back since.  I believe the corporate manager was sincere in what he wrote and am glad he was having the store manager meet with his employees.  However, he should have offered to pay the bill for the doctor\\'s visit.  Hopefully this hasn\\'t happened to someone else.', \"we grew up going to spiro's and the last time i was there we left so disappointed. some of our food came out cold and then they messed up on our sides and when the bill came they tried to charge us for the addition. at the end of the meal the owner came to our table and we told them about all the problems and they did nothing. we left very disappointed and have no desire to go back.\", \"Well, my bf and I were going to eat here for his birthday (a Sunday night) and off we went. The place is the size of a shoebox. Seriously. It is one of the smallest restaurants I have ever seen. Considering Jose Garces opened this post Iron Chef, what's his excuse? Anyway, we were informed it would be a half hour wait and had to give them our name (OK) and cell phone (odd). We were, of course, asked if we would like to sit at the bar. We went back, sidled passed a waiter or two and quickly realized there was absolutely no seating at the bar. I told the hostess we would be having a drink elsewhere, and to please keep our name on the list. So, we went and had a beer elsewhere, and about a half hour later, I asked my BF if his phone had rang at all. It had not. He called VW and was informed that they had called. We went back to VW and the hostess chirped that it was their policy to call twice. I said I had a hard time believing that as my bf's phone showed no missed calls, no messages, nothing. She said we could wait another half hour, if we liked. I almost told her to go eff herself. My bf used their bathroom and we went to Standard Tap instead. \\n\\nSo the 1 star is for their total lack of space and lame waiting list procedure. \\n\\nThe food I saw looked good though. \\n\\nMaybe I will go on a Monday at 4:00 or something.\", 'I cannot understand why this place has a decent rating.

This summarizes our visit on the night of Gasparilla.  \\n\\nThis was, without a doubt, the absolute the worst service ever.

When I walked up to the counter to check on the food.... the order was never put in. We were told to wait for 10 minutes   15 minutes later was told it was 5 more minutes. Once the food arrived, it was VERY good... but we had to take it home and eat it because it was past the children's bed times at that point.  Mind you, people who arrived after we were seated got their food, ate, and left before we even saw a slice of our order.  Nice.\\n\\nRecently I read a story that Cappy's has pretty much barred kids from the joint, citing misbehavior.  Well, given that on my one and only visit to the place the incredibly horrid service required my children to wait in excess of an hour and fifteen minutes to GET a pizza, this won't be an issue for me (although for once in their lives they were actually behaving despite the excessive wait).  \\n\\nWhile I am all for the supporting of local businesses (especially in the Seminole Heights area) and definitely see the appeal of a place like Cappy's (it is pretty cool inside, and had a nice vibe), my experience coupled with the anti-kids stuff I read pretty much sealed the deal for me.  I won't be going back, with or without kids.  Stephannos is right up the road, and they make a great pie without the drama.\", \"Not a fan. Sorry. I'm clearly in the minority here. I had the Chicken Platter, which ended up being a flattened, breaded, fried chicken cutlet. The sauce drizzled on top was syrupy and sweet but not in a good way.

Our server flew right past our table to the table behind us to ask if they needed anything, then she started to walk away.

We gave it a shot and it wasn\\'t too bad, but still we found the price rather steep.\\nThis most recent visit, we discovered the price had gone up to 29.99.  Still willing to give it a chance, we got seated.  We ordered our drinks and three buffets, along with one dozen chargrilled oysters, as they are not on the buffet.\\nAfter we received our drinks and started on the buffet, my husband had to remind the waitress that salads were included with the buffet, which she then brought.  Near the end of our first round of fried foods, half a dozen oysters arrived.  Not being terribly anxious to wait another 20 minutes for the rest of the oysters, we did not say anything about it.\\nThe buffet:  It would seem that most of the food had been out there for quite some time.  The restaurant was not very crowded at all, so we understood why there might be some items that needed refreshing, but nearly all of the food on the buffet was rubbery and old.  When the server returned and asked us how everything was, we shared that detail with her and she said a half-hearted \"sorry\" and said that \"they can drop some more, if you want?\".  The reasons we declined this offer are numerous.  One - twice we had to get up and ask the hostess or another server to please locate our server, as we hadn\\'t seen her  in a significant enough amount of time, so we didn\\'t have a whole lot of faith in her expediency.  Two - almost everything on the buffet needed replacing, how long would we expect that to take after we\\'d already been there near an hour?  And three - I don\\'t feel that the customer should be asked if they would like fresh food, it\\'s awkward and inappropriate.\\nWe decided to go ahead and get the check, but unsurprisingly, our server was absent again.  We again approached the hostess area and asked if she could please find our server.  She asked who that was and we were unable to answer, as she never told us her name.\\nShortly, a different server came and delivered our bill.  We prepared our payment and waited.  And waited.

When main course was brought out 7 of 8 people received their entrees.  Last persons entree was a shrimp dish and when it arrived 20 minutes after everyone else's the shrimp were raw.  Shocking service!\", 'This was quite a surprise. We will never ever step a foot into this establishment. Hostess was so rude. She made us feel like peasants. She was a blond not very attractive woman on June 22, 2016 at 8:45pm. My husband leaned his ear towards the door to hear the music that was playing. She was blocking it completely and he gently put his fingertips on her shoulder, very unobtrusive, she turned and said \"sir, don\\'t touch me!\" With a look to go with it, that said this man is touching me inappropriately. She made us feel awful. We will never go in this establishment. We have been here three times and never encountered any treatment quite like this.  I hope the owners take this review seriously, because we frequent this area often as does our extensive family, not only will we never visit this establishment but we will also urge our friends and family to walk past the doors of the \" Three Muses\".', 'I am shocked at how horrible this establishment was. My family decided to come here for my dad\\'s birthday and it was a big mistake. We waited 10 minutes for a server, over 20 minutes for drinks and almost an hour for our food! When someone would request a beer the waitress would go to get it and come back saying that they were out of this beer. This happened at least 5 times. A better name for this place would be \"World of No Beer.\" the food was average at best. This is completely unacceptable. The only reason we even got our food is because we went inside to find the manager. However, the manager was nice and took the food off of our bill. You could not pay me to come back to this place. It was a waste of time and extremely frustrating. Happy birthday Dad!', 'I used to love this place. But we went in, there was around 6 of us. the waitress was \"bitchy\". Our group was not expecting 5 star service and we were pretty low maintenance. But damn, she was not very nice. I doubt we\\'ll go back.', 'What a mistake staying here.  First off, I know it is a giant place and all that, which was neat to see and experience.  You have to travel a bit to get to your room, which involves waiting for very slow elevators each time.  The rooms were ok, but the walls were paper thin, you could hear doors opening and closing and talking in the hallways all night.  I also had to listen to the people in the room next to me \"making love\" - that was very loud as well.  Oh joy.  \\n\\nTried to get out of the parking lot the next day took about $20 min, card was not coded and had to pay $21 for parking.', \"Not impressed. The volcano roll was tasteless and dry with no resemblance to what sushi should be. The second roll ordered also had just a slither of tuna which was no match for the over fried shrimp core. In short, I've had better sushi at Kona Grill....and I don't go there for sushi.\", \"Why does anyone shop here when we have Total Wine? The beer and wine prices are higher than any grocery store in town. No one there ever seems to know anything except how to be rude and surly. The hard alcohol prices are a joke. Seriously, please go to Total Wine, Plaza, Rumrunner...anywhere but here. We live on this side of town but spend the time and gas for better selection, prices and service. Soon, Total Wine will be at Park Mall. Can't wait!\", 'I am a burger lover! This place was recommended on MSN as a great burger joint. They got it wrong!  My order was wrong, all 8 burgers at our table were well-done, the burgers are quite small for the price, the fries were cold and the service was mediocre at best. I wanted to love it but will never return. Five Star and even 5 Guys blow this place away.', 'Taps are dirty / beer is flat and the food sucks \\nThey managed to screw up a baked pretzel app.  How do you do that?\\nNot a fan', 'Such a disappointment. The chips and salsa were the worst I have ever had at a Mexican restaurant. We ordered guacamole , hoping it would be an improvement. Was not.\\n\\nI ordered the taco Tuesday special. The tomato sauce they used for the tacos tasted like marinara sauce.\\n\\nMy fiancé ordered a quesadilla. She asked for no peppers but it came with peppers. She told the waitress who took the plate back. When the waitress came back, it looked like she had just scraped the peppers off. The knife that was included with the dish was also dirty. We suspect she used it for scraping off the peppers.\\n\\nAll in all, probably the most disappointing meal I have had in a long time.', \"Saturday at 530 pm.  Probably the worst time to go but we had a gift card and we were in the area.  The place was packed and people standing waiting for tables.  Very noisy and cold.\\n\\nAfter an initial delay to our food. Caused by what they said the chef was not happy with the crabcake being burnt.  My partner had the crab cake sandwich with fries.  She enjoyed it, but found the fries to be too salty.  I had the broiled scallops and shrimp entree, advertised with lump crabmeat and asparagus.   Well there was no lump crab meat and asparagus  was almost none existent.  3 scallops  and 3 shrimp.  Apparently  the chef is ok with sending no lump crab meat out with a dish but draws the line at over cooked crab cake.  Staff was apologetic  and gave us a $10 card good on a return visit.  Not happening.\\n\\nThey must be doing something right because the place was packed.  Maybe we were just unlucky.  But, our experience was not good, hence the 1 star.   Maybe I would go back just for appetizers,  but that's it.  Go elsewhere with your hard earned dollars.  $$$\", \"We have had Verizon Wireless and DSL for 6 years.  The most notable thing about Verizon is their DSL service that simply does not work 10% of the time from week to week.  \\n\\nWhat is even more notable, is that Verizon's tech support is virtually useless.  It is so bad that you wonder if you have mistakenly called the wrong number and are being pranked as in a Jerky Boys type of thing.\", 'The food here is amazing but is completely tarnished by the terrible waitress. If 0 stars was an option I would have selected that considering that the waitress attempted to murder my friend. The orders began as normal with myself and my friends informing the waitress that someone in our group is severely allergic to cucumber and that none of our dishes can contain cucumber. She said \"okay, the beef dish contains cucumber so do you want it taken out?\" We said \"yes\". The first order of dishes came out without cucumber and all was fine. The second order of dishes did not go well as cucumber was included on the dish. We asked the bus boy to take the dish back and he said he would have to get the waitress who came back and yelled at us that we did not inform her of a food allergy. She continuously yelled stating \"you ordered it like this\", \"I only brought what you ordered\", \"you get what you asked for\" and proceeded to get closer to my friend and yell in her face while my friend calmly tried to explain that we said we cannot have any cucumber on the table. She took the plate and then had the bus boy bring it back without cucumber. Given the severity of the allergy, we moved the plate to the opposite of our friend. We were unsure if the plate was taken back and just replated without cucumbers and felt that anaphylaxis wasn\\'t worth it. After yelling, she refused to come back to our table the rest of the night and sent bus boys to take our requests. If you or anyone here has any food allergy, it\\'s not worth the risk because even normal forewarning is useless here and if you try to clear up any misunderstanding the waitress may yell at you like they are from WWE. The busboys deserve all the credit for making the night salvageable as they were attentive, courteous, and on top of it.', \"Worst experience I have ever had at chipotle.

I get \"Optimized\" about 75% of the time. \"Optimized,\" as in you\\'re connected, but no data is being transmitted to you so you have no internet servece.  Verizon does this intentionally, I believe, to force 3GB users to upgrade to the more expensive 4GB service. Verizon told me that \"4GB service isn\\'t optimized, so you get uninterrupted service.\"  What the tech, in effect, was telling me is that Verizon is intentionally defrauding me of internet service to force me to buy a more expensive service.

Upon entering we were yelled at to shut the door (we were literally just crossing the threshold when the waiter snapped at us) and then he took menus and literally threw them on a table and walked away. We waited for over 10 minutes before anyone ever greeted the table and the only reason anyone ever came was because I had to flag down another server when she walked passed us (and another table who had been seated just before us who also had no server) to greet a table who just walked in. Our server was the same guy who yelled at us earlier and when I suggested to my sister that she order her food with her drink he said \"yeah lets just get this all over with at once\". The burger was disgusting, it looked like a McDonalds hamburger but greasier. I just got coffee so I can\\'t say I tasted it but if it had been served to me I would have returned it. I had to flag the server down for the check and when I put my card out to be taken (everyone else was paying in cash) he walked by literally six times without taking the card. I ended up just paying cash. I have served my entire college career so I understand what the job is like but to be blatantly hostile is something I will never understand. Yes, we are tourists just like probably 90% of the restaurant (it was Sugar bowl weekend so the team colors gave it away) but that is no excuse to treat people so poorly.

My colleague called this location to complain, the manager he spoke with said he would remove the wraps from bill, but we had paid cash. Also stated he would send a gift card, it's been two weeks and still did not receive.  After spending $45.00 for a basic lunch, plus a tip to the person who brought it to the car, one would expect a bit of a response from the management.  I chose PF Chang's as a nice treat for lunch, as a job well done for one of my employees, how embarrassing that it was so terrible.

We waited at least 15 minutes to place an order while watching the brothers argue in the door to the kitchen. \\n\\nThe food we got, bread and either whipped butter in a dish of oil, was revolting.

I thought to myself, \"wow it must be awesome!\" So I decided to grin and bear the wait to finally experience what I thought was gonna be awesome. The breakfast was extremely expensive for mediocre taste. I had a simple breakfast of 2 eggs, home fries, turkey sausage and 3 pancakes and I asked for a side of toast (the honey\\'s platter) What I received was the smallest pancakes I\\'ve ever seen, 2 eggs, one small sausage, a bite of potatoes and my side of toast was one slice not even toasted. This platter cost me $13 THIRTEEN DOLLARS!?!? The taste was sub par I couldn\\'t finish the sausage bc it was gross, the potatoes were greasy, the eggs were cooked well and so were the pancakes but 13 dollars for a standard breakfast is insane. My one slice of untoasted bread was another $2.50!!!! Don\\'t get me wrong I\\'m all for spending a decent amount of money on a good meal but this was hardly that. My dining partner got the Christo which is essentially a ham and cheese sandwich and a small amount of greens on the side, which she enjoyed but was $14. All in all the check came to $42 after drinks and tip. I would never return to this place, I left feeling dissatisfied and let down and created a yelp account just to write this review. The only thing good about this place was the company and the service was on point (but I guess it should be when you\\'re charging that much for breakfast items)  If you want a good meal that\\'s worth your $ with top notch food this isn\\'t the place and you should try Silk City!', \"I've been here a few times, tried it one more time.

How in the world can they sack up and order that has items that are standard with every order I have no idea. To make matters worse, I called since the distance we live it's not practical just to jump in the car and go back for the items they screwed up on. No one would answer the phone for several minutes. After multiple attempts, a girl finally answered. When I asked to speak with a Manager, she just hesitated and said ok. Then she literally put the phone down, and I could hear their conversation, none of which involved needing a Mgr on the phone. Hung up after a few mins, only to call and call to listen to a busy signal. The food itself was ok, chicken seemed like it had been cooked for awhile and the amount of wasted extra skin made small pieces look huge. Clearly this location has lost it's way but I even filled out a customer survey on the receipt asking to speak with a Mgr or GM, even the owner. Never even heard from a line cook so Churchs as a whole must have no regard for customer service. Why even have a survey on the receipt? If they had just answered the dang phone that day and addressed the situation I would have possibly returned to get my items they shorted me and it would have been over.

We wrote our party's shoe sizes on the appropriate slip and received our footware. A few pairs were the wrong size (3 of 8), but it was easy enough to resolve. After getting settled at our lane, we ordered a few drinks. After receiving our drinks, the waitress (named Leah E., according to our receipt) never came back to us. We waited for roughly 30 minutes for her to come to us but never did. For approximately 20 minutes after that, we waited for her to come into our vicinity and tried to flag her down, but it took a few tries before she saw us. Please know that while the lanes on either side of us also had parties, half of the lanes were unused, the bar was not full, and the tables were empty. It was a Sunday evening at about 8:30 or 9. Once the food was delivered, we never saw our server again. Please don't misconstrue my statement as hyperbole...I didn't just not see the server at our table, I didn't see her at any table. She didn't check on the two neighboring parties, but we did see her behind the bar a few times. She was not the only server on staff, as others were seen serving other lanes and, as established previously, the place was not busting at the seams. The food order was wrong, the drink order was improperly charged, we had to go to the bar for silverware. We did go to the bar for drinks due to her absence, and the bar service was pleasant but slow. When the check came and we attempted to fix a mistake on the check (we ordered a single slider burger but were charged for a plate. When we brought it to her attention, she said not to worry about it. We asked if we would be charged for just a slider (aka the thing we ordered) or if we'd be charged the plate meal (what we got). She replied that we would be charged the single slider. When the check came, we were charged the meal. She changed it without complaint. However, someone in our group ordered two wells vodkas and she charged Ketel One to the ticket both times due to a misunderstanding. She was less happy and less willing to understand or resolve this issue, resorting to having another server bring the final ticket, run our card, and bid us farewell. She did not make eye contact after his point (even after a member from our group returned to the table to retrieve a jacket). She did not apologize for mix ups, misunderstandings, or wait times, and she did not thank us for our business or wish us good night.To top it all off: while I think waitstaff have the right to whatever emotions and experiences they will on a given shift, our server was not the most cheerful person. It could be that she had a bad night (God knows we all have em).

I asked if he could open me and my friends wine bottles and out of no where a cork screw lands on the table right in front of  me. He literally threw a cork screw at me for me to open my own wine bottle. He then proceeds to write my order and I saw him write it down with his pen on his pad. Food comes out and I don\\'t get my meal, everyone is eating and he said he didn\\'t write it down wanted to know what I got and he\\'ll put in the order now.  He then places soup in front of me and says \"here this will keep you preoccupied while you wait\".... Oh thanks! Everyone in my party is finished eating so I tell him to please just cancel it if the chef didn\\'t start making it and he goes.. \"ok\" and walks away...not are you sure? it\\'ll be a minute... So he brings out the food anyway and I said I\\'m sorry I don\\'t want it anymore thanks though, because I\\'m beyond annoyed at this point and he goes well \"the chef didn\\'t even want to make it... It\\'s on the house.\" WHAT THE HELL did that even mean?! I don\\'t know how the food is because I didn\\'t eat, but service is terrible. Especially Casey.', 'I wish I could say something really nice about this place, but after the experience i had its hard too. I was brought to this restaurant by my daughter for a Birthday dinner.

We had to ask other girls for drink refills and the check, and tipped the girl who helped us the most--not our original server. When our food came out, the order was messed up, and when we asked about it, the server snapped at us saying she didn't know anything about that because she wasn't our server. Really?

Just a lame apology--no discount, no free dessert or drink, no compensation at all for the huge inconvenience caused by them and them alone. Definitely won\\'t be returning to this location.

As we pull into the parking lot - at 2:30 in the afternoon, mind you - we see two girls (not grown women, girls) standing behind one of their cars out in the open in the main lane of the parking lot just feet from the entrance MAKING OUT.

Although I can't be 100% certain, I do assume she works there....she was carrying a server apron and other items in with her. When we tried to call and inform the management, we were lead in a circle of automation that never allowed us to talk to an actual person.

The manager/owner (I'm not sure what position he holds) is extremely rude to every customer that walks in the door. He's an older man with glasses and a constant look on his face as if he hates his life and job. If you see him, be prepared for a world of rude and abrasive responses. On one occasion, we went in and were told it would be a 45 minute wait even though there were multiple tables (both hibachi and regular) open. While I have worked in food service as a manager much of my adult life, I understand there are circumstances that are often out of the managers' control in terms of who is working and how many tables a server may have. However, there is an appropriate and POLITE way to address the situation. Today I called the restaurant repeatedly to see what time they served lunch till. The phone rang and went to an answering machine each time. When we arrived at the restaurant, the man, who seemed more preoccupied with his laptop and sitting on his butt, was extremely rude to the guests in front of me as well as to myself and my family. He snapped as us and said they are closed at 2:30 - it was 2:15 when we walked in. If the restaurant closes prior to the posted time, they should probably lock the door or put a sign outside to avoid any customer interacting with this so-called manager. I will never recommend this restaurant to anyone and will never be back to be treated so poorly for over-priced, sub standard food. It is pity because we live so close and would probably be frequent guests at such an establishment. Between our group and the group in front of us, the restaurant lost out on hundreds of dollars of business. This has been a consistent experience and it is absolutely ridiculous. Do not come here, go anywhere else that deserves your hard earned money. The experience and cost are not worth the time and frustration. This place should be shut down or hire new managers to run it. Ridiculous.\", 'This place is just horrible,,,,, I have tried this place twice and i will never go back.\\nthe poatatoes might be the worst ive had borderline unedible,,, and the wait is suprising because of how bad the food is , they all must be there for the first time, i cant understand how they get any returning business.

I again asked about buying the Moto G5, and he said they did not sell it.  I walked over to the one tethered to the counter and said I was confused.  He said \"We don\\'t sell those anymore.\"   I asked what phones they DID have that were no more than 5.5 inches long.  Other than an iPhone, none. He also said they sold no unlocked phones.   I asked if I could buy an unlocked phone elsewhere and bring it in to buy a prepaid service plan.  He said he would go and ask.  He then went behind the counter, entered a code into a door lock, slipped into a back room for several minutes, and then came out and said no dice.

The first 5 minutes we were there the waiter came over 3 times to ask if we were ready to order the menu is huge so it took us some time. We finally ordered, food came out quickly, very quickly. The server paid no attention to the fact that some of our belongings were on the table (keys, cell phones, etc) before we could move anything he placed our plates directly on top of everything. We ate, food was good not great, we split 2 rolls and a bento box, with the intention of ordering more if this was not filling enough. Before we finished eating we were brought our check, which destroyed any possibility of ordering more. We ate all the sushi and were picking at the bento box and drinking our wine when our server came over to take our check, my friend stopped him because we had not put our money in it yet and explained that we were still eating and drinking and not ready to pay. Then the waiter said \"So you can\\'t pay your bill and finish your food?\" so so so rudely. We both stared at him in shock as he continued to rush us to pay him and get out of the restaurant. I have never experienced anything like it, mind you we were not even there for an hour when this occurred. We were so uncomfortable we did not finish the food or wine and just left. We won\\'t be back, mostly because it was the weirdest, most rushed, rudest service I have ever experienced.', 'Cold food does not rock my boat. I had a soft shell crab Poboy and my husband had grilled shrimp. I think it would have been wonderful if served hot.', \"If you like practicing your lip reading skills (noisy) and daydreaming about who on earth trained the wait staff (who can't manage simple things like a water refill when they bring your food and your glass is dry; who can't bother to serve an a la mode dessert with less than completely melted ice cream; who don't warn you that one of the desserts is drastically different from the description on the menu), this is your place.  The mediocrity of the food won't distract you much from that core experience, though the bill might.\", 'We have been here a few times before and really want to like this place because it is so convenient to where we live.  We walked in and stood at the hostess stand for over 5 minutes while the hostess remained on the phone without even acknowledging us.  We were seated and then it took an additional 12 minutes for a server to come to our table.  We both ordered hibachi dinners and were extremely disappointed.  The soup tasted like dish water and our entrees were served at room temperature (at best).   The waiter gave most of his attention to the hibachi tables, and walked by us with an \"Oh Crap!  I forgot their food\" look.  Granted, it looked like he was one of only two servers working a nearly full restaurant.  He was very nice to us when we brought up how unsatisfactory the food was.  At $15 for an entree, it should be served hot.  Right?  He apologized and offered to have the kitchen make us new meals, but we had already been there over an hour and could not wait through that process again.  We ate the remainder of our meals, and were really not surprised when we got the check and no discount whatsoever was there to at least attempt to make amends for our awful experience.  No manager came by the table.  If they don\\'t care more than that, then we do not care to go back.

I ordered a classic grilled cheese sandwich, which is supposed to contain - you guessed it - just cheese. However, some of the staff members seemed distracted while they were making it. I didn't think anything of it until I got in my car and started chowing down. I thought it was odd that the sandwich tasted spicy (like, reeeeeally hot spicy) but I was SO hungry, so I kept eating half of it. Then I tasted something funny. When I opened up my sandwich, I saw turkey. Now, for most people this would not be a big deal, but for me, I've been a strict vegetarian since I was a kid, and meat makes me really sick, so it was a big freakin' deal. Made me throw up. Now I'm grossed out and sad because I used to love 'feine, but am now really disappointed - they should have been more careful. Turkey wasn't even on the grilled cheese menu, so I'm really confused as to how it got into my sandwich. Ughhh.\", 'DO NOT ORDER FROM THIS IMOS. I have never had a worse experience with any pizza delivery service than I have in the multiple times I have tried to give this location a chance. The first time I ordered it took them over an hour to deliver and my pizza was cold and hard. Literally not even edible. I requested a refund but was denied, of course. I also ordered a salad with the cold hard pizza which they left at the store. They said it would be over an hour before they could go get it. Never got it. And never got refunded. The second and last time I gave this place a chance they took over an hour to get to me once again and delivered my pizza and salad but forgot the salad dressing. I called the manager and was assured the dressing would be brought to me in 15 minutes. Needless to say it was another hour before I got the dressing.

Ordered #8 sandwich but upon going home realized they gave me the wrong sandwich. Normally not a big deal but thought I'd take it back to exchange for the correct sandwich. Upon going back the lady at the counter refused to correct the mistake.  In her mind I ordered the #10 because on the ticket that is what she wrote down. Her attitude was horrible and completely smug the whole time to actually make this a big deal. To not fix a sandwich order over a 2 dollar upcharge is absolutely ridiculous especially when I made the effort to drive all the way back. Then to add her lack of empathy is what really pissed me off enough to write my first review. Excellent business plan, lose customer over a 2 dollar mistake.\", 'Buffalo Wings generally have pretty consistent service and food quality -- I mean, how hard is it to serve reheated chicken and beer?  Well--evidently, pretty hard.  We arrived at 5:45 -- pretty early for dinner -- and were told a 20-30 minute wait, which turned into a 45 minute wait.  That should have been our first sign something was amiss.  After waiting 45 minutes, we already knew what we wanted to order, so ordered immediately after being seated at 6:30.  We ordered a chicken salad, a burger, a wrap, boneless wings, and a kids mini corn dogs.  60 minutes later we finally got our food.  Our waitress was great, and came by every 10 minutes to ask if we needed anything (other than our food), but all she could say is it should be coming, it should be coming.  We asked if the order was lost, and she said she saw it up on the screen in the kitchen, and said she had confirmed the kitchen had seen it, and that the screen shows them how long a order has gone unfilled, so they should know it had been an hour.  She had even talked with the manger.  Despite this, it took a full 60 minutes to bring out 6 items which literally have 5 minute prep time.  The chicken on the salad, wrap, and wings had all been precooked and heated under a heat lamp -- they were all dry.  They also put dressing on the salad despite asking for it on the side.  The waitress insisted on the manager coming over to us.  She asked him several times.  He finally came over as we were trying to leave, and said \"what is the problem\" curtly as if the waitress hadn\\'t already told him 10 times, before, during, and after our meal was delayed an hour.  When my 74 year old mother politely told him (remember, the waitress asked him to come over, not us), he replied \"did everything come out ok?\" as if the only thing that mattered was did we receive edible food or not after waiting 1 hour and 45 minutes.  The guy acted exasperated, like the whole thing was out of his control.  Dude, I hate to break it to you, but your the manager.  This place is bleeding money -- if you can\\'t get food out in under an hour, you can\\'t turn tables.  The faster you turn tables, the more customers you can serve, and the more money you make.  Also, the less the wait time, so less customers get frustrated and leave and are less likely to come back.  With an hour wait for food, less customers are going to come back again, including us.  Sayonara Buffalo Wings -- it was nice knowing you for 20 years, but after 86th/Ditch service/kitchen went downhill, we were only willing to give you one last chance, and despite having a brand new restaurant with a brand new general manager, you managed to disappoint us even further.  We simply have too many casual dining and bar and grill options to waste our time and money with you.', 'This is by far my worst experience dining in NOLA. Ordered French Onion Soup, veal chop, veggie and bordelaise sauce. My chop was to be medium rare plus ... closer to medium. \\n\\nNo soup showed up. Wrong sauce. And the chop was rare and an end cut. How do you serve an end-cut rare ... and is always reserved for medium well to well orders. \\n\\nTerribly disappointed and all I wanted was a casual good NOLA meal.\\n\\nSecond chance failed miserably!

Last night was an example of how one individual can ruin the evening. When we had an issue with the To-Go order the manager basically told me to pound sand. We dinned in and at the time of seating ordered an entree to take home with the expectation it would be ready when we were finished. Unfortunately that was not the case and I was told when I received my bill that it would be an additional fifteen minutes before my take home order was ready because the kitchen was backed up. When I expressed my disappointment to the waiter, she sent Nanu, the manager over to speak with me. Nanu was not apologetic, did not offer concern and was certainly not  making my satisfaction his priority. I asked him to at least offer the entree to me for half price. He brought back my bill, said he charged me half for my take home order and quickly walked off. When I was leaving he was standing at the front, I told him that his actions were not acceptable and He was obviously not focused on customer service. His response was \"call corporate\". Wow, don\\'t think I will be visiting this restaurant again. Management certainly does not care about the customer experience.', 'First of all I would like to say that the waitresses and bartenders are top notch workers. However, the one manager that wore glasses had a little power trip over the outside windows being open. It was a beautiful 70 degree Sunday, so we decided to go to this location knowing it had a beautiful outside patio. We were very upset when we sat outside and the windows were closed during our dining experience, we asked for the windows to be re opened and he refused. He also refused us other seating to where the Windows were open for our dining experience. After walking ourselves through the patio to the dinning room we found multiple tables that would of accommodated our party.

He had to go back to the store to get it which literally took about 15 to 20 minutes so by the time our drinks got here we were already done eating.

I literally complained about the service and this delivery driver thought that I gave him a $13 tip, didn't even say anything. I go in today to get my $10 back, because I only meant for him to have a $3 tip because his service sucked, and they're only excuse was, I'm sorry he's new.

So far so good. There was 5 of us, so they put us in a booth that fits 4 ppl, and added a chair at the end. Cool, no big deal. Server, Stefanie came by, took drink order, came back and we were ready to order our food. So we did. She was very tentative, we never had to ask for a refill, not even once. That\\'s good service right there. I will give credit where credit is deserved. So, we all decided on having steak tonight. Two youngest wants steak bites, med cooked, oldest daughter wants hers med rare, my ribeye med, and husbands prime rib medium. \\nAfter 30 mins, 8:30 server says she doesn\\'t understand why our food hasn\\'t come out yet she will check, cool. Still no food. Food finally came out steak bites were cold. Matter of fact EVERYTHING WAS COLD. Ok, so food sat in the window. Got someone by the name of Jamie, guest relation guy and told him our food is cold, he apologized and took food to kitchen for recook. He said he would personally see it that they cook it right, HE NEVER RETURN TO OUR TABLE. Time goes by, veru slowly, watching every other table who came in same with us or even after us get their food. So we wait, about 9:25, the remake came out, ran by the SERVICE MANAGER, JODI. This was the first time that she ever came to us. Brought food, had the nerve to ask \" how are you doing\" I replied with angry and hungry, she had no apologies, NOTHING. Food still was not hot, two younger kids food was still well done. I even had Jodi touch the steak bites with her finger, and asked her if it was cold or hot. She said herself that it was cold. I asked her would she have let her kids eat that??? She couldn\\'t answer me. At this point I\\'m pretty frustrated. She said what would I like for her to do. I SAID, IT WOULD BE NICE TO HAVE THE KITCHEN RECOOK IT STAT, SINCE WE HAVE BEEN WAITING SINCE 8PM. As a service manager or any kind of manager, she should be embarrassed to run the food out without looking at the ticket seeing that it was all supposed to be medium cooked. She could not, would not , do anything to keep me from being so angry, and so disappointed because we have never had a problem with any Texas roadhouse before. \\nSo I told her to take the damn food away, and the kitchen manager AJ came out. I asked her to sit next to me and I explained what was going on to her. She seems to understand , but didnt know what to do. I told her, i want the owners business card, and some kind of compensation for being there almost 2 damn hours and my kids were hungry. They were very patience and to the end, still did not have dinner. \\nHere\\'s how I would handle the situation. As a sserver I would tell the manager immediately that the food is taking long. Then when food came out make sure manager would come by and check on guests. That never happened. So when food is sent back, manager needs to be aware IMMEDIATELY. And food will be recooked immediately, STAT, and go out to the table and apologize. That was not done at all. Instead she comes out , so unprofessional, and made situation even worse. \\nSo i have NEVER been so angry ever at any restaurants. If i was the owner, I would call the guest back asap, and see how to get the guest back and give their restaurant another chance. I got the business card and did call Mr. Michael (owner) we\\'ll see if he returns the call. \\nIn the end AJ did get an approval from her owner over the phone to give us a certificate to return for two free meals for 2 adults. I wouldn\\'t want to come back unless I get an invite from the owners and on the day they work to ensure that this does not happened again. So again we\\'ll see if they will reach out to their guest concerns. \\nOvtall, i wouldnt give this restaurant any stars for the food service, but for the server she was good.

The floors were also incredibly slippery and hard to walk on. When I placed my order, it was written down, however, three things didn't come at all. The sushi is low quality. They use entirely too much rice, and the fish does not taste or smell fresh. I couldn't eat it. The cooked food was not awful, but was not worth getting.

Rude, uncaring management. Used to be a great place but the new owner couldn't care less about guest satisfaction. Oh, and if you order something that is not to your liking or satisfaction, you will still have to pay for it. I was treated horribly by the owner when I tried to talk to him about my food. He wasn't the least bit concerned nor did he apologize or compensate for everything that went wrong. All the other reviews talking about the service and management are correct. And the pricing for the quality is too high. Save your money. There are way better Japanese places in the area now.\", 'First let me start by saying I love The Waffle House.  I eat at different locations all around the country.  In fact this location is two miles from my home and I didn\\'t know it was there!  As soon as I found it I made plans to go there the following Saturday for breakfast. Saturday came and I showed up there at about 8:00AM.  It wasn\\'t packed with people waiting to be seated so I sat down in a booth and ordered an ice tea while I looked at the menu.  And then I waited, and waited, and waited some more.  I didn\\'t even get a smile out of my waitress, some young girl who couldn\\'t be over 20 years old.  She was all smiles and friendly to everyone else but I was simply and obviously ignored.  Have no idea why, I was friendly and certainly not \"that\" customer.  Over the course of 30 minutes I watched her smile and greet everyone that sat at the surrounding booths, but not me.  Finally I said to hell with it and put three dollars on the table and left.  I went down Shadeland avenue to a carniceria/restaurant that always has fast and friendly service.  I\\'ll update my review in another month and see how things go.  This time I\\'ll sit at the counter.', \"Kameron just helped us tonight and he was rude and disrespectful to us.

When he gave the sandwich back to the girl making the food instead of remaking the sandwich we watched her just take the turkey off and put ham and cheese on the original sandwich she had made. I won't be coming back to this location because of the service we just revived. I will also be filing a formal complaint with corporate regarding the disrespect we recived.

He should have put them in a bag or wrapped a napkin around them so I got another order of fries.', \"This place is horrendous at best.

We stopped in for brunch, fairly busy: 1 hour and forty minutes, and no one even apologized for the wait.

I was also frustrated that my meal was served with imitation maple syrup in a plastic cup, considering our meal was $30 dollars before tip (you can add real maple syrup for $2, lol).  The hash browns were just terrible, they were slimy and tasted a month old.  The food was almost as good as a quality diner, but not quite.  The space is charming, but it seems like they have far more tables than the kitchen can keep up with.  We sat near the kitchen door and during our lengthy stay you could see the kitchen staff was barely keeping things together.  It's a shame to see a small kitchen working so hard with no hope of getting out of the weeds. The army of servers was very friendly and took our order promptly.  We had high hopes for Blue Plate, but have to say we won't return and wouldn't recommend it to others.\", \"VERY disappointed in the service here  ! My daughter and I walked into the store and were ignored by the girls holding the little carry bags.

We received notice that our room was ready at 4:30 and collected our keys and attempted to get into our room, our keys were not programmed.  Luckily there was a house staff member who also tried our keys as well but eventually used his key to gain entry.  Once inside, the check-in issue that we thought was resolved was not: 2 female colleagues, 1 king bed.  Originally, we had booked & pre-paid for 2 separate rooms, they had asked of we would share- it was unexpected, but we were flexible.  That is until we found out 'sharing' meant the same bed!\\n\\nWe immediately contacted customer service only to wait in the phone system for 20 minutes and another 5 before they thought bringing us a roll away would be acceptable.

So after going back and forth our mysterious reservation appeared and we both ended up with king rooms; however we missed happy hour with our team.\\n\\nThat leads us to dinner....the steakhouse was too pricy and Solario, the Conservatory bar and Ravello's were closed, JD's had a 45m wait so we continued to Delta Island where our disappointment grew into aggravation.  Now completely starving, frustrated and tired from travel and learning- we ended up at a fast food version of pizza, including: a cafeteria line, plastic trays, plastic ware and plastic to-go boxes.

Last time I was very disappointing with a chef that couldn't cook and had no personality. Was advised to ask for Steve and so we did. First, not an ideal table, with all homecoming kids- not the smartest seating by the host as they were dispersed through the house and each table had them and 1 couple. But, frankly the food was just ok as was Steve. Don't know what happened to the chefs that made dining there fun and delicious, like Chris. Chris where are you  now? Although they deny a change in management or organization there are many changes, not for the best which includes the tedious serving of soup and salad at the table by the server resulting in smaller portions and time consuming, smaller dinner portions and the food quality seems to have gone down as well. The good news, definitely not as crowded!\", \"The absolute WORST service EVER... which is so sad because the food really is delicious, but the service is seriously soooo bad it overshadows how good the food is.

Secondly, had the grouper sandwich after everyone raved about the grouper in this area...worst fish sandwich I've ever had.\", \"Will not go back. I had high hopes. A friend recommended it and husband had had lunch here a few times but this was not a great experience. Our waitress was flakey, Drinks mixed up and delivered to the wrong Table. Got Guacamole and no chips. Son's chicken fingers had and odd taste (like fried in old oil and too much flour). Other son ordered Mixtos (steak, pork and chorizo) skillet tacos and  now had an upset stomach. I had the shrimp and crab bake and it tastes like fake crab... and too much cheese. Overall disappointed and underwhelmed. But my jalapeño margarita was good.\", \"Worst Cheesecake Factory ever! Service was super slow and rude. Go to the Green Hills location. It has much better service. I'm astounded at how awful this was.\", 'Terrible \"convenience\" store. The only good thing about this gas station is where it is located. Even so, I will definitely NOT be returning to this place. Every time I\\'ve gone in there the employees are nothing but rude and not at all helpful. I went in there twice in one day and both of the interactions I had with the two different cashiers just left me appalled. The first time I went up and asked for ONE thing behind the counter and the cashier said \"what?\" So I asked nicely again and she still said \"what?\" And after asking her for the second time she then pulls out A headphone from her ear so I can ask a THIRD time. Then I had another encounter later that evening where the male cashier told me \"not to get smart with him\" when I simply asked a valid question about purchasing some ranch. There are just not any nice, personable people working in there. So if you stop here, I\\'d just get gas outside so you don\\'t have to go in and talk to any of their shitty employees.', 'My family has been coming here for years and always loved it, but we had such a bad experience yesterday I doubt we will be back in awhile.  We had to sit on the patio because it was so busy, there was a festival going on, but it was cool, the fans were on and it\\'s covered so we didn\\'t mind.  Our waiter was very good and food was good.  Service a little slow.  However, toward the end of the meal, a lady right outside the patio decided to stop, stand there, and smoke a cigarette for a good 10 minutes, blowing her smoke all over my entire family, including my 10 year old son (it was his birthday), my older son, who has an autoimmune condition, myself, who has severe allergies and asthma, and other patrons including another young child.  When I asked the waiter if she could be made to leave (Florida Clean Air Act), his reply was, \"No, the ashtray is there.\"  So either Hellas provides a SMOKING AREA right next to their DINING AREA (disgusting and unhealthy) or the City of Tarpon Springs does and they do nothing to have it moved.

Beyond disappointed!!', 'Such a sorry shame of a once nice place. Wings are smaller,  greasy, slimy and lacking sauce or flavor. Kind of repulsive actually.

Sorry! !!!!! Michelle', 'Terrible. Not sure how this place got 4 stars.  My coke was flat but instead of fixing it she just took it away.  My omelet was not cooked all the way.  The egg whites were runny -- not cooked at all.  The potatoes were dry and cold.  The only decent thing was the English muffin but how hard is it to toast bread?  I will not be back', \"I've eaten here twice. Once in 2007 and the second time was last week. I only ordered the sliders the second time and they made me sick. The beef had gone bad and I got a stomach ache! Thank god I only ate one. In case you're wondering, the first time I had the chicken picatta and it tasted great. But that was in 2007. So I don't know what happened to this place.\", 'I originally would have given Red Robin 3 stars, but my last experience three weeks ago was so terrible that I just can\\'t do that anymore.  My server was one of the worst I\\'ve ever had.  I just can not bring myself to go back for fear of getting the same guy and having this experience all over again. \\n\\n    Here is the breakdown:  First, he took forever to come to our table and even take our drink order.  I was about to get up and leave.  It had been at least ten or fifteen minutes before he ever acknowledged us at the table and the place wasn\\'t even crowded!  It was a weeknight.  I could understand if it was a busy weekend and the place was packed, but I\\'ve been there on a busy weekend as well, and have not been treated like that.  However, I have on a weekday by a different server, but that\\'s another story, and I left happy because a nice other waitress remedied the situation.  Anyway, this guy finally takes our order and then takes another ten minutes to bring me my water and then starts to walk off again.  I tell him that I would like to order.  I tell him which burger I want and that I want it to be a turkey burger, and with no mayo.  He looks really confused and takes about 3 minutes to write that down.  Then he repeats the name of the burger.  I say, \"Yes, with turkey and no mayo please.\"  He starts writing again for what seems like forever and then my boyfriend tries to order.  Then he starts to walk away and my boyfriend says, \"I\\'d like it medium-well, please.\"  He looked confused and was like, \"oh...\"   Then he asked me, \"How about you?  Medium well?\"  I said, \"Mine is turkey, so I would like that cooked properly please.\"  He said, \"Well, they\\'re going to ask me how you like it cooked.\"  I said, \"165 degrees please, which is the temperature turkey should be cooked to in order to be cooked properly.\"  He tried to argue with me about it and then kind of laughed and walked away.  That is a health hazard under-cooking poultry!   What is wrong with this guy?  I don\\'t think this guy knew anything about food or had ever waited tables in his life.\\n\\n    Then, I finally get my food thirty minutes later and it is slathered in mayonnaise. I try to get his attention for a while, but he ignores me, and I am so hungry at this point and this want to leave this place because this guy is annoying me that I just rip the top half off, wipe it off with my napkin and try to eat part of it.  He comes back about 20 minutes later when I\\'m about done and was like oh was it good.  I told him about the mayo and he said, \"Well, I didn\\'t know that.\"  Then he just walked away!  Weird! He didn\\'t say he was sorry and acted like it was my fault even though I\\'d repeated it twice when I ordered!  So rude too!  Finally, we couldn\\'t get him to bring the check and had to flag him down again.  I thought I would never get out of that place!  It was the worst service I have received in a very long time.  Although I enjoy Red Robin\\'s turkey burger, this service really turned me off to the place.  A lot of time will have to pass before I consider giving it a go again, if I ever do.', 'El peor servicio al cliente que he visto en mi vida! Hice una orden de 2 tacos, un tamal y unos chips con queso. Tras de que se tardaron habían personas que llegaron después de mi y ya estaban comiendo. Luego de esperar casi media hora por unos simples tacos voy al counter para que me devuelvan el dinero porque no quería mi orden ya que nunca llegó. En ningún momento se disculparon conmigo por la tardanza, ni me dieron la razón y tras de eso son tan poco profesionales que sabiendo lo molesta que estaba y que había posibilidad de que no volviera no hicieron ni un mísero intento por retenerme como su cliente, al contrario, como ya me habían dado un refresco en lo que esperaba la comida pues me dieron el reembolso completo de mi dinero pero luego me cobraron el refresco!

I made an order of 2 tacos, a tamale and some chips with cheese. After they were late there were people who arrived after me and were already eating. After waiting almost half an hour for a few simple tacos I go to the counter to get my money back because I did not want my order since it never arrived. At no time did they apologize to me for the delay, nor did they give me the reason and after that they are so unprofessional that knowing how upset I was and that there was a possibility that I would not return they did not make a miserable attempt to keep me as their client, On the contrary, as I had already been given a soda in what I expected the food, they gave me a full refund of my money but then they charged me the soda! Your marketing idea is on the ground! I will never go back to that place again. Very unpleasant experience to want to return. They have lost not only my client but also everyone who asks me about their business.', \"First and foremost, i am a new baby vegan and have not consumed egg or dairy or meat for almost 4 months now. I know, I know, tell me about it. \\n\\nI dined here on 07/29/17 and asked my server about vegan options. She went over the menu with me and I decided on a bowl of the Mediterranean Vegetable Bow tie pasta, sans pesto and cheese. It arrived, it was hot and delicious and filling, I paid and left. \\n\\nA couple hours later, I ended up feeling quite sick, and I wondered if it could have been something to do with my food, so I googled the nutritional information and found out that my pasta had egg in the pasta noodles, and dairy in the sauce. My waitress lied to me. \\n\\nI know it's not that big of a deal, I'm not allergic or anything, but come on. If you're not sure about the menu, ask. \\n\\nIf I could give 0 stars I would.

I even showed her with my hand how thick the crust should be( around 5 inches) she assured us that there pizza was like Chicago style, so we ordered one. Not only was it not thick crust it was like cracker thin hard like that of cardboard crust. I asked her about and all she said is it depends on the cook. The pizza was awful, she never apologized or offered something else. I will never be back.\", 'Man the service sucks here. Suuuuuuucks. \\nI\\'ve been here several times and the attitude of the employees is terrible. The food is decent and there\\'s a good beer selection, but I\\'m tired of being treated like shit by the too-cool staff.

Three. Not sixteen or a thousand, three. And my servers idea was that all five of us should go stand awkwardly in the middle of the restaurant to go figure out what they were. If this was a pizza place I would understand. But the food is $15+ a plate, so it\\'s not crazy to think that your server, who presumably enjoys receiving tips, could tell you the specials.\\nSo I went to the bar area hoping to see the manager. I was told that he was \"upstairs\" and that \"he doesn\\'t like to be disturbed. But I guess you could tell me, like, what the issue is, and I could like, ah, tell him later.\" \\n\"Are you the assistant manager or something?\"\\n\"Nah, I\\'m one of the bartenders.\"\\nYeah. Great. So shit service and a manager locked away in his high tower.

The service was HORRIBLE. I had made reservations the day before and was promised a room. We got there and sat for over an hour. We would have left but it was late and we were out for a friend's birthday. The food was ok but everything was way too salty. To top off our fabulous night the owner, Ken, kept coming into our room and pretty much was trying to flirt and hug everyone. He was very drunk and incoherent.

The pizza (which we waited 30 minutes for, though we were the only customers in the place) was thin and limp crusted, with rather sparse and unflavorful toppings. The Greek (Grecian) pizza was particularly \"blah\" tasting, and for some might even be considered disgusting. Very strange. Their somewhat Hawaiian-like pizza was okay, but just not anything special, especially for the money. Eclipse\\'s pizza crust is supposed to be something particularly special, but Black Rock Pizza\\'s is far superior by comparison. After this dining experience, my wife and I wished we had just spent $10 for 2 large 1 topping Little Ceasar\\'s pizzas. It would have been twice as good and filling at a third the price. Don\\'t bother with this place. It is more hype than substance. Not worth it at all.', \"Nasty place that smells like a 100 year old trailer that's been smoked in.....

I went inside and was told that there was no way they could see me as they were too busy. This was about 12 noon.  I was told I could come back later in the day.  When I returned to the car, the person at the air station said I will just fill up the tire, and it should be good for at least 2 days.  I had my wife bring the car back at about 4 pm and again she was told they were too busy, and she would have to come back tomorrow.\\n\\nIt is now 9 pm and I am waiting for roadside assistance as the front tire is completely flat.

The food is usually great and the staff is quick. HOWEVER, we went last night to celebrate my brothers graduation and ALL of our seafood dishes had rotten shrimp in them. My brother is not very food conscious but even he pointed out that the shrimp had a bad taste. My mom and I tasted the shrimp from all the seafood dishes and had to spit it out. She told the waiter and sent back a few pieces for the chef to try, only for the waiter to come out and say that the chef didn't taste anything wrong with it and the best he could do was take 20% off our bill. We weren't looking to get any discounts, we were simply trying to make the staff aware of the rotten shrimp. My mom was mostly concerned about the chef's judgement. She has been in the restaurant industry for decades and was appalled when the chef said he didn't taste what was wrong. Those of us with seafood lost our appetite and left with our plates still full of food. Money and time wasted. Not sure if we will be returning, such a shame considering this was a staple restaurant for us :(\", 'Great product, but horrible customer service online!  I live in New Orleans and brought my mother some pralines once on a trip home back to Maine.  She LOVED them and I started sending her boxes of pralines for Christmas, her birthday, even Mother\\'s Day.  The customer service in the actual Southern Candymakers stores on Decatur Street is awesome.  Over Christmas, the stores were busy so I ordered them off the website to be sent to her.  I sent her a 3 pound box and she was SO excited.  She told me last week, she needed more so I went on the website again and ordered her a 4 pound box.  I placed the order on 1/14 and paid $30 extra for 2 day shipping via Fex Ex.  The order wasn\\'t even sent out until the 16th and when she finally got them today, they were peanut butter flavored, which she does not like.  When I ordered, it said, \"You must choose a flavor\".  Original was the first choice and that\\'s what I checked off.  I called customer service, and the woman that I dealt with, Linda, should not be working with people.  She basically accused me of lying, saying there was no way that there could be a computer error when I ordered, even though the order info also said my mother lived in Gorham, Mississippi instead of Maine and my old phone number was on the order, which I had corrected..  I told her that I\\'ve been getting pralines from them for years and spending at least $100 every time.  She finally said if my mother sent them back (paying shipping out of her own pocket) they would send her the original.  I am so upset after being a loyal customer for 5 years that they I would be treated so poorly.

That's a big difference and don't expect them to explain why. The quality of the coffee is just meh. Taste like it's been watered down. The chai tea latte has no spice some days. The one thing I can never understand is the total lack respect for customers at this location. I mean after being charged 6.56 for a cup of Americano I don't want to listen to you complain about customers dropping king cake on the floor and arguing about who should clean it up. Do your job.

From the level of irritation of us walking in as the staff was just setting up (we walked in at 10:45am, the restaurant opens at 10:30am as posted on the website), for brunch, to the series of unreal circumstances that took place over the next hour, I am still in a state of shock.

I finally got up and went to the bar to ask the gentleman bartender for ketchup. Katie then retrieved two sides of ketchup for us. When I said thank you, her response was \"sure\".

I mentioned to one of the male members of the wait staff, that the leather sofa smelled and that they might want to wipe them down when the day was through. He said \"oh, really, I can\\'t tell, my sense of smell isn\\'t all that good\" and then \"we\\'ll make Katie take care of it\" as he walked over to Katie and another female to openly mock me for making a comment on the couch.

Second, delivery was ridiculously late, maybe being from NYC I have higher expectations so I\\'ll give them a pass on that...maybe.  Third and the final straw, the food was HORRIBLE!!!!! I don\\'t even understand how they felt that what they sent out was acceptable.  How does a Dominican restaurant screw the most basic thing-Rice.  It was stale and crunchy...and not in a bibimbap way....which I love but not with my chicken stew that was void of everything but chicken.

We literally walked into Sher-E-Punjab, were given a table, walked up to the buffet, looked at each other with agreeing shakes of the head, and walked straight out. The buffet presentation we looked at was simply not up to snuff. And this is despite our expectations being low to begin with, since I have eaten at Sher before and already know that it's a pretty underwhelming experience.\", 'My friend and I decided to have lunch at Mr. B\\'s on Memorial Day. The atmosphere is moderately upscale. Fortunately for us, there was no long line or crowd, so we got seated immediately. \\n\\nFor the most part the servers were nice, however our waitress could have improved her customer service etiquette.\\n \\nMy first issue with the waitress began after I asked her to clean the bread crumbs from the table ... (Side note: the bread is served from a bag, it\\'s light and crispy on the outside and airy  on the inside... It tastes good but easily crumbles) \\nThe waitress wiped the table but left a considerable amount of crumbs on the table ... Afterward, the waitress called me a \"neat freak\" , not once but twice ... The neat freak comment was completely inappropriate. \\n\\nSecond, the waitress was unfamiliar with the menu. She did not seem to know whether or not the shrimp in the various dishes was deveined. \\n\\nMy third issue was with waiting 40 minutes for the crab cake appetizer. One crab cake is $18. The crab cake was actually good and savory, but it was disappointing waiting 40 minutes for one crab cake ... \\n\\nOur main course arrived about 15 minute after the crab cake. \\n\\nI ordered the shrimp and angel hair pasta. The buttery taste overwhelmed the dish. Since the dish lacked acidity, I requested lemons from the waitress. The taste of the pasta was not a big deal ... Nothing a little lemon juice couldn\\'t fix. \\n\\nMy fourth issue was with the waitress bringing the small cut lemons from the bar, instead of lemon wedges ... \\n\\nThe lemon cuts were so small that I was unable to squeeze lemon juice from the lemons ...\\n\\nOverall, I wanted to enjoy Mr. B\\'s more than I did...

The food here overall is overpriced and crappy. The one thing I order [shrimp w/broccoli] is really hard to F up, but eating with other folks has shown me how hit or miss GC is.

After two ridiculously terrible visits, including hard boiled eggs on our Benedict's (twice).  I gave the remaining gift cards away.   We did go on both Saturday and Sunday mornings, so you can read that either way.  Either my bad for picking a busy time or theirs for not being able to handle it.  No third strike for me, this place is way, way overrated.\", \"I used to love Red Lobster but last night will probably be the last time I go; especially to the Fairview Heights location.  \\n\\nThe wait was horrendous.  We were told it would be about 45 minutes.  We checked back with the hostess after it was getting close to an hour and we were told it would be about 10 more minutes. Okay, it is a Saturday, still not bad, right?  Finally after waiting one hour and 45 minutes we were finally seated . . . . and after numerous people that came in after us were seated.  Everywhere on the internet it says Red Lobster restaurants don't take reservations/call ahead seating so my bad for not actually calling to make sure as apparently they now do.  Most restaurants won't book large parties on a Friday or Saturday evening or at least keep them to a limited number, especially between the 5 pm - 7 pm rush time because . . . it's a Friday or Saturday evening and they are already extra busy.  Not here - there were probably 3 or 4 large parties which I guess was the reason one family of five had to wait almost 2 hours!!  If they would have just told us upfront that it would be well over an hour wait, we would have never stayed.  Apparently that is what they tell everyone that walks in because they continually told people that came in after us it would be 45 minutes to an hour wait (they did add fifteen more minutes on!). Maybe the hostesses just need more training in figuring out semi-accurate wait times but I recognized them from previous visits and they've all worked there for years. This would lead you to believe they are just not honest with people in hopes of not turning customers away.  I totally get that it was a Saturday and expected to wait but not for almost two hours and not one full hour longer than what you said when we walked in.  That is by far unreasonable.  There were actually smaller parties that came in right after us (not call aheads either) that were seated, ate, and left before we were seated.  I guess a party between 4-8 throws them into a conundrum but they can handle smaller groups and those with over 10 with no problems.  I guess we were really the fools because once we were seated, there was hardly anyone left still waiting (many had already given up and left).  Honestly, we sat there patiently and only asked once nicely where we were in the wait.  Funny how a few people that we are pretty sure came in well after we did, but loudly pitched a fit about the wait were seated right after they complained!    \\n\\nNow to the food - menu selections seem smaller and prices are way too high for the size and quality of the food.  They've really just gone downhill over the years - the second biggest reason I won't go back.  The food was just average, if even that - let's face it, the Midwest typically overcooks seafood so it ends up tough and rubbery with little flavor.  The same can be said here.  The only thing that tasted excellent were the cheddar bay biscuits - still exceptional!     \\n\\nThe only saving grace to the evening was the great waiter.  I don't recall his name but he told us he was originally from Miami.  He was a very attentive waiter and was very friendly.  If I were only giving stars for his service, it would have been 4 or 5 stars for sure!\", \"First off let me start by saying this review doesn't reflect the taste by any means, because the burgers, tots and shakes are delicious. However, the service and the care for the customer are much less to be desired. This afternoon my wife took my two boys (3 and 17 months) out with a friend's family that's visiting from out of town. Naturally Burger Republic was the spot of choice since they wanted some great burgers. The trip quickly went downhill. My oldest has a pretty bad gluten allergy so they specifically requested the gluten free bun for his burger and let the waitress know. When the food came halfway through the bun they noticed that it was eerily similar to the rest of their regular buns. When they asked the waitress about it she then asked the kitchen staff and then informed my wife that the bun was in fact not gluten free and she was sorry about that. That to me is unacceptable. Although she apologized, nothing else was done after that to make the situation right. Now I have a son who's crying because his stomach isn't feeling well in between taking trips to the bathroom. If nothing else a manager should've been notified and/or the meal should've been comped. Luckily my son's allergy isn't as bad as some have it and he didn't have an immediate allergic reaction needing medical attention. Needless to say that supposedly great trip for out of town friends has now turned a days worth of fun activities into a day of back and forth bathroom visits and crying children. NOT COOL! Needless to say I can't in good conscience recommend Burger Republic any longer. Regardless of the great food, if they can't pay attention to the customer for something as easy as a gluten free bun request who's to say that the next time this happens there won't be serious consequences.\", \"I ordered corned beef hash and was very disappointed. Prior to ordering, I asked our waitress if the cafe makes their own corned beef and she said No, they buy it, cut it in the kitchen and make corned beef hash out of it. So I assumed that I will get real corned beef hash. After 30mins or so, the waitress came out with my corned beef hash looking like it came from a can - unless they use a blender to cut the corned beef, anyone will know the difference. I just wished that the staff are knowledgeable with the food that they are serving. This is not cheap breakfast and I don't mind ordering other things on the menu if I was properly informed.\", \"I had been to Rembrandt's once before. I agree with the over pricing and the crowded atmosphere that other people have mentioned.

We arrived at 10:50 am for brunch. Apparently the kitchen closes at 11:00am. We were unaware. We stood in line behind about 10 people for close to 5 minutes. At 10:56 the cashier angrily came over and announced the kitchens closes at 11:00 and they are cutting us off. No apology, not even any eye contact. She pointed to the person standing directly in front of me and said you are the last to be served. There was only 2 of us left. She wouldn't even accommodate 2 more people 5 minutes before the kitchen was closing. She, Rae as we later asked for her name, does not understand customer service. We had been patiently waiting and had arrived before the closing of the kitchen and she didn't even have the decency to apologize. She stomped away and was abrupt to ever person that came to her register next. We left without even ordering coffee.

Once I got up to the speaker I placed my order and was given my Total. When I finally made it to the Window, they asked what I ordered and told me that it looked like my order hadn't been entered. I gave them my order two more times then paid. When I was handed my Medium Iced Coffee (black) and Medium Iced Coffee with Milk and Carmel Swirl, it was very clear one of the drinks was incorrect. When I mentioned this to the girl in the window she proceeded to raise her voice at me and tell me the drink was in fact what I ordered. The Manager finally comes to the window to see what was happening. I calmly told him that I ordered a Medium Iced Coffee with Milk and Carmel Swirl and the drink I received was incorrect. The girl in the window began yelling that I had ordered an Iced Carmel Mocha. The Manager did remake my drink, but neither him or the girl in window apologized for yelling at me and telling me I didn't know what I ordered.\\n\\nNot ready to give up on this place, I went back this morning to get the same two drinks. Again they handed us a Carmel Mocha, and argued with my boyfriend when he said the drink was incorrect. He tried the drink that their request and when he insisted it was incorrect they continued to say it was in fact what he ordered. We eventually left with the incorrect drink because we were tired of arguing and needed to get to work.\\n\\nThis location needs to get it's act together and learn some Customer Service or it will permanently lose our business.\", \"Definitely the worst place I've had the pleasure of visiting.

Most of our orders were wrong and the waitress, bless her heart was trying to correct all the mistakes. The manager did speak to us and said it was a weird transition of shift change, which in all honesty is unacceptable.

We both tried the higher end restaurants inside the French quarter and wanted something more of where the locals go to for day to day meals. We patiently waited in line to get a table.

I get that she MAY have forgotten to put our name down, which is what she told her manager, a very nice gentleman by the way, but that does not forgive the fact that she smirked when we asked about the table on multiple occasions. It doesn't forgive that she deliberately sat everyone who came in before and AFTER us and kept telling us to wait. If I was the owner, I would have fired her on the spot. No matter how good the food may be, which we didn't even get a chance to try, because this racist hostess/waitress ruined our dinner plans, it's not worth our money to be treated like a second class citizen.

Unfortunately the person on the phone wouldn't accommodate a reservation for our party of 4. They only take reservations for large parties. Silly\", 'We were shocked to see the cheapest entree was 19 dollars because we looked at the menu beforehand and saw several options on the bar menu. We asked if we could order off that menu after sitting down and we were told it was \"against the rules.\" The food was ok and the portions were very small. The bar was full and the tables had ample seating. As we were leaving the hostess with braids asked us sarcastically if \"we had good food despite not being able to order a burger.\"  The whole experience rubbed me the wrong way. A bit too pretentious for a restaurant that has been open all of 1 month. If you get reservations and are craving a burger go ahead and cancel them and walk to the bar. Or go to any of the other exceptional options available in the area.', \"This place was recommended to us by a friend and oh my gosh was it terrible.

Scratching your head you ask \"how that could be?\" The answer, the cheese cost a 1.00 the bread 3.00 and so on. Shoot I\\'m surprised they didn\\'t charge for the egg too. To top it off the food tasted like s#$% ran over twice. I could cook a better breakfast if I was drunk on bourbon st. Honestly, service was crap, it took two hours for a Dennys breakfast and it was off a street I couldnt even find. LAME', \"The service gets extremely slow once the sun goes down.

Finally a waitress came over and got us a few drinks. The guys attempted 3 games of pool but the table was not working correctly and wouldn't release the cue ball. My brother wanted another drink and waited again for quite a bit at the bar while the waitress ignored him. Upon closing his tab and paying for cash, the waitress did not return his card to him which prompted a trip back in the morning.

I finally got up to the 7th floor where my room was, and when I opened the door thought I was walking into a giant ashtray. The hallways reeked, but I thought maybe the rooms would be better. They are not. You cannot open a window either, not even a crack, to emit fresh air. The AC itself was merrily blowing a nonstop stream of what appeared to be straight cigarette smoke. I shut it off completely. When I called down to the front desk I was treated rudely, and I informed them there was NO way I could stay 2 nights in the giant ashtray room. I\\'m now waiting to see if they charge me for the spa that I am also not going to be able to go to.  The room was also nasty and dirty. For your pleasure I snapped a couple of pictures.

We again asked if we could be seated at a different table, (the restaurant was not crowded, plenty of tables were available). She snapped back at us  \"this is only a restaurant\"..... excuse me.... I couldn\\'t believe how rude she was.  She snatched the menus off the table and walked away, we found our own table.

Not a \"Sorry for the wait\"\\n\\nWe ordered the Zuccini Frities, Chicken,Veal Parm. Food was all good. Bread was good.  We order the small portions. she screwed up the order- She brought us the regular sized ones.

I got 6 tiny shrimp 2 oysters 2 hush puppy\\'s and 1 stuffed shrimp. Very tiny \"platter \" for $30. Usually very full of food. Now the biggest problem was the service! 25 min to be greeted by waitress and 10 more min to actually get the drinks. Refills were given if you were lucky enough to flag somebody down. Very disappointed! She even had a trainer. Three times drinks empty over 10 min. I\\'m sure they won\\'t be there long if service does not improve!', 'Typically this was my favorite place for brunch. Anytime friends visit me - I\\'m adamant about coming here. After this visit I can say I won\\'t be back. The level of service we received was mediocre at best. I was also watching a short video clip on my phone and the server (who wasn\\'t my own) tapped our table and said \"do you mind turning that down?\" Actually it wasn\\'t that loud considering a DJ is playing music. Then he proceeds to make a \"snide\" comment to the table he was serving, \"I can\\'t even remember what I was going to say.\" Lastly, I ventured out of my normal routine and had the pork belly - didn\\'t enjoy at all.

The wings were ok, nothing special. But, here is the problem and we learned a lesson as we don't really look at bills for accuracy all the time. We had already had our card swiped and then I looked at the bill and thought it was pretty high for what we got. I saw that they had charged us 8.95 for the wings!

I ordered a chicken sandwich and my friend ordered the popular village burger. With my initial bite into my chicken sandwich, I knew something was wrong. The inside seemed tough and very hard to even cut with a knife, and I had my friend try it to confirm. My best guess would be they used frozen chicken but did not fully thaw it prior to cooking, therefore having a very hard middle! I quickly notified the server who sincerely apologized and I chose to go with a burger medium well. With the first bite into my burger, you could see a pool of blood oozing from it. Although I normally may order burgers medium rare or medium, I asked for medium well. The surprising thing was my friend ordered medium and his plate had not a trace of blood. \\n\\nDespite the establishment replacing my order quickly, which should be the standard protocol of any order that was messed up, I am highly annoyed/dissatisfied that I was not offered anything (free drink, the messed up order to be comped). \\n\\nI have been here several times and ALWAYS receive great food/service.

Personally I like the crab legs.  We took the family out this past weekend, and were severely disappointed.  At first it seemed like it was going to be a great experience with the family.  The salads came out, I had to ask about my bisque.  It finally arrived after the reset of the table had finished their salads.  While I was eating my bisque the food came out.  My wife and I ordered crab legs with two premium sides each, instead of the regular sides that came with it.  Big mistake, she kept asking if we wanted the corn and potatoes or the rice and broccoli.  We wanted neither, my wife wanted lobster mashed and I wanted the aspagaras and burbon sweet potatoes.  We received the crab legs and the rice.  We told the person who brought the food out that is not what we ordered.  After we finished the crab legs , the sides finally arrived.  The manager did comp my wifes meal, but not mine.  Did not care about the meal being comp'd, but service has really gone down hill.

Placed an order that said it would be delivered in 15-30 minutes. 30 minutes after the order was placed, I received a call saying my food wouldn't be delivered for two hours.

Went to the self-serve fountain drink area and what we wanted was not working, so we told a staff member.  After waiting for 40 minutes and no food, I got up and asked where it was.  The gal said she would check and I sat back down. She never came to tell us what the issue was, so I \"found her\" and asked.  She said, oh, they made your food with cheese so they are re-making it.  We told another staff member that the soda machine was not working for the drink that we wanted.  We watched MANY MANY people come and go before our food FINALLY arrived.  They sadly never did take the time to fix the fountain drink that was empty.  So we left very frustrated because of all the above.

Again waiter asks us if anything is needed. I thought we are just getting a good service. But again he comes again and ask anything is needed.  The lady manager comes to our table and ask if everything is ok!  Clearly she wanted us out, so she can have other people seated.  So we try to rush little bit so we can leave faster. Then our waiter comes back again, and this time ask us if we want out food to go! I was mad now, it was about 6:45 and we didn't even finish our dinner.  How can you ask customer if they want a doggy bag if they are still eating.   I understand people are waiting, but we just started to eat around 5:50 when food came out.

Today, I decided this to be my last visit to this place. The service staff and the cooking staff are not polite. They kept staring at me and my friends while eating. It worth mentioning that this is all you can eat restaurant; however, in order to make us feel full quickly, they decided to put a quantity of rice double the size of the sushi. When we left some rice, they decided to charge us for it. They were not polite by telling us you're ordering too much quantities and that's why we concluded that they put too much rice. The girls serving was talked to us in a rude way and one of them used her finger tips to point to us while talking. I will stop coming to this place again\", \"Just ate a teriyaki chicken lunch bowl that was terrible. The chicken was full of fat and loaded with teriyaki and the white rice was sticky.

The first time there was a party of 12 or more, so it was very noisy, but the food was good so we decided to try again. The second time, there was also a party of 12 or more and the noise was unbearable. It wasn't just the large party.  The owners have squeezed so many tables here it feels like dining on SEPTA during rush hour. Our table was the size of a hubcap and we were jammed into an alcove alongside a pair of students from University of the Arts. We now know every detail of the drama department's spring lineup.

Not sure why these places advertise plain wonton soup on their menus if all they serve is WOR wonton soup.

As a local resident, I've been there many times before, but last Friday was my last.\", 'BRIDES PLEASEEEEEEEEEE DON\\'T BOOK WITH THIS VENUE!! I booked with this venue in the beginning of my engagement after meeting with Pat. He spent the entire meeting discussing all the lovely renovations that would be done prior to our wedding taking place.  Pat said that the renovations would be done over the summer (well before my wedding would take place in June the following year).  A few months later (after little communication from my initial meeting with Pat) we had our food tasting.  The food tasting was an absolute disaster. From the food being disgusting and bland and tasting like high school cafeteria food, to receiving a $60 check afterwards because our mothers came.  We were completely livid.  But the icing on the cake was the zero renovations that still hadn\\'t been done, months after we paid the deposit. The very next day I left Pat a voicemail and sent him an email.  I\\'m a paralegal, so I\\'m extremely thorough and attentive to detail.  I emailed Pat all of my correspondences with Melissa showing that she never stated that I couldn\\'t bring our 2 freaking parents and asked for the full refund.  I also mentioned the renovations that he promised that clearly weren\\'t ever done.  Pat became a completely different person.  He said the food tasting was only for the bride and groom.  I explained that it was never stated in any paperwork that it was complimentary for just the two of us.  Our mothers paid for the wedding, and I don\\'t eat meat so I would like more than one person\\'s review of this food.  I also asked how can you charge for additional food, when you still presented us with one plate for everyone to share.  He said it\\'s their policy and no refund would be issued.  Then I asked about the renovations and why the venue looked exactly the same.  First, he acted as if he never made any promises about renovations, then after I kept asking several questions, he back tracked and said that it\\'s hard to get the licenses for renovations in the county.  So basically, no renovations would be done prior to my wedding.  At this point I was absolutely livid.  First if you are going to nickel and dime me now for freaking $60 then this is going to be a long process.  Second, I would have never ever booked with that venue based on how it looked.  Everything in the ballroom looked outdated, the carpet was dingy and old, and the venue as a whole looked old, and I literally had stopped looking at venues based off the lies Pat had told us. So, I told Pat that I was unhappy and would rather book somewhere else and that I wanted my deposit back.  Initially, he said no.  Then when I threatened legal action, he gave us our deposit back immediately.\\nTHE MORAL OF THE STORY IS DONT BOOK WITH PAXON HOLLOW. From Pat being a con artist, to Melissa they are just horrible and honestly seem as if they don\\'t fully comprehend customer service.  Two weeks after firing Paxon Hollow, I booked with Regal Ballroom and we just got married on June 10th.  They were literally the polar opposite of Paxon Hollow. Netty, and Chris were so amazing and attentive. The food at the food tasting was amazing, we were allowed to bring our moms, the entire venue was brand new and by the wedding day they had even made some tweaks to the bridal suite, we were able to keep the same date as before, had a million times better customer service, and paid a lot less then Paxon Hollow.  \\n\\nP.S. See Dan\\'s May 2017 review on wedding wire where he also outlines the poor customer service, the horrible food, and the \"renovations\" that Pat is promising to everyone', 'I want to like this place it\\'s so close to where I recently moved but after 3 times and trying 3 different dishes I am officially done.\\n\\nThe food in my opinion is over priced for what it is- I don\\'t mind paying a little more for above average food but this place doesn\\'t cut it.\\n\\nGot the fajita wrap and it was so greasy that the wrap was completely soggy and falling apart to the point where it was fell into pieces. The fajita was actually chopped up chicken (like you\\'d find in a chicken cheese steak). It was 9 dollars and absolutely not worth it- even to my ridiculously hungover want to eat something fatty and greasy self.\\n\\nNext time got another wrap- it came with fried chicken not grilled- okay my fault I should have specified but typically not used to getting fried chicken in a chicken wrap. Also flavorless and at 9 dollars not worth it at all. The honey mustard was gross, the chicken was over cooked and greasy.\\n\\nNext time- grilled chicken Apple walnut salad with mozzarella cheese. The mozzarella cheese was literally flavorless pizza cheese, the apples were completely rotten and mushy had to pick them out and toss them and the salad itself was wet so when the dressing was mixed in it was a watered down mess of a 10 salad. \\n\\nI give up on this place. Not to mention like others have said the owner is rude. I\\'ve asked questions such as \"does the Greek salad come with chicken\" and was answered condescendingly no it comes with feta. Um for 9 dollars without protein sorry thought I was missing something ?\\n\\nSkip this place is my suggestion I know I will be going the few extra blocks for more edible food that is less expensive.', 'I am sorry for one star. However, I read reviews before entering and thought that most were just being negative. Honestly, for what I just eat and paid for, McDonalds is better. Yes McDonalds. I got a Woodstock and fries. The bun was about the size of a double cheeseburger bun at McDonalds, The meat really didn\\'t have a taste to it, the bacon tasted like it was deep fried in two week old grease, and the fries seemed like were warmed up in the microwave. The \"homemade\" ketchup, not good either. Now, on to the service, I know these waitress\\'s make low hourly wage and depend on tips, however, to get a tip you have to take care of your customers. I had to ask for coke, even though she walked by twice and looked at my empty glass ( I had already drank the melted ice) the third time she walked by I had to ask her even though she looked at the empty glass to bring me a coke. Then I asked for mayo Joe she said ok and then waited on another table. Maybe its just me but...The only smile I got was when I was leaving and then I bet she didn\\'t smile when she picked up the receipt. I will not come back. And take heave, don\\'t be like me. I am sorry for the long review, and I hope you have a great day.', \"Don't be surprised if the manager makes you out to be a liar. Tried to get a table after a hockey game for a table of 4. Once we did not get seated, I asked why open seated began when we were on list. He said they seated everyone on the list and acted like I was lying. He then proceeded to walk away. I manage a business and that's not how you treat any customer. How about asking when we put our name in or who did we tell at the hostess stand??? Really surprised by how we were treated. Never been treated so poorly by any business!!\", \"So I'll start with a couple of positives. I loved the bacon bucket, nice TV's, and ok beer.  That said, the service is pretty bad. In my opinion a place that has multiple beers should have a menu that people can look at and not a TV screen that scrolls through. I respect the conservation of paper and all put printing a few menus isn't a bad idea! Also note to Danny boy.. Maybe the service would be better if he staff didn't drink more than the patrons.\", \"This review is directed at Bully's as a whole rather than a specific restaurant.

When I asked the waitress about St. Patty Day specials or Corned Beef and Cabbage I was told that Bully's corporate will not allow Bully's restaurants to celebrate St. Patrick's Day......

Unfortunately I was thoroughly disappointed. My girlfriend ordered the Chicken Milanese entree and was shocked when a flat piece of fried chicken came out with a little potato salad on top instead of the beautifully described entree on the menu. Not what you would expect for the $24 price tag! Our friends both ordered the Seafood Risotto and were also pretty disappointed. We were embarrassed that this was their first impression of dining in St. Pete.  It was a shame to spend $120 dollars for four ppl on just food and no alcohol and not be wow'd to say the least.

He seemed unfazed. The food came out and we had all lost our appetites. When the check came they had taken 10% off the bill. The manager stated that they need to get a new exterminator. Ya think?

While we were waiting for the table to be cleaned, a group of 3 came in and the hostess sat them at the table for 6!!! WTF!!! We finally sat down and ordered right away. We waited a very long time to get our food, the group of 3 at the 6 table got their food quickly, and so did a couple of tables who ordered after us! When the food finally came, they gave me the wrong quiche. I ordered the special, florentine. The waitress didn't notice that it was not what I ordered and went to fix it, but then she said they were out of the special. I looked over at a few of the tables that got their food before us, and ordered after us, they had 3 slices of Florentine quiche. Again WTF!!!! So then I asked why they were able to get what they ordered, when we ordered before them... She just said that our table had a sandwich that took longer than theirs! Really! So I just kept the shecrab soup. Which use to be amazing, but now it has a gravy consistency! Yuck! We were all very disappointed with the service! And the food is not up to par like it used to be.

The following week I called Pizza Guys to place my order.  Prior to placing my order, I informed the girl of my arrangement with Adam.  She responded with \"Hmmm... hold on and let me figure that out\".  Adam came to the phone and when I reminded him of our arrangement, he took my order (which was the exact same order as the one they messed up on), he told me that the total was $88!  When I reminded him again of our agreement, he then stated that he can \"discount my order significantly\" bringing it down to $60.  I told him that I was not satisfied with that.  If I had them correct the order the first time, I would not have paid for their error then, so why should I pay for it this time?  Adam told me that was the best he can do... even as a manager!  I asked who his boss was and he stated that she was standing right next to him.  I asked to speak with her. He placed me on hold for about five minutes only to return and say that she sent him back to the phone and tell me that the best she can do was to bring the cost down to $55. Come to find out that this was the OWNER! She did not even have the decency nor respect to come to the phone and talk to me.  Instead of trying to correct their error, they acted as if I was just trying to get some free food! I have NEVER been so insulted nor experienced such poor customer service!  I will NEVER order from this location EVER again!  I even spoke with Director of Operations regarding the issue and although he apologized and asked for another chance, I told him that I would not feel comfortable nor would I put it past that staff to put something in my food!  In my opinion, customer service is just as important as the quality of food I am purchasing.  Again - I will NEVER order from this location again, and if you think that customer service is just as important as I do, then you won\\'t order from them either!', \"Horrible service everytime. I have to teach the employees how to make a proper acai bowl. They obviously can't keep or train employees.\", 'We went on a Friday night. The service was horrible!  We were the only ones in the dining are and it took 15 minutes to have the waiter to place our order.  The waiter mumbled and never asked us what spice/heat level we wanted our food.  Well what we received was bland, bland, bland! When we asked to take our food home.  The waiter just gave us the plastic containers and walked away.  Never asked if he could pack for us or took the food to the back to pack it.   We have eaten Indian in West Philly to Singapore.  I have never seen the lack of level of attention.  Save your $65.', 'Biggest piece of tasteless pizza. How do they do it?  Crust -- tasteless. Cheese -- tasteless. Sauce -- tasteless. What a waste of calories!   Once is plenty for me. Not going back. So many other choices here in the borough.  Much improvement needed for a $3.50 slice of plain.', 'This is the first restaurant review I have ever written but, this place was such a disappointment that I would like to save someone else from wasting their money and time on Ho Ho\\'s like we did. First, I will start off with the positive. The Crab Rangoon was good and they were large. Sadly, that is the only nice thing I have to say. We ordered our food and the person I was with ordered extra pork with his fried rice and asked how much the extra pork cost and how much pork would he get. The young lady\\'s response was, \"not very much\". He made a circle with his hand and asked if that was how much or more and she looked horrified and continued to say, \"not very much\". He went ahead and ordered it with an extra cost of $2.00 which is (2) extra portions of pork. There were 3 dirty bikes and 2 filthy high chairs in the VERY dated dining room. We pulled our chairs out and they were so dirty our hands were sticking to the chairs. We noticed the packets of sugar were from Ameristar and the sugar free packets were from another restaurant. Our drinks came in cracked plastic cups that still had the price tag sticker on the bottoms of them and the ice was out of a regular freezer and you could taste that it was old ice. It took forever to get our food. He ordered a Pork St. Paul Sandwich which came on the tiniest slices of bread with very old, dry pork. Until then, I thought all bread slices were the same size. I ordered Chicken Lo Mein and the chicken was horrible! It didn\\'t even taste like chicken.The lo mein was spaghetti and there was so much soy sauce that it was soup. I asked for red sweet and sour sauce and the girl brought it out in and old honey container and the container was very sticky. Not from the sweet and sour spilling on it but, it was as if it had been sitting on a shelf by a fryer. There were big chunks of something in it. Finally, the person I was with got their fried rice to go that was supposed to have 2 extra servings of pork yet, it still fit into the usual small container and there was no extra pork. At that point, we just wanted out of there. I have been disappointed in restaurants but, this place made me angry. It was a COMPLETE waste of money and they obviously take no pride in the making of their food. The quality of the food or experience very clearly means nothing to the owners of this restaurant. If you see it-KEEP DRIVING!!!!!!', \"I was told Waffle House was the IHOP of the south. After this visit, I think I'll stick to IHOP.\\n\\nWe went in the early evening for breakfast for dinner, we were the only customers at that time, which we thought was good as we'd get a lot of attention. We were wrong. We sat down to a dirty table, our waitress was barely paying attention to us, and when it came to paying the bill, we had to get up and go to her after multiple tries at calling her over. \\n\\nFood wise. I ordered the All-Star Special that came with two eggs, toast, hash brown, waffle, and your choice of sides(bacon, always). The waffle was thin but nice and the bacon was crisp. The rest were just tasteless. Toast was more like warm bread, eggs weren't cooked all the way, and the hash brown had a dirty taste to it that I couldn't eat more than a single bite. \\n\\nSeating right near the kitchen also, you'd think they would keep it clean to keep up appearances. The place was a mess with dirty dishes everywhere and old food sitting around. It made me really regret eating here.\\n\\nAll in all, I will never visit Waffle House again. The establishment was dirty, the majority of the food was horrid, and the service was basically non-existent. Next time I want breakfast for dinner, IHOP will be getting my money.\", 'So, the customer service was lacking and the wait time was unreal! They screwed up my order (my daughters was as she ordered) then tried to charge me the full amount for another one! \"I said, so you\\'re going to charge me for another one? He said, no my bad, but it\\'s going to be an additional $2\" So they screwed up and still charged me. I basically spent $19 for 2 acai bowls that weren\\'t that great at all.

After an extremely long wait to be seated as usual, your told 15minutes that could easily turn into an hour and that\\'s just the appetizer. My girlfriend and I are finally  seated, and I notice the waitress is giving my girlfriend plenty of eye contact as we place our order and giving me very little to none  like I was  a freakin ghost very unprofessional and I\\'m thinking\" what\\'s up with that\" this is the first course. Right now already not feeling this place. Anyway, I ordered the jerk wings with the waffles. HORRIBLE ass salty caked on jerk like paste they use for the wings the waffles were good but those wings could\\'ve found more of a home in the trash. That was the icing on the cake for me. Had to even ask for more napkins from the waitress as she proceeded to look as she was rationing them out. They give you one silly paper napkin and I guess that supposed to hold you. At the end of our luxurious meal I told the waitress the wings are way too salty, she looked disappointed as if she personally made them. She asked if I wanted something else \"right know I\\'m really disgusted \" I said no just bring the check. My girlfriend said she would take them and maybe scrape some of the brine off they should be okay.What ever.... The waitress still looking like she was very disappointed. Oh well.... I see why Gordon Ramsey stays so angry at some of these restaurants. Because they really don\\'t know what they are doing.If people are so hyped about this place I want to know what they are ordering please post. Maybe the cook didn\\'t feel like cooking today.

Cashier at beer garden refused to ring out my other three items even though other cashiers have done it there before. When I asked if I am expected to go get in another line she said yes I guess so. Needless to say I cashed out my other three items and did not buy the beer from them.

Even the salad was covered in salt.', 'Decided to try the lunch buffet here after not having eaten at a Godfathers in about 12 years and was sadly disappointed, the pizza was fine but the salad was soggy and we felt rushed even though it was not busy.

I ordered a Bloody Mary from the less than friendly bartender. My wife ACCIDENTALLY knocked it over. Resulting in it spilling all over her and I and on there floor. You would have thought we threw it on the ground by the rude reaction of the manger and the bartender. Then the bartender asks me if i wanted another which I replied yes please. Once she made the drink she put it down and says rudely \" I hope you are more careful this time\". Like we wanted to ruin our clothes.

After ordering online, arrived at the store on time, waiting for five minutes for someone to come out, I had to call the store twice for someone to finally come out.

We sat down in a very packed Tony Romas on a Saturday afternoon and we waited and waited for a server to come by. The place was really busy so we sort of understood, but it got to the point where we almost got up and left.\\n\\nFinally, a very angry server stomped up and asked what we wanted to drink. No hello, no sorry, no eye contact. It was super uncomfortable. She pretty much forced us to make a decision on the spot about what we wanted to eat and after we ordered, she avoided us like the plague.\\n\\nShe had one large table half filled with kids and one of them asked for another milkshake. She was holding a bunch of dirty dishes and as he asked for the refill, she stormed over to the drink area right behind our table and THREW the dishes into the sink. It was so loud and it startled me. I can\\'t imagine how the kids felt. How embarrassing.\\n\\nAfter a mediocre meal and continued empty glasses we asked for the cheque- and the manager. All of a sudden, she was nice and said she would be happy to grab the manager for us.\\n\\nAnother server came up to the table and said that the manager was just on a phone call and she was a senior server and could talk to us. I was not buying it. I had seen the two servers chatting at some point during our horrible meal and assumed they were friends and she was now covering her friends butt.\\n\\nNevertheless, I told the problem to her in detail and she apologized. That was about it. No discount, no \"please come back\", no accountability.\\n\\nThe worst part about it was when we were walking to our car, we saw the manager standing outside with a group of servers smoking. \"On a phone call\"?\\n\\nRight.\\n\\nThis place definitely lost our business.', 'Worst brunch I have ever had!!! Waited one hour and ten minutes for our food. Our server said that they forgot to fix one of our orders so my food stayed in the window until they fixed the other plate.

Dinner came but no appetizers and she apologized and stated she forgot to put them in and would do so but we declined as our meals were already here. I ordered my granddaughter grilled cheese with apple slices and she received applesauce . Food was very bland , ordered the chicken special with\\nStuffing , mashed potato and vegetable. Chicken had so many small bones throughout I stopped eating it . Stuffing was so greasy and tasteless, mashed potato was cold. Service was lousy, food was lousy and place was dirty and smelled strongly of mildew . Will never return .', 'Very poor quality as a hotel restaurant.  \\nWe eat at a hotel restaurant even its food is mediocre and everything is overpriced, because we expect to be treated really nicely by well trained staff.  Well, the experience at this hotel restaurant was very unique.  We (five of us) stayed at the Hotel Monaco to celebrate my birthday, and reserved Red Owl Tavern based on many good reviews.  When we arrived at the tavern, we were taken to a table for four.  We told the gentleman that we were a party of five and we had a reservation.  He told us that he would bring a chair.  So, one of us sat on a chair that was placed in an aisle.  We then saw the area in the back where a group of five or so just left.  So we asked if we could move there.  The waitress told us that those tables were reserved.  I told her that we too \"reserved\" a table for five not four, and it was my birthday.  She told me that she would \"see what she could do.\"  Soon, a lady came to our table and said, \"Those tables are reserved.\"  I told her that we had made a reservation for five.  She said, \"Sorry, this is only what we have\" and patted on my shoulder and left.  My husband was upset, but I said it was OK.  I decided not to let this ruin my birthday.  After that, however, few things went right. They brought pasta with cheese even though I asked the waitress no cheese due to my daughter\\'s allergy.  So, my very hungry daughter had to wait another 20 minutes for her pasta with no cheese.  We had to ask why the bread, the side, and my father\\'s dish were so late when other dishes were already at the table.  When the bread came after a long wait, it had butter on it despite the fact we told the waitress my daughter was allergic to dairy.  My 81 year old father\\'s dish (Caesar salad with chicken) finally came after everyone finished their food which was more than an hour after we ordered all the food.  While all these things happening, we saw the area we had hoped to move in order to have more room which was \"reserved\" completely empty.  Toward the end of the meal, a couple of people were seated at one of the empty tables.  Our waitress was very apologetic.  She was never rude.  She took the pasta, Caesar salad, bread, off the bill, which was nice.  Would I like to dine at Red Owl Tavern again to deal with all the stress, especially for a special occasion like a birthday?  Absolutely not.  I hope the general manager of the Hotel Monaco (Mr. James Adamson) will make more effort to train people at the restaurant at the Hotel.', \"Just grabbed a beer - was going to have a snack but the person next to me was doing business and every other word was F _ck!!  Now I used that word often -- has a great ring to it and it's one of my favorite words ... drives the pint home quite well . However they were a little over the top and the bartenders fell into it encouraging the discussion- lots of loud trash talking -- Happy Hour Prices upstairs but not at the main bar - didn't tell me but shared with other customers that came in after me. Disappointing at best.\", '**want to clarify it wasn\\'t the food that made him sick, he had the flu**\\n\\nI\\'ve been here many times and always had a pleasant experience. However,  I went here over the weekend with my boyfriend. while we were there he started feeling very bad (he ended up having the flu). He tried using the bathroom but it was locked. He had to basically run from the back to the front of the restaurant to make it out the front door. He got sick right outside. He was extremely embarrassed but did not have any other options. A woman who worked there proceeded to walk out and yell at him as if he did it on purpose. He was so mortified that he just left. After a text from him, I asked for the check and headed to checkout. This is where I headed to the register to find the entire staff laughing at his expense. when I let them know that I was with him the woman ringing me up said- \"well why didn\\'t he try to go into the bathroom?\" I let her know that it wasnt\\' available. Another girl even implied that he did it on purpose. I was then asked by my server \"well I hope last night was fun, was it worth it?\" - I let the entire staff know that he was not in fact, hungover, but actually quite sick. Although it was embarrassing for the both of us, and inconvenient for the restaurant, they are in the hospitality industry and probably shouldn\\'t have yelled at one of their customers for being sick. They also shouldn\\'t have assumed that he was drunk/hungover. And speaking about him infront of everyone, not knowing that I was with him was extremely rude.\\n\\nI have always raved about this place. But i am so put off by their behavior over the weekend that I wont be returning and don\\'t intend on ever telling anyone else to go here. while I do apologize to them for the unfortunate incident that happened at the restaurant, I do believe that their behavior was absolutely unacceptable.', \"The food seemed re-heated from a microwave and the manager on duty is not very personable.

He accused me of getting \"feisty\" with him. I asked for my money back and he apologized to the person behind me (who\\'s order they bumped in front of mine) for the wait while he processed my return.

Despite the pools not being open when they say they are, the restaurants being more expensive than those in airports and with mediocre food at best, being kicked out of the pizza place they had inside 10 minutes before closing and our room had an amazing view of dumpsters with the glorious rolling landscape of a parking lot, it was a nice place! The only saving grace were the gardens themselves. But you can view them without having to pay for a room! \\n\\nNow for the really fun part: Contacting Marriott Customer Care about the horrible visit. (The hotel won\\'t call you back otherwise.) Customer Care advised me they would forward my grievance to the hotel and I should expect a response in 3-5 business days. I forwarded everything I could think of including my original reservation, costs, incorrect information and of course the issues we had while staying there. \\n\\nI was eventually contacted by a Heather Gates who is the Assistant Front End Manager. She informed me she was sorry for the way we were treated but they would not do anything to rectify the bill. That\\'s the way it was. I contacted Marriott Customer Care again and copied Heather on this email. I was then phoned by John Bennefield, the Front End Manager who informed me the exact same thing as Heather \"Sorry, but you\\'re stuck with that bill.\" Furthermore he refused to give me the hotel manager\\'s name, phone or email. Instead I was informed of his 15 years with the company and this was his 8th hotel! From working in a large company, when someone was transferred so frequently, we called it \"Passing the Trash\". It definitely wasn\\'t due to pride of service. John was exceptionally rude and went on to belittle me for making such a huge deal and contacting customer care over a mere $300. To me, that\\'s reasonably substantial. I was also informed directly that \"The Marriott considers this matter closed. It ends here and there\\'s nothing more anyone will do.\" I had asked for the hotel managers number, name or email to which he told me \"you can find it online\".', \"I won't be going back after noticing the wonton soup tasted like fish (how?) and the chicken was extremely hard to chew (must have been left out). 24 hours later, food poisoning for 2 days.

When I asked her to reduce it because of the service, she turned her back on me and walked away. It was the rudest treatment I have ever received in New Orleans.

Cornbread = dry; cabbage = too peppery (let folks add their own pepper if they want it instead of the whole batch); yams = not enough flavor; baked chicken = tasted like 3-day old food. I paid a whopping $15.00!  It's hard to find good soul food in Lou that's affordable.

Ate one and started to eat the next but the remaining pieces were just fat and gristle. Complained to the server and was told the dinner would be taken off our bill but we had to pay for the sides. So how exactly did the \"sides\" almost cost as much as the dinner???? they took off $1.99. Bitched and they took off another 10%. Still NOT WORTH IT!!!. And all they said was sorry but it\\'s our policy. Yes go ahead and laugh..... we are Seniors and eat in a lot of diners.

It's basically a greasy McDonald's.\", 'Went here again and was disappointed even more this time.

First off they changed the restrooms to unisex and they are equally dirty. The tables in this place need a good scrubbing because a simple wiping would not get them clean. Everyone working in this place appeared to be under the age of 21 and didn't seem to care about anything. The food was subpar and yet they have the nerve to charge 18 dollars for it.

She promptly told me that the patio was closed due to a large party renting it out. Not 5 minutes later they seated a table of 3 at one of the 5 empty tables out there. Needless to say I was pretty upset about being blatantly lied to. After another 20 minutes of standing around we were finally seated. The building is visually appealing inside however it was so loud we couldn't even hear each other. My girlfriend ordered the A.M. Chile Relleno, and I ordered the tri tip sliders. We also ordered a french toast to split. The french toast was delicious, the tri tip sliders had no salt what so ever. And my girlfriends dish was absolutely cold. She ended up sending it back. They prepared a new one for her which also contained all but one morsel of salt. They did however take half off her dish for their incompetence.

The only price we saw on the bill was a $180 smack in the middle. They said it was $150 minimum charge and they tacked on 20% tips to it when they did not deserve one penny. They could have told us the minimum charge at the beginning and tell us we should order more to reach $150, but they decided not to. They didn't say anything, they didn't allow us to get anything else too. They made us pay TWICE the amount we should have paid. They were so rude after we paid the bill.

The spot was no where near where the bread had been sliced, and the color was more blue than green. It took a brief discussion with our server to have the sandwich removed from the check.

And let me also point out, that of all of the many Mexican restaurants in the Fountain Square area, they were by far the least crowded that night. \\n\\nOkay so with that out-of-the-way, my wife and I walked in, walked through the front area, through the middle bar, to the back outdoor tiki bar area.

We were encouraged, but we probably should have listened to the couple next to us who told us they sure hope we weren't planning on eating there, because they had been there for an hour and were still waiting on their food.  We were approached almost immedietly by a server who took our drink orders.  That had to be a good sign, right!  Well, our drinks took about 20 mins..ok so it's Cinco de Mayo, no big deal.  We figured we had better get our food order in.  Pretty simple order, chips and questo, and two tacos each.  Nothing special.  After about 45 mins and no sign of even our chips, I walked up to bar in front area and ordered chips and queso and 2 more drinks.  He got that all for me in about 5 mins.  I asked him if I could order a couple of tacos and he told me the kitchen was closed.

We tried the bowls at the Juice Merchant but thought they were just okay, so we were excited when Boostin' Bowls opened up in Manayunk.  We tried both the Boostin' and the PB&J bowls.  The acai they use is a puree that comes from a box and blended with ice, so after a few minutes of eating, the entire bowl becomes a bland, watery mess with very little taste (or the benefits!) of actual acai.  Even though it cost us over $25, we ended up throwing half of it away and went somewhere else for breakfast.  Not sure where they learned to make acai bowls, but I don't think you're supposed to blend ice with the acai.  We make far better bowls at home with the frozen acai packs you can get from Whole Foods.

Entrees come out  (which were pretty good) and we finished them.  the waitress never not once came over and asked us how are we, did we need anything, she basically never came to check on us.  when she finally came over we asked for boxes  because we couldn't eat the rest of the food.  she brought us the boxes and left.  for another 15 minutes before we flagged her down and asked her for the check.  (which she should of brought when she gave us the boxes).  (STRIKE THREE)\\n\\n**oh did I mention that it wasn't crowded?  so there was no need for the POOR customer service.\\n\\n\\nbottom line -- the FOOD here is GREAT,  but the customer service SUCKS ASS BIG TIME.  The waitress we had was very lazy, unprofessional, and act like she was intimidated by us.  My company does a lot of business with sports bars in Philadelphia and because of last night I will have them reconsider their relationship with CHICKIE and PETES.\\n\\nI will take GREAT customer service with mediocre food ANY DAY -- over POOR customer service and GREAT food..\", \"I've came here a few times and the last 2 times my order have been incorrect.

The line extended to the door. \\n\\nI could see in the kitchen they were slowly cooking a couple items, and frying a small basket of hash browns. With the number of people in line they should have had a double order of everything on the grill and been hustling to get it all done. \\n\\nIt took 10 minutes just to get to the cashier and place my order. Then I stood against a wall and waited another 10. I watched 6 people who were behind me in line get their food first. When I finally asked if they\\'d skipped me they said \"no your order is almost ready.\" But there was no reason mine should have taken longer. They were just apathetic, half asleep and verging on mean with their annoyance at customers who didn\\'t come when their number was called. \\n\\nAfter all that, the sandwiches were sloppily put together, egg hanging out the sides, and wrapped with the inside of the wrapper on the outside. \\n\\nSo if by posting this I can get even ONE person to avoid this place, I will feel I\\'ve done my job.', \"Absolutely ridiculous.

Instead got 8 ounces in a plastic cup. Last time going there.\", 'For all I\\'m about to say, I feel I have to mention again that this is an honest review and I\\'m not even embellishing much on my experience here. I\\'ll give them two stars. \\n\\nOne extra star because they did something I can appreciate out here in the middle of the USA. They didn\\'t try to charge me $8 for a simple Vietnamese sandwich. You guys HAVE to understand that these bAnh mi sandwiches are a DOLLAR in Asia!!! They are $2-3 dollars in California but for some dang reason they are $5-8 in the heart of the USA. I ate it up gratefully and happily. It wasn\\'t as good as the last bAnh mi I had which was in SE Asia (mystery meat and questionable cleanliness standards but soooo dang tasty and I felt fine after eating it), but it hit my craving spot like a hammer.\\n\\nAlong with a bAnh mi was an order of goi cuon (spring rolls). The rolls were pretty small and the dipping sauce was crap. I\\'m sorry for not sugar coating, but it was absolutely crap. Like I tasted it and was like, \"dude wtf is this?!?!\" It was bland, and the strangest color I\\'ve ever seen in a goi cuon dipping sauce. It was like a light grayish brown with a less than creamy little bit more watery than creamy diarrhea texture. It was a very stupid dipping sauce. If people in Indiana say, \"I hate Vietnamese food.\" I would first blame this restaurant as the prime culprit. I would rebut with, \"did you, by chance, eat at Saigon Restaurant?\" If this was someone\\'s sole venture into Vietnamese food, I plead for them to try somewhere better and give it another try.\\n\\nThe next dish up... hu tieu bo kho. Beef stew with noodles. The beef was nice and tender and there were some great bits of tendon and carrot, but seriously... no real bo kho looks like what we were served. The broth should be a rich dark brown with a bit of orange oil highlighting the surface. This just looked like very dirty Pho broth. This is not the beef stew you serve to dip bread in. I feel like I was being served counterfeit Vietnamese food. I think that\\'s why I\\'m not happy writing this review. \\n\\nFortunately there seems to be some competition in Indianapolis for viet restaurants though. I hope that puts some fire in the competition and makes for better quality authentic Viet grub. If restaurants like this one is killing the first impression to the Indiana market, there may be no coming back!\\n\\nIt gets worse. The viet iced coffee tasted like soap. I cannot explain it. Did they not rinse the glasses throughly? Perhaps it was the viet coffee press that still had dish soap in it? What happened there? It was nasty.\\n\\nIt gets worse. I\\'ve been around. I\\'ve lived in a single bedroom apartment with a family of six with a billion cockroaches as a child. I\\'ve lived in cheap motel rooms with roaches and the smell of bug spray in the sheets. I\\'ve eaten whole meals in other countries with cockroaches crawling up the wall. But for some reason this kinda irked me... I saw our waiter at the counter visually tracking a bug on the counter. Then swat at it with his hand. Then move things around a bit and try to kill it again. In my mind I imagined a cockroach was his victim. I watched and watched... but did not notice any washing of hands after that hunting trip. Why were there no towels drying off his hands within the next five minutes? Why did his hands not seem moist at any time between this occurring and him serving our food? Like I said, I\\'m used to bugs, I don\\'t like them and they still gross me out, but I can convince myself some stuff is okay... but why not wash your hands bro? Take some of that extra soap that was in my coffee and give it a go... I\\'d really appreciate it a lot. I\\'m sure the health department would as would the customers! It wouldn\\'t take much more time out of your day.\\n\\nI came to Indianapolis in search of good Asian food that would solve a series of cravings. I\\'ll keep looking.

The server did not come to our table for 20 minutes. In the course of that time, we were greeted by a multitude of mice. There were 5 separate appearances. Including under our table and at our feet. We also watched them roam freely into and out from the kitchen.  I used to partake in Honey's brunch nearly every weekend. For YEARS. It is safe to say I will never dine or advertise for this establishment again. When the server was told about the mice issue, he was not only flippant in his response, but made excuses rather than apologize, and charged us for our 2 cups of coffee.\", \"I don't know why you people are all here lying to people.

It\\'s not mixed.\" He replied \"So you can see what you are paying for.\"\\n\\nI proceeded to pour the blackberry syrup into my tall margarita cup. It pooled on top of the drink and would not thoroughly blend with the rest of the drink. I asked the bartender if I could have a cup so I could mix the drink by pouring it back and forth between cups. Instead of offering to mix the drink himself, or providing me a spoon instead of a flimsy straw to mix my drink, he handed me a styrofoam cup.\\n\\nThere were two male customers on either side of me, they were audibly sympathizing with me and making comments about having to mix my own drink.\\n\\nIn retrospect, I should have asked to see the menu so I could point out that it said Flavored Margaritas were $8.50, and didn\\'t say \"Strawberry only.\" But at a crowded bar with people waiting behind me to be served, I didn\\'t want to cause a scene.\\n\\nInstead, I will vote with my feet and my wallet, and avoid Superior Grill and their lazy, apathetic, misinformed bartenders.', 'I\\'m not quite sure if these are in new customer relations handbook:\\n\\nRolling eyes when you walk into a empty restaurant because it forces you to work.

I travel for a living and have eaten at Mellow Mushroom all over the country, the Brandon location has a different taste and look than anywhere else. It is always very sparse with the toppings, compared with all the other locations.  When you have four different toppings on a pizza and can take 2 to 3 bites without biting into any ingredient, then something is wrong! The jerk chicken barely has any spice on it,  to the point where you can't even taste the spice. The last three times I have gone they have completely gotten the order wrong. The last time was for my birthday and we live an hour away. When they got it wrong the waitress very reluctantly took it back and have them fix another one. It's like she made me feel guilty for them messing it up. Then I went today on the way home, and they didn't put the sun-dried tomato on it. The clock actually argued with me that it was on there when I told him to pointed out, he said it was under the cheese. So I then proceeded to peel all the cheese back and it was not there. He again gave me attitude for putting on something that I had already paid for. I am convinced that the owner of this location purposely scrimps on the ingredients to save money.

First time in Nashville so we wanted to see what the downtown experience was, and we were greatly disappointed; mostly due to our unfortunate experience at tavern.  We waited for 20 minutes without any acknowledgement from our waiter.  When we finally saw him in our area he greeted a table who had just arrived, skipped our table and went on to another.

Our waitress brought both decaf and regular. When we pointed out the confusion, in a very understanding way (really making sure that she knew that we totally see how the confusion had occurred). This lady got angry! Left me speaking half way through and gave me her back, she came back with another thing of regular coffee, and started to bang our silverware on the table with a face of complete discontent. \\n\\nShe didn\\'t provide a straw for a tea, and there was another waitress near by. Not wanting to upset our waitress even more my brother\\'s fiancee asked this other waitress for a straw.

I don\\'t know if there\\'s some sort of racial issue in New Orleans between these two races, but it just seemed that there was a lot of aggression for things that are pretty normal at a restaurant. \\n\\nWe said we wanted to leave and asked for the check and the manager. The manager came, and asked us what the situation was. Our waitress had these threatening eyes on us the entire time, and the manager asked her to step aside, at which point the waitress started raising her voice. We said to the manager: \"this attitude is precisely why we want to pay and leave now and handed her $20dlls without looking at the bill (but we had asked for 2 coffees, 1 tea, water, and 2 diet cokes, a lot less than $20). I was expecting for an apology and to let us go without pay since we had barely touched our drinks. However, she took our $20dlls. and left the table. All the while three people with long hair peaked from the kitchen staring us also in a very threatening way. It was actually very scary. When the manager picked up our $20dlls we didn\\'t wait for the change and left the table.

To cap it off though when we finish eating. We waited not five but ten minutes to get our checks. After she finally decided to bring the checks. Jessica brought a check not three checks.

We stopped at the Pic-A-Lilli on Rt. 206 and it was packed shoulder to shoulder.  So we decided to go to La Campagnola instead, just before five o\\'clock.  It was really kind of empty at that time.  I read on the bill board outside that they offer an early bird special until 5:30.  We sat at the bar and the tall skinny young bartender, that plays college volleyball and looks like Clarke Kent (I don\\'t know his name) hands us menu\\'s.  I had to ask for the Early Bird Menu, it wasn\\'t automatic.  I ordered the Fettuccine Campagnola which was a white cream sauce with peas and small cubes of prosciutto, it also came with, \"soup, salad and my choice of two desserts.\"  I ordered the seafood bisque for my soup and wanted a house salad and a cannoli for my dessert.  The bartender says, \"it is soup OR salad\" and i explained that there was a comma in between the words \\'soup, salad\\' and not and \\'OR\\'!  I told him i wanted soup AND salad.  Remember I walked through the woods so at that point in the day I was starving!  I ordered a beer while i was waiting and the soup came out.  It was just ok...nothing too great, no real hunks of seafood.  Then I expected for my salad to come out and instead the pasta dish comes out....so I ask, \"where is my salad?\" and the bartender responds AGAIN, \"it is soup OR salad\" as if i am mentally disabled.  I said, \"yes, i know, but i wanted salad too.\"  He said, \"Oh, ok.  I can go get that right now.\" as my pasta dish was sitting there getting cold.  I told him forget about it at this point my entree is here already.  Apparently it was the end of his shift and he was more concerned about cashing his drawer out than waiting on us.  Then he was a douche on top of that explaining that it was \\'OR\\' even though the friggin menu had a comma which indicates AND!!  All the while making me out to be some kind of retard.  Anyway, having a father that is an Executive Chef from Italy and growing up in the restaurant business, I know that THE CUSTOMER IS ALWAYS RIGHT!  I won\\'t be going to that dump anymore!

When we notified the manager, she said thank you but didn't take any action like talk to the server or offer to take something off the bill or give us a dessert, which most restaurants will do.

The table was only about 15 feet from the bar, where the wait staff was constantly coming and going with food and drink orders. It is impossible that no one noticed her.\\n\\nA few moments after I arrived, our water glasses were filled, bread was set out and we were told our waitress would be with us in a moment.

We found the restaurant's decor impressive however this restaurant demonstrates really bad waiter service and probably acts of greed. It's a disgrace that this restaurant is serving as a living representation of Taiwanese culture.\\n\\nFirst of all, the food is decent enough considering that it is away from the Bay Area, which thusly does not introduces competitive Taiwanese restaurants. If this restaurant were in the Bay Area, the restaurant would be sure to go out of business. At the restaurant, we ordered Stinky Tofu and it was unbelievable when we were given only 8 pieces for 5 dollars. That equals to about roughly 60 cents per piece. That is ridiculous considering the dedication and size of these pieces. Besides from that, we decided that the food is reasonable enough although it was smaller portioned compared to the Bay Area Taiwanese restaurants. \\n\\nThe waiter service as mentioned previously is horrible. The waiters offered no expression of gratitude for keeping them in employment. In addition, as we left, the waiter offered no thanks and greedily halted his task on hand and searched visually our table for our tips. This is ridiculous. I understand that the all people want money. Or else why work? The problem is that he doesn't mask his temptations and greed of money and plainly expresses it.\\n\\nThe decor in the restaurant is one good aspect of the restaurant. I found the restaurant rather comfortable and the television was conveniently angled so then the customers do not need to turn their necks uncomfortably. I loved the painting of Taipei 101 on the wall as well. The kitchen was opened to us and from what I see, the kitchen looks pretty clean.\\n\\nThe thing that makes me angry at this establishment is the inclination of the waiters to whites opposed to non-whites. The waiter offered better services to our neighboring table of whites however, offered less then decent services to us non-whites. We found this consistent throughout the restaurant. Now, I honestly don't care what the reason of discrimination may be but this is beyond acceptable.\", \"My friends and I were visiting Nola for the first time and decided to yelp a restaurant close by to our hotel. This place had pretty good ratings so we decided to give it a try. We were on a laid back vacation, we were all dressed quite casual.

Not found here, at our table at least. \\n\\nI ordered the shrimp and grits, which was said to be a favorite, and I was extremely disappointed. It was SO salty, I was only able to take a few bites and had to stop eating. I really regret not sending it back but the service made me feel uncomfortable. So I basically paid $26 for a couple bites of sodium enhanced grits. Taste aside, the portion was also saddening. You get a little scoop of grits covered in too much sauce. While taking our orders, the waiter asked us if we wanted soup or salad. Where I'm from, this signifies that it comes with the order. But not here. So each of us ordered a side and got charged $5 for it without even meaning to. \\n\\nAlmost everyone else at my table had ordered a burger, which they seemed to enjoy very much. It came with fries which also seemed to have endured a heavy hand on the salt. Their large burgers with fries were much cheaper than my tiny plate of shrimp and grits. \\n\\nSo to round it all up, my personal experience consisted of bad service and unsatisfying food.

The only kudos I can give is that the hot food I ordered from the kitchen came out in a timely fashion and steaming hot. Kudos to the people working behind the wall. Unfortunately, my family and I will never return here simply because the manager could care less that every, single non-hibachi table was miserable and waiting far too long for their food.

What we found was a pleasant but inattentive server and bus boys that seemed to be clueless.  The food was mediocre at best.  I had the poached pear salad.  The flavor was very good on the pears but for $8.50 I wanted more than 4 thin slices.  it was supposed to have smoked Gouda.  I think there was 6 pieces that appeared to be box shredded.  I could not find the craisins or walnuts and the greens were starting to turn brown.  My husband had the wedge salad.  Again, over priced for the quality and amount.  I had, as an entree, the Jumbo Lump Crab Cakes.  They had no flavor.  The mashed potatoes had a lump of cheddar in the center and were overpowered by Old Bay seasoning.  My husband had the Seafood Pescatore which he said was OK.  I will say the desserts where beyond excellent.  We were told they were homemade so KUDOS to the baker.  We shared a Chocolate Mint Torte.  My mouth waters thinking about it.  The server, while she was pleasant, came over to take our order and then we did not see her again until she gave us our bill.  We asked for flatware as our food was served with no implements to eat it with.  Had we had the set ups at arrival we may have had a luke warm rather than cold meals.

Worse dining experience I had in NOLA. To begin with, they're severely understaffed. This resulted in not only a long wait to order and be served your food at their lil bar stools, but also the food was cold. I had the jambalaya, which tasted like it was straight out of a Zatarran's box, which is fine if you weren't paying $10 for it. My mom had the grilled shrimp poboy. Much to her dismay the shrimp was not grilled and it was not large shrimp, but rather small baby shrimp. We never got a refill on our diet coke nor were we given water. Whatever you do, don't waste your money here at this tourist trap. There are plenty of other eateries to experience local fare\", \"We used to go to Landry's in the French Quarters. It was one of our go to places during Jazz Fest. We noticed that it has re-opened on the north east side of the Jax Brewery Building. It looked good because it had an upstairs and an outside seating that overlooked the Mississippi River. That was the pros. Now the cons. When the hostess seated us she cleared the table but never came back to wipe it. There were no place settings and no dishes. Even though they were not busy everything took forever. When the crab bisque came out it was lukewarm as was the char broiled oysters. The oysters were seasoned with  way to much salt. We ordered bruschetta six oysters 2 cups of bisque and a beer.

If i want to eat withvthe animals it should be my choice.', \"I loved going to Mirko when it was in Midtown, so I was thrilled when this location appeared just down the street from my house. That was, until I ate there. \\n\\nI've given this location lots of tries. Lots. And it always falls flat. My last experience is a pretty good snap shot of how it goes. We sit and wait for a server. And wait. Oh, and then wait. Once he or she arrives, we order drinks -- because we like wine. But any appetizers (and or the free dip they serve) arrives much ahead of the wine. So far ahead that we only order one drink, when we'd like two ... or three (don't judge, we walk there). \\n\\nThen, there's the dip. It's a white bean dip with rosemary and olive oil. The drip, usually the consistency of hummus arrives drowning in oil. Yuck. I order GF pasta with broccoli added and the broccoli isn't cooked. \\n\\nI don't think I'll be giving them any more chances.\", \"What in the bloody heck is this?  After reading some positive reviews on yelp, I decided to give phat bites a whirl. Upon walking in, I figured, okay, it's a hipster hippie kinda joint. Healthy, organic, vegan, inexpensive, right?  Nope. Dead wrong on all counts. Upon walking in, you just stand in a line. No menu. Nobody telling you what to do or where to go. And then when you finally order, you are told to order coffee separately. Wtf?  And then you have to wait in an endless line to pay. And then you have to wait at your table and wait for your name to be called. Then, to add insult to injury, the portions are TINY. I literally am on my phone looking for a place to eat breakfast... after having just finished breakfast at this joke of a place.  \\n\\nSo, if you are in the Nashville airport area and you are longing to pay ridiculous prices for mediocre service, mediocre decor, tiny portions and middling food, by all means come to this joint.

I have NEVER been to a business where the customer service was so terrible. First when I ordered the cupcakes I asked if they did a strawberry shortcake kind of cupcake ( this was for my sisters bday and she celiac and pregnant) cause that's what my sister loves and the girl said yes. I asked if the cupcake would have real strawberries in it and on top of it and she said yes! So I ordered them. I picked up the cupcakes 2 days later and as I walked in to get my cupcakes there were 3 people standing behind the counter talking and NO ONE acknowledged me. I had to say something to get someone to help me. I get the cupcakes and they look ok.. I figured the strawberries were on top as well the inside like the girl said but I didn't see any on top. Ok so I leave and when it's time to serve the cupcakes after dinner, we cut the cupcakes in half for everyone to try and just as I thought NO strawberries. Then everyone takes a bite and spits the cupcakes out all at the same time. It was crazy. The cupcakes tasted HORRIBLE!!!! I couldn't believe it. \\nSo I tried to call and speak to a manager and she wasn't there. The employee had no clue when the mgr would come in. So I called for 4 days straight and still no mgr was around to help me. They didn't even know her last name or any other way to contact her. I was furious. This place is terrible. When I saw the bad reviews I still took a chance to try them out. Well I guess I should of went with the reviews. I will NEVER COME BACK TO THIS PLACE AGAIN. I even have pics to show how terrible the cupcakes were. Terrible. Disgusted.\", \"I am very disappointed . It is because they treated me unfairly. A couple weeks ago,  I went there for the first time. I liked the food, so I told my friend to try this restaurant. Tonight, I went there again and I saw that my friends were there (They were located in two different tables). When I came into the restaurant, they were almost done. While I was enjoying my food with my family, they had finished. Before they left, the waitress gave them one big box full of clementines for free (It was given as a New Year's gift.) Also, my other friends (at the other table) received a free big box of clementines. My table and one of the other tables had paid the bill, the only table that got the free stuff was the other table and I did not receive anything. I saw that they still had many boxes of clementines. \\nI won't go back there to spend my money.\", 'I used to love coming to this place when I was a student at U of A.  Recently, I decided to take an out of state visitor there. The pizza was not at ALL how I remembered.  Either we caught the place on an off-night or the management has really taken a poor turn.  At the ordering area, the food obviously did not look fresh; it appeared to have been sitting there for many hours unrefrigerated before our arrival.  I hesitated but ordered a veggie pizza for myself and he ordered a hawaiian pizza.  It took nearly 20 minutes for our food to arrive, even though there were very few people in the restaurant.  When our food was finally \"ready\" it was cold and soggy (even though the pizza had ostensibly been warmed up).  It was the worst pizza I have ever had from anywhere in town.  Total disappointment.

The pasta and sauces are just so-so.  \\n\\nNow for the reason I will NEVER return.  I placed a phone order.  I was told twenty minutes.  I went to pick it up and got there 25 minutes after my call.  I had to wait another 15 minutes.  The restaurant was not that busy.  The man who rung me up and barely spoke English hovered over me while I signed my slip, to the point that I was uncomfortable.  When he saw the tip line had a zero on it, he huffed very loudly and gave me a dirty look like he wanted to fight or something.  If I was classless like him, I might have been upset and lost sleep over it.  But knowing I will never, ever return to this horrible place actually just made it quite funny.  And when I got my food home, it was again just bland and boring.  \\n\\nI do not recommend this place at all anymore.  A year ago, I might have.  Two years ago I always did.  Now I recommend you avoid the average food and horrible, horrible service and lack of basic human manners and respect at all cost.', 'SLOW EST BARTENDER EVER.

I went for the first time in a long time last night with a few friends and the experience was ice cold.  We go there about 50 minutes before close and were greeted by the manager with no smile and a warning that they closed in 45 minutes.  That being said, all we wanted was a couple drinks and apps.  We did not do any entrees much less any dishes that required any significant time or labor, wings, my bruschetta, and one dessert on top of 3 cocktails.  Server was nice enough and very polite about replacing my first drink which came out in a glass that was nearly cracked in half.  We paid our bill right as they locked doors and let our server clean off our entire table.  We were out on the patio, assuming that it was probably the best place to be if you were going to there a little past close.  Needless to say, the manager on duty came out moments later and proclaimed \"I\\'m lockin\\' up.\"  with no smile, empathy, remorse, or hospitality.  I understand you are locking the place down for the night AND that I am there past close... but if you want to send the right message... don\\'t be a jerk 15 minutes after you close and literally kick out all of your guests.

Sat nite for dinner is busy. \\nUpon entering, we noticed that there were several other groups waiting. We told the unsmiling hostess that we were a party of three.

Including the mashed potatoes which tasted like instant!). My guest was livid. \\nThe manager arrived and was somewhat apologetic. My guest begins a tirade of complaints and explains to the manager that she  won\\'t come here, as a general rule, becuz the place is always a gong show.

I would say that the generic schwarma carts all around the city are better and they are by no means good.

Had something weird looking in it maybe bacon, but absolutely no flavor. Cabbage was the same, just boiled. Not exactly sure why we had to wait 20 minutes for food that they popped in the microwave. I'm assuming at one point over the years they served cornbread, well no longer. My bf got fried fish and chicken; it all tasted like flour. The mac and cheese was super dry and burnt, and tasted like boiled noodles nothing else. Sweet potatoes are definitely from a can, probably why they taste so good in comparison to everything else. We only went here because we had a free gift card. STILL wound up spending like 20 bucks. Wasn't worth the drive we made half way across the city.

Any of the vegetables in any of the dishes including lo-mein weren't fresh. There was no flavor to any of the dishes, no spices, not even salted properly.

Candidly, I was too tired to argue with her as we had spent nine hours driving and I should have asked some questions so this is partly my fault - obviously the young lady at the front desk did a great job of making me feel like the was my fault.\\n\\nI will tell you this...Nick, the young man who helped us with our car and initial greeting outside was fantastic.  We had three experiences with him and he was amazingly helpful.

It just went downhill from there. I'm not even wasting my energy on typing anymore. I will never return to this establishment again.\", \"I would give it zero stars if I could. The employees looked liked they hated their lives and did not care. It's labeled as bbq, but elementary school cafeteria bbq is a far more accurate description.

It was 4:30 pm and we had just flown back into town. Decided to try the place because we see it all the time when we eat at Carrabas. We walk in and see one employee sitting at the bar --reading a paperback. He looks up and says, \"Oh, just sit anywhere. \". We sat ourselves and menus were brought to us. About 10 minutes later, he got up and asked if we wanted to order. By this time, we really didn\\'t, but were already invested in the bad experience, that we went ahead and ordered. The food took forever  and was horrible. The sauce tasted like someone opened a can of Hunts tomato sauce and poured it on the enchiladas. There were no refills of drinks, and I had to go get him (still reading his novel) when it was time for us to pay. I thought, \"What a slug\". Horrible service, horrible food, and horrible experience. The place was so mismanaged -- rest room was filthy, from training of employees to quality of food. It has the air of a place on its way out, rather than on its way to the top. I recommend that you avoid this place.', \"I normally give positive reviews on yelp because I think there is too much negativity in this world. However, I have not been to a McDonald's where the employees were more unpleasant, indifferent, or downright rude. Food is normal McDonald's fare, but be prepared for employees who obviously don't care about their job.\", 'Unfortunately a sad disappointment for a Sunday brunch. First time here after hearing this was a great place to come to enjoy a Sunday morning. The option to sit outside, sounded amazing however, we were left neglected. Waiting for along time for drinks, (approx. a 1/2 hour) food and service. For the price, atmosphere and service was not worth the effort to plan a Sunday here. Let alone, when leaving the restaurant was bare inside. Not sure, with the excuse they were short staffed by the server, where everyone was during our dining experience, not even apologetic nor a manger to come to check on the experience. Next Sunday, will be dining and recommending other options for a Sunday brunch.', 'We have gone here twice in about 15 months. The first time the food was less then favorable and the second time was today ( figured we would give them a second try-may they have gotten better) WOW was i wrong. We waiting about 15 mins to sit and there were tons of tables available... then when we were finally welcomed ten mins later..we were told our table was get cleared. After that we saw four people walk right in and get the table \" which was being cleared for us\" ... horrible service.. no organization and from the smell... the food hadn\\'t gotten any better. So we went down the road to oaks cafe and a place, and the service...awesome makes you feel like a customer... would never go back to wildflowers again! Thumbs down.!!\\n..', 'My wife and I stopped by the past Sunday (Memorial Day Weekend). When my wife asked the server as to a possible available table? (larger young woman with black hair) she launched into a stern warning that we \"better not sit at any table that hasn\\'t been cleaned!\" Taken back by this attitude by the server we complained to the bartender ( blond hair) about the server\\'s behavior and she first placated us but then began to gossip about us to another woman helping her at the bar. We left without finishing our drinks. Oh, and the anemic jazz band was inaudible!', 'I want to make clear that my review is based only on the sandwich bar (deli) at Dorignac\\'s. I went there based upon the 4.5 star review hoping for a great little sandwich place in the Metairie side of town. The grocery store looked pretty great, but the sandwich bar on a Saturday at lunchtime was abysmal, and the worst place I\\'ve paid money to eat since moving here several weeks ago. \\n\\nThe service consisted of \"What do you want?\" followed by the staff contuing their conversation and offering no help at all. The turkey sandwich my wife bought was shaved lettice and tomato on a plain white hamburger bun. Hardly worth the $7 we paid. My \"hot sausage po boy\" was some kind of pressed mass of orange meat with more shredded \"lettuce\".  The only redeemable thing about the whole meal was the package of cole slaw that made it edible. If you\\'re looking for a grocery store, definitely check it out; but if you\\'re looking for a sandwich or a po boy, pass it by. It\\'s an amateurish half-hearted attempt.', 'What do we have here?

The deal is valid tuesdays only and only if Monday night football total score adds up to 51 points..which it did. The girl who answered had not been trained in telephone ettiquite. Rude and yelling to a manager or another associate if they had heard of the deal. Both employees had no idea what I was talking about and she said \"no we don\\'t do that. Bye\"\\nClick. Hung up. No suggesting another deal, no \"can I get you anything else\" just bye, click.

The GM of this location called me and wanted to make things better after my first review. She offered me a free order of whatever I wanted and promised they would do right by me. Pleased with this communication, I made an order a few weeks later, but when the delivery arrived, it was wrong (yet again). I got a regular 2-Liter Coke, instead of Diet Coke. The driver said he had a diet coke in the car, then I watched him drive away. I was not sure if he was coming back! About 15 minutes later, he showed up again with a diet coke for me. I have literally ordered from this location three times, and each time have been disappointed. \\n\\nMy recommendation? Order from another Domino's location, or drive yourself there to pick it up.

Have been there before ( prob 2 years ago) thought it would be a nice  inexpensive meal. I love chicken rice and beans. First of all the man that took our order was rude. Should have been the first clue. Ordered the 1/4 chicken,rice and black beans. The rice was dry and hard as well as the chicken that was also dry and little meat, also had the ice tea. Sad to say the ice tea was the only good thing. Looked for a clean table but they all appeared to need a good cleaning. Neadless to say I will never go there again.

I had the roasted marrow.  It was a mess, two large segments of bone one having a core that was smaller than my little finger with nothing to extract the marrow.  I finally got a small spoon but had to use the handle to dig out the grossly undercooked marrow.  The other piece of bone had a larger core but it too was undercooked.  I haven't had marrow before but my understanding is that it is supposed to slide out of the bone.  Not even close.  I had ordered escargot as an appetizer and they had a metallic taste with undercooked garlic in the butter.  My wife ordered the shrimp with grits and the shrimp (all four of them) were tasteless but the grits were terrific.  My dish came with a salad which was adequate but not tossed.  Anyway, I'll stick to breakfast which I have had before and is quite good.\", 'This was the first time at this location and we put in an online order. After we got home and opened our food we realized the guac was old. We each got a scoop on our entrees and an extra cup of it for our chips. We werent even able to eat our meals because of how grossed out we were. The guac which should be a very vibrant green was dark brown. I called them immediately to let them know.  The gentleman whom I first spoke with and ask to speak with a gentleman told me they were busy but he would get her.  REALLY! He then came back on and asked me what it was in reguards to so I told him. About 3 minutes later the manager picked up and simply said \"hello\". She didnt introduce herself, didnt appologize for the hold, or anything. So I then said , \"Hi, did the gentleman tell you why I am calling\" and she said no he didnt. So I explained to her again. She told me the guac was made last night and thats why it looked that way and that I can come back in for a refund... So many things about this expierence and this phone call were so wrong! This manager needs to be put through customer service training. And if the guac really is made at night, that is gross! It should be made daily as it goes bad very quickly! I will not be returning to this location!', 'I have to admit I\\'m surprised by my experience. When I saw this place had over 200 ratings and a 4.5 average I expected something more than what I got.  I ordered the falafel platter which came with Tabouleh salad, hummus, mixed vegetables & a side of pita.\\n\\nAs a whole, everything seemed to be at least a day old. Everything was very stale and just did not feel right as you attempted to chew it.  If I ever storm a castle and have archers firing at me from atop a tower, I would like to be wearing armor made from the falafel because I would be unstoppable.  The pita, I would not serve to small children nor the elderly because it\\'s a choking hazard. It had the consistency of that fruit leather you used to get from the cafeteria in elementary school. \\n\\nYou know how if you put a lot of sugar in your coffee people make that joke \"You want some coffee with your sugar?\" Well that\\'s what they would say about the amount of parsley in the Tabbouleh.  I understand Tabbouleh is supposed to have a lot of parsley, but this was to the point where I couldn\\'t call it Tabbouleh.  They just gave me straight up minced parsley with a countable amount bulgur grains that seem to have accidentally fallen in.\\n\\nThe hummus was not that bad. It tasted like it had a bit too much lemon juice going on and maybe could have used a bit more tahini, but overall it was just ok.\\n\\nThe overall taste of everything was not bad, but it did not resemble anything that I would call close to good. Think of a delicious cheesesteak from Pat\\'s or Gino\\'s or Dalessandro\\'s that\\'s a day or two old.  It would taste like it\\'s a day or two old, but you could still tell that it would have been delicious had it been fresh. I can\\'t say that with the meal I just had from Smiley\\'s.  It didn\\'t taste bad like I could not stand putting it into my mouth, but I can\\'t say I found it even pleasant. I\\'d get as excited for it as I would for a plain bowl of oatmeal made with water.\\n\\nI think I rate very fairly and it hurts me that I have to give this establishment such a low rating. I will admit that there is a possibility that, given the other stellar reviews, I may have just had a rare bad experience. Unfortunately, that is all I have to go off of. I may try it again some day if I\\'m with somebody who really wants to go there.  Until then, no thanks.', \"I'm done with this place.  They have a good selection but there employees are infuriatingly inconsistent.  When they get a rare item, they will lie to your face when you ask for it.  Friends would get a beer there, tell me about, then I would go and they would say they never got it in.  When I call them out on it then its unsurprisingly sold out.  This has happened more than once.  One time I came back and tried again and then they had it.  I am not giving them my business again.\", 'I waited 25 min for two appetizers.

I know a great water bagel when I taste one. However, I bought a half dozen cinnamon raisin bagels that tasted like onion. The first one tasted like onion. I thought that it, perhaps, came in contact with an onion bagel; no problem. The 2nd one tasted like onion & I thought then that they didn\\'t properly clean their oven. After tasting the 3rd bagel, I called them to ask for 6 more. Well, the owner was angry & inappropriate. He sniffed each of the 3 bagels that I returned & said, \"they don\\'t smell like onion!\" (Accusing me of lying?! Really?!?!) I would have simply apologized & replaced the 6 bagels...that simple. He said, \"you take bite, you taste onion, you bring back!\" I tried to explain that I thought it might have just been the one bagel. He got angrier & forcefully threw the remaining bagels in the trash before handing me a new bag of 6. Well, he lost a loyal customer for nothing!!!!!!! BEWARE; do not cross the boss!!!!!', \"Ordered a bacon cheeseburger from here earlier today. First off, it was $10 including the cost of a side of fries, which was steep. I wouldn't have really cared if the food was good, but it sucked. The patty was overcooked and was like rubber, while the bacon was under-cooked. Also the lettuce was wilted af. And they used mozzarella instead of yellow cheese. Like, wtf. Just terrible. I threw it away after three bites. And the fries sucked as well. I should have went to McDonald's.\", 'This place sucks.

When she finally did she brought 2 of the 3 of us water but never brought me a glass (and I was the one who ordered Nashville hot chicken). The food was average.

It is one of my favorite restaurants and I drove over half an hour to eat there with two of my friends on Thursday may 31st. Our servers were Tracey and mikayla, whose was training, and I was extremely disappointed in the service that we recieved.\\nI'd like to highlight first the some service that met the outstanding expectations that I know olive garden expects.\\nWhen we arrived we were seated right away and our server in training introduced herself fairly quickly. We were given adequate time to look at the menu and make our selections. Our first round of salad and bread sticks, along with our appetizer very quickly. After this though the whole atmosphere and attitude seemed to change.\\nOur tray of breadsticks and salad stood empty for almost 20 minutes after that initial  round. One of the reasons I love olive garden is because of the refills on salad, soup, and breadsticks. While we waited on someone to recognize that we needed refills, a tray of dirty dishes sat out in the dining room for approximately 30 minutes across from our table. Our main courses came out before our second round of salad and breadsticks and when I recieved my entree the sauce in the ravioli de portabellas that I had ordered congealed and the entree was cold. I flagged down a server as no one had asked us how are meal was. Although my meal was replaced with no question, it came out after both of my friends were finished eating and had recieved to-go boxes, so I was eating my meal alone. After we were all done eating, everything was boxed up, and dishes were cleared we then waited over another 15 minutes for my dessert to-go and our check. Finally when we did receive our check it was the wrong one. Thankfully I was planning on paying with a credit card so I didn't just leave money on the table and walk out. \\nAgain I am very disappointed in the service I recieved tonight. The problem with our service is that there was no direction from the server that was training the new employee. Tracey seemed to be more worried about a large party that was sitting behind us but made a point to mention in passing that mikayla better do good tonight because she was making her money. Now I understand the basis behind why trainees give their tips to their trainer, as I went through the training myself, but tracy was not guiding her, checking on the table or shadowing her anyway. I feel like mikayla was sent out to the wolves with no food.\", \"We purchased the 8 piece fried chicken from the deli at 5:45pm. We assumed the chicken would be fresh since it was dinner time.

One thigh was dried out and was missing the crispy skin. It was just a piece of almost black dried meat.  We couldn't eat half the chicken it was so bad.

I thought 30 minutes was a little excessive but figured they were probably busy with dinner service. So I arrive to pick up my food about 35-40 minutes later. Not one car in the parking lot, not one person in the restaurant area and I'm told my food is STILL not ready. I ended up waiting an additional 15 minutes for a piece of grilled chicken and a COLD sandwich. The grilled chicken should not take too long on the grill and the other sandwich didn't even require cooking!! The girl at the front desk was not apologetic at all. The cook came out 3 times to talk/flirt with the girls at the front desk. All around it was very unprofessional. \\n\\nSo I get home to try my sandwich and was not pleased at all. The grilled chicken sandwich was literally a piece of flavorless chicken served on a hamburger bun. Yes, a hamburger bun. The other sandwich was not for me but I had to try it. Again, flavorless. I will not be going back here ever again. For the record, this was probably my 3rd or 4th time ordering from here only due to the fact that it's right down the street from me, and every time I've had to wait a long time for food and/or the food was not good. I've eaten at the other location in Conshohocken before and have been pleased but this location is horrible. Save your time and order elsewhere.\", 'Wow, really bad gumbo. My partner started with the seafood version, but the seafood tasted old and there was no other flavor to it other than the roux coming through. A very kind waiter exchanged it for the ya-ya, but this too was flavorless! Even the andouille had no flavor whatsoever!  Just more roux taste. We had to abandon it. \\nTheir famed BBQ shrimp were ok ... flavorful spices mixed into otherwise pure melted butter, how could that be so bad?\\nGet out of the Quarter and go eat for real.', 'Went there for lunch before they moved locations and myself and husband were pretty impressed.  Just think about how excited we were to hear that they were now open for breakfast at their new location! \\n\\nWe visited there on a Sunday morning for breakfast.  Husband isn\\'t home that much due to work so we wanted to enjoy a sit down breakfast together before running our errands for the day and thought we would try out the new breakfast menu (Belgian waffle with side of bacon for me and Disco Ball for my husband).  Walked in to no line at all and placed our order at the counter.  Went around to pay, grab our fruit tea, and took a seat.  We looked around and noticed what appeared to be a couple people (I\\'m assuming at this point) ordered food after their group did.  Didn\\'t really think anything of it.  After approx. 20 mins, my name is called. They put my Belgian waffle down (no sign of side of bacon) and tell us that my husband\\'s meal is right behind them.  My husband didn\\'t want my food to get cold so told me to go ahead without him.  I ate my ENTIRE waffle and he still didn\\'t have his food.  Plates were slowly making their way from the kitchen to the other people\\'s tables. My husband still waiting for his.  I finally go to the counter and ask about his plate.  They hand me a plate that was sitting on the counter and says \"Breakfast takes longer to cook.\"  Ummmmmmmmm....ok..  They didn\\'t seem apologetic in the slightest even though I told them that I\\'ve already finished my breakfast.  I took his plate to him and went back up for my side of bacon.  He literally finished his food before my side of bacon was brought to the table.  His food was cold and the look of the meat on his plate was questionable.  The quiche was pretty good though!\\n\\nNeedless to say, our planned nice sit down breakfast together turned out to be far from our expectations which included a price tag of $30.  If you go for breakfast and plan to eat TOGETHER...you may want to take a snack to eat while others in your party enjoy their plates one by one.', 'Terrible experience. Waited over an hour for our food when the restaurant was empty then waited an additional 45 minutes to get the check. We asked them to split our check four ways (like it says on the menu) and gave a written breakdown of each check. The waitress came back with one large check after we gave her a breakdown of the bill TWICE. Then she proceed to complain about having to divide the checks. We asked for itemized copies several times and never got them.

Broth wasn't bad, but very salty. Noodles were so-so. Pork belly and egg were the best part, cooked deliciously!\\n\\nI rate this place low because the pricing is ridiculously high for ramen ($14) Also, we omitted the duck from the fried rice and they still charged us full price!. :(\", \"Easily the worst Wingstop I've ever been to.

It took 50 minutes for our food to come out, with no apology.  My meal was cold.  I informed the manager of our long wait and cold food, and although she offered to comp my meal, she did not offer any other solutions or see if I wanted anything else.

The brisket and pork with both extremely bland with absolutely no smoke ring or smoke flavor. In fact they tasted boiled. I can't understand how this could be if that meat was in fact inside a smoker. \\n\\nThe two sides were both bland as well. I looked hard and couldn't see any spices in either of them. I then moved on to the original wings. Again, the meat was bland with no seasoning and what tasted like a bottled BBQ sauce.

None of us ordered anything fancy- chicken fingers, a wrap, a sandwich. At 6:50 our food finally came, and we quickly had to scarf it down in order to leave. (We did let our server know we were headed to the movies after dinner, there was only 5 of us) This was extremely disappointing, even though they offered is boxes to take with us...which honestly, we couldn\\'t even do since we would be at a movie for a few hours. \\n\\n\\nWe expressed our disappointment to the \"Manager,\" who never even looked up, made eye contact, or engaged in a conversation when we shared with her our experience. All she said was \"I gave you a little something off\"- Which was $1.50 off the entire check.

However I didn't know that I couldn't get my phone back or at least a refurbished phone at the same value of what I owed.  Basically if I would return my iPhone 8 to go back down to iPhone 7 then I will get a new iPhone 7 and restart not only the contract, but sadly start at zero again which means the iPhone 7 will cost me $800.  So let me think about this I can return my iPhone 8 and go back to iPhone 7 for $800.  Sounds like a deal right?  At least I could of been informed before making the deal.  Spoke to the manager Megan Rivas and she said sorry, but is the policy.  Sad how companies policies are set up to make money.\", \"The absolute worst restaurant that I have ever been to.

HORRIBLE! \\n\\nWe took a bite from 4 of our 6 cookies purchased, and found they tasted like rock hard sawdust. I am not kidding. I bake cookies myself, and I know that when you bake them fresh - DAILY - they should be moist and tender. Yes, they look pretty all dolled up in frosting and daubs of jam, but the flavor is absolutely flat - not a hint of butter or sugar in them. I guess they use lard? I also suspect that the cookies stored under the hot lights of the display case are not only dried out beyond repair, but were probably baked a good week ago. I broke a Cary cookie in half and it just shattered like glass! The cookie was dry as a biscotti, and tasted like some kind of stale dog biscuit. \\n\\nThese cookies are an insult to Josef (if he is even alive and cares what is baked and sold in his store). We will not be returning to Josef\\'s again for ANY dessert of any kind ever. I was so mad about these stale biscuit cookies I chucked them all in the garbage. Money down the drain. \\n\\nYou may as well get a small cookie or two at Whole Foods, or even a small box of infinitely fresher cookies at Trader Joe\\'s! Josef\\'s so-called Vienna Bakery is a total Fakery.', \"If I could rate this place any less I would. My fiancée and I decided to order through the Chili's To-Go option on their website. We showed up at the appropriate time that was designated for us, and absolutely nobody paid attention to us. No one greeted us, but instead decided to converse amongst themselves laughing and joking around. We waited for 20 minutes with a waitress who continually walking passed us without a second glance so we left. I would recommend going to any other chili's except this one if you want a good experience.\", 'I have been to this Starbucks multiple times and everytime the same thing happens, they make drinks out of the ordered in which they were received. This last time was my absolute final straw with this location. The woman behind me had order 5 drinks and had gotten all of them before me, as well as the 3 people behind me. When I asked if my order had made it through because the people behind me had gotten their orders, the man behind the counter said oh yes it is right here is is coming up. Well, 3 more orders later, again from people who order after me, I finally received my iced coffee. And it only took 20 minutes to get. I would definitely advise anyone to purchase from a nearby Starbucks rather than this one.', \"Could contend for the best thin in STL if they would give you an option to have something other than that awful provel cheese.

First, they flat out lied to me that they could not validate my restaurant.com certificate. My bad, I guess I should\\'ve listened to the one yelper that shared the same experience. Don\\'t bother ordering $10 shrimp tacos, the shrimp are flavorless and the \"soft corn tacos\" were an abomination that I really don\\'t know how to describe properly. I had heard such great things about their ceviche, so i decided to order the campechana. It is now sitting in my refrigerator until I figure out a way to salvage the shrimp from that disaster. The octopus is a total loss though. If you don\\'t know how to prepare octopus without turning it into shoe leather,  do not serve it at your establishment. I honestly feel embarrassed for these people. I\\'m pretty certain it\\'s generally a bad idea to throw some seafood in a cup with a bunch of ketchup and sugar, and have the balls to think that it\\'s ok. If I could give negative stars, I would. I hope this place shuts down. The only positive is that my senior citizen relative enjoyed the asada burrito.

Our table of four was expecting a fabulous experience in a classic Italian setting. What happened was quite the contrary. The service was untrained and uneven. The main course came before the appetizers (the amount of mussels for cost was pathetic). All of the orders had food delivered incorrectly and had to be taken back for adjustments. The \"steamed\" vegetables were raw, the Mahi Mahi was so dry it couldn\\'t be swallowed. I sent my dinner back refusing any more indignation and was still charged.

I decide to take a trip there to see what's going on (since my credit card was charged). They said they just opened, even though the website said they've been open since noon. Ok, looks like a glitch in the system that left me hungry. No problem, you would think they would try and resolve the issue by offering to make the food, or giving me some sort of discount/credit/whatever to make me happy. Instead the guy grabs the order off the printer and says I need to call their online ordering vender to get my money back. Talk about terrible customer service. They are destined for failure.\", \"OMG. I finally gave it a try and what a waste of my time! Me and my significant other decided to give ourselves a break from looking at houses for hours.

We never got our drinks we ordered with my sweet tea. All the manager could say was the bar is backed up I'm sorry. We never got our apps or any other food. Only the sweet tea in 45 mins. No drinks we ordered or anything else. Our server walked around like she wasn't bothered and didn't have a care in the world. Just taking a stroll around the area and had such a calm passive attitude about how long it was taking. Horrible first experience.

I do not recommend this place as after the hot water disguise as coffee was replaced with the French press that too is hot water disguised as coffee.

Ultimately, Xochitl gets one star because I do not have a \"no star\" option.  My friend and I dined here last night for restaurant week and had really been looking forward to it.  Neither of us had been before, so we thought Philadelphia\\'s Restaurant Week would be a great place to give it a shot.  WRONG.\\n\\nWe arrived on time for our 7 pm reservation and were asked to wait in the bar area until our table was ready.  Not a problem.  And understandable on a Friday evening. Although the restaurant was not at capacity we didn\\'t think twice about being asked to wait. About five minutes later, we were seated and our very nice server came to explain the menu and the customizable guacamole.  \\n\\nWe made our guacamole selection and placed the order for the remainder of our 3 courses.  As far as the food goes, the guacamole was the best thing we had.  I ordered sangria that was supposed to have peaches, but instead had grapes and apples.  I\\'m not saying that\\'s impermissible, but it\\'s totally different.  Lol.  Just saying.\\nAnyway, from there, the courses went down hill.  The four cheese empanadas were a bit undercooked.  My main course, which the waitress described as their signature dish, was ok but did not make a real impression.  And the dessert....the churros.  I thought that was a safe choice.  WRONG.  They\\'re probably normally excellent, but when I bit into it instead of the lovely, sugary sweetness that I was expecting, I tasted onion and garlic and lots of other savory spices.  Perhaps they had a shortage of oil in the kitchen.  Who knows?  \\n\\nBUT HERE\\'S THE REAL PROBLEM: Our waitress brought us the bill and we were winding down when the manager, Adam, came over to our table and said, \"ladies, I hope you\\'ve enjoyed yourselves and that you will come again.  If you\\'d like to continue enjoying yourself, I suggest you go to the bar, but we need the table.\"  Now is probably when I should point out that there were other vacant tables in the dining room and that the couple next to us was in the process of leaving, But I digress.  Apparently there was some special reason why he needed our table.  So we proceed to stare at him like he was crazy.  He took that as his cue to continue talking.  He said, \"we\\'ve been TRYING TO WORK AROUND YOU, but you\\'ve been here for THREE HOURS and we need the table.\"  We had not been there for three hours, it was slightly over two, and it was a four course meal. Moreover, we had to wait for our table.  Ultimately, however, if their primary concern is just turning tables and not providing a nice dining experience, then they shouldn\\'t be in the restaurant business, nor should they participate in Restaurant Week.  \\n\\nWhen we started gathering our belongings, my friend asked the manager to move because he was blocking her chair.  After which he said, \"I don\\'t allow people to talk to me like that.\"  This was unbelievable.   I have never been treated so poorly by a staff member at a restaurant...EVER.  I would not be able to recommend this establishment to my worst frenemy.', \"The only reason I'm giving them a 1 rating is because they don't have a 0 rating. This is the second time I've ordered from here, and the last time. Both times were disasters. Today, I ordered a Turkey & cheese hoagie with banana peppers and yellow mustard. The counter lady was very rude and acted like each customer was an annoyance. After waiting 15 minutes (for a cold cut hoagie, may I add), I finally got it. But it wasn't what I ordered. It had sweet peppers and honey mustard. I then proceeded to say that I ordered banana peppers, in which the rude lady quickly said that they didn't have. SO WHY DIDN'T YOU SAY THAT WHEN I ORDERED?!!?!?! I would have ordered something else. Rudest lady I've ever met. If this place didn't have such a great location, it would become bankrupt.

I have had chicken and beef fried rice many times in my life and there was no way that was fried rice. More like warmed up/steamed plain old white rice that was clumpy and hardly had anything in it. There was no vegetable in the rice. I honestly don't know what that was. I tried the ginger beef and it was way overly spicey and soggy. The egg roll was soggy as well and seriously had nothing inside it besides bean sprouts that tasted really bad. Not what i would call an egg roll.

By this time the bartender (subbing as a waitress) was becoming visibly agitated with my persistent requests.  I was planning to order 2 additional prime rib dinners to take home to my husband and son-in-law, but I wasn't about to give this place any more money for their poor choices and now an attitude from a food server.  So I phoned in my order to the Outback Steakhouse where (for the same money) we got our choice of potatoes, AND choice of vegetable, AND we also got warm baked bread.\", \"John Asshole (it shows up as John A so who really knows) says anyone that has a negative review about this place must be stupid.  Sorry Mr Asshole, but I know good food and this isn't it.  Frozen pizza dough, canned sauce, greasy cheese.  What else is there to say.  If you want to order from here, might as well go to craptastic places like Dominos, Little Caesars, Pizza Hut or Papa Johns.  I personally like my pizza hand made.  So I probably won't see John at Franks, Vinnies or Guiseppes....\", \"Just no. Expensive. And crap. I don't believe 10 bucks a pound for crawfish is reasonable. Bye Felicia.\", \"On Dec. 26, my wife and I had 6PM reservations at this restaurant... supposedly a more casual version of the mother restaurant, Galatoire's, right next door. We had intended to have take part in their Reveillon special... a fixed menu that many New Orleans restaurants run from Dec. 1st - 31st... we were pretty much dressed business casual... but I did have on black jeans... there is no dress code there, but we looked pretty good. My guess is the awful waitress thought we were tourists (we live less than 4 blocks away from the restaurant) and for some reason, she didn't want her table taken up by us... even though the place was pretty empty at the time... this witch of a waitress flat out lied to us, saying that Reveillon had ended on Christmas at their and all of the other restaurants... we were quite mystified but accepted it and left... ended up eating sushi at at little place on Decatur. \\n\\nAnyway, while planning our New Year's Eve, I had been looking through Nola.com and discovered that Reveillon was indeed still going at not only Galatoire's 33, but all the other restaurants. This despicable waitress (I wish I could remember her name) at this over-priced restaurant deserves to have its business go in the take... the laughable kicker in the whole situation... my wife is a best selling travel author (numerous travel guides to her name, including a best selling New Orleans guide for Moon Handbooks). Don't give you business to this snobby, greedy restaurant or its mother restaurant... don't support anyone that would lie to customers simply to keep their tables open for someone who would pay their high prices vs going with the fixed meal price of Reveillon... pathetic!\", \"Quality and food selection = 5 stars\\nCustomer service = 0 stars\\n\\nA quick stop here after a Blues game for a munchie turned into one of the rudest customer services I've ever experienced.\\n\\nI stopped in their bathroom first and was disappointed to see that there was not a hook to hang my purse.  Seeing no other flat spots, I sat it on the floor before realizing the floor was soaked with some kind of liquid that didn't appear to be clear.  I quickly snatched it up, finished and went out to grab what I needed.\\n\\nWhile checking out, I told the cashier that their restroom wasn't very clean and it needed immediate attention.  He stared straight through me like I was crazy and only talked to my husband.  He mumbles he was going to pass along my concerns to the lady running the self-check out, we see him telling her and she literally just stares me down.  I said aloud that if my purse is discolored I would be back the next day to complain and they continued to stare at me.\\n\\nI have never had more rude customer service than I did tonight.  I am not a stranger to retail an usually you are told the customer is always right and everything will be done to make sure they are happy.  I did not walk away feeling like this.\\n\\nLuckily this was just on the way home from a game.  I will probably not return to this one unless I absolutely have to.\", \"I am a regular customer at remedy however this location is horrible. They don't have enough staff in the back to get people's order out. I ordered and waited 30 minutes just for a take out. The worst part is, three people behind me had their ordered filled and mine was probably sitting in the back. The lady didn't even apologize, she just said.. We are busy but there was no line up. Frustrated.. Going to a better remedy location.  Avoid the attitude.\", \"I came across Newk's Eatery at the Lobster Festival that was held at the Kapok Tree venue in Clearwater. I read good reviews about the restaurant so I was glad to see them there. The food was very good especially the Shrimp salad that my new friend and I had. Plus the Lobster Bisque was excellent.\\n\\nHowever, the service was not. Closed to closing of the festival my friend who was a vendor there told me that they had lowered their prices. So I want over there. The manager told me the price for the shrimp salad went down to $7.00 from $10.00. So I purchased two of them. I should have been charged $14.00 plus tax. You would think so. Instead the manager charged me the full price and it came out to be $21.50. Big difference. I complained to the manager at the booth and she did nothing. I called the store later and spoke to Tim the manager on duty and explained it to him and he told me to call back on Monday. I call the store on Monday and spoked to the General Manager who happened to be the same person that was at the booth at the show and she said she would refund my money. I was only interested in the difference between what I was charged and what I should have been charged.\\nThe manager said she would give me a full refund. That was Monday. It is now Thursday and I am still waiting.\", \"Service is horrible. We called in a reservation but once we got there they said we would have to wait 2 hours to be seated. There were probably 4 tables seated in the restaurant. The host had the worst attitude and was completely rude and told me it didn't matter if I had a reservation. The next day I went and picked up an order since everyone kept talking about how good the food is. Walked in and was never approached by anyone. I had to ask someone to help me after a few minutes and she was worse than the guy that was rude to us the day before. After looking at me up and down and giving me a dirty look she got my food and cashed me out. I asked her for a receipt and you would think it was the end of the world. She went in the back and didn't come back for almost 10 minutes with my receipt. The food was ok. I will never go back to even try the rest of the food and will be sure to let everyone else know to not waste their time on that bs.\", 'I really wish I could base this review on the food, but I didn\\'t even get a chance to order.\\n\\nInitially, I looked at the menu for Mood Cafe, but accidentally called Desi Chaat House. I decided to just roll with the mistake and order.\\n\\nAfter picking up the chaat from Desi Chaat House, I thought, \"Damn, that Dhokla chaat on Mood Cafe\\'s menu sounded bangin\\' and I could eat 3 orders of chaat by myself!\"\\n\\nI call Mood Cafe and no one picks up. Maybe, they\\'re busy.\\n\\nI go inside and there are two customers sitting down awaiting their order.

The woman at the counter is one miserable specimen.  It used to be one of my go-to places for cheesesteaks.  I frequently traveled from South Philly to buy sandwiches, but on my last few visits, the experience was horrible.  There is a new cook who simply is unskilled or uncaring about making sandwiches.  This lack of skill or disdain shows up in the quality of the food.  The woman that takes the orders gets more miserable by the visit.  The cook has changed and it is not for the better.  My last visit I had a confrontation with the cook about pickles on the side.  Even the other employees seemed embarrassed that this was going on.  If you have heard of Larry's reputation for great food, please move on.  That day has passed and the customer service absolutely sucks.  It's sad to see a well regarded establishment come to this!  I read in other reviews that the management changed and it has.  When the Girard Avenue store opened, I thought it was a lousy place to be piggy-backing off the Larry's name, but now the 54th Street store has fallen to its level instead of the other way around.\", \"This review won't make much of a difference because it's IHOP, however I have to express how terrible this IHOP location actually is. I have been to this IHOP on 4 separate occasions and every single time there has been something wrong with my order. IT WAS ALWAYS WRONG, EVERY TIME. The international house of pancakes shouldn't be screwing up pancakes. When I order sausage they give me bacon. When I order chocolate chip pancakes they give me blueberry. Missing eggs and hash browns, I could go on....I can't tell if its a language barrier or laziness but this location has screwed up both my dine-in and take-out orders literally every time I have given them a try. How many times can one apologize for incompetence? That location is mostly for the guest at the adjoining hotel, locals know better. I won't be going back. The location a few miles down on veterans is much much better.\", \"Apparently a call ahead isn't what I thought...according to the turning point. Although, another review states otherwise. I called ahead, (90 minutes prior) and arrived and was told it would take an hour to be seated. I was a bit confused and asked why so long, and the hostess said the call ahead didn't really matter, it takes into affect when I arrive....that made absolutely no sense. I left. I have been here before and the food was okay, not the best and two wait an extra hour after my call ahead and getting the response from the host was unacceptable.\", \"While the pizza here is good and the delivery is speedy, this restaurant's customer service skills is lacking, to say the least. Today I ordered a pizza and a two liter soda paying $2.50 for the soda for the convenience. The delivery person forgot my soda and said he'd be right back. So I waited....after 20 minutes I called the restaurant. The man who answered made it sound as if it was my privilege to wait. Of course, the delivery person had other deliveries so I would have to wait. Which I did....after 30 minutes I called the delivery person who also made me feel like a dick for being upset that they got my order wrong and that they made me wait. He still had not gone back to Allegro to get my soda (which was only 8 blocks away). So I waited....50 minutes later my soda arrived.\", 'On recommendation of hotel staff we ordered pizza.  EXTREMELY disappointing. Pizza was a lot smaller than expected due to its oval shape. We ordered 2 large pizzas -1 well done with extra cheese. Apparently  their pizzas are made without pizza  sauce . The extra cheese that we ordered was non existant & the cheese that was on it was a orange cheese. The under crust looked & tasted undercooked, bland & tough. I should have checked YELP reviews before wasting almost $40 on this place.', 'Have really enjoyed the food here before today....bbq pork sanwich meat was barely warm and chicken tortilla soup was all broth and needed seasoning...very disappointed', \"Nice quaint place, but WAY overly priced. I filled my 64oz growler and it cost $28. Keep in mind prices vary on the beers so it can range. I definitely didn't pick anything fancy or rare. I tried this place because it was close to home; first time fill here. I would stick to the local breweries to fill, it is MUCH cheaper. Catalina brewery is $16, the barrio is $12, tap & bottle ranges around $18. Bartender was friendly enough,  but I won't be back to fill, which is unfortunate because it is called Growler and close to home. Bummer.\", \"Worst orange leaf. Haven't been to this one in years but decided to give it a shot. Same. Not flavorful froyo, almost too cold to taste anything.\", \"We had some catering ordered by our Company from this restaurant. It was Baked Ziti with Cheese and Meatballs with Garlic Knots. The Garlic Knots were alright, and their pizza may be good, as I haven't had any I can't comment. What I can say is that there pasta sucks, the meatballs taste like they just bought them at a store and stuck them on top, and they used almost no pasta sauce, like 3 cups per 10 lbs of pasta. Wouldn't eat it even though it was free, certainly wouldn't spend any money there.\", 'I love the menu,but im a local an i been here many times and there is never a good satisfying  good welcome or would u like to oreder!! Nothing not even a hi! Just a straight face!! Love love the items on the menu!!! But costumers service sucks !!!    \\n Worst part!!! When i ask for a container to go! The cashier did not even bother to strive to make up for the straight face! Without a word she just pointed at the to go containers!!!!', 'Almost an hour and a half for delivery of one pizza pie. Check out the receipt and time on the adjacent iPhone. We were all disappointed with the speed of delivery. We understand pizzas can take a while to make and get delivered but an hour and half for delivery in the same town? Not good.', 'Had dinner on Friday night and we were charged $3 for 3 pieces of bread to start with. Our server decided to wipe her mouth with her fingers and proceed to cut our bread and serve. Ordered the Maddon special chicken parmigiana and eggplant. Was small portions and pasta was small portion. Then watched the head chef (in white coat) stick his finger in his mouth and then proceed to pinch seasonings and add to food while cooking. I would never go back. Plus we came all the way from Chicago!', \"I used to LOVE going to India Palace for their lunch & dinner buffets. I would say in the past year, the cleanliness and customer service have declined immensely. We've had the same server the last couple times we've gone, and he's been incredibly RUDE, impatient and disrespectful. We're never asked if we would like anything other than water to drink. We have to chase them down for refills when we manage to get sodas ordered. Plates are grabbed before we're finished. IT'S BEEN TERRIBLE! I've been going here for almost 6 yrs but its time to find a new Indian Restaurant because its just not worth the drive or time anymore.\", \"I've never felt the need to write a review until now... Was super excited to try this place with some coworkers one day last week. Arrived just after noon. There were 4 other tables and then us. It took 15 min to be offered anything besides water. We said we were n a bit of a hurry and would like to order. 10 min later he came back so we actually could... Another 25 min later when we were still without food ( salads and a flatbread and simple sandwich) we asked that our food be packaged to go.  Sadly the poor service (empty water bottle, forgotten ice tea) didn't stop there. The salads were not the ones we ordered and we were missing a sandwich! Looks cool on paper and at the actual location but I would recommend this place to an enemy. The food and service were sad.\", \"Very disappointed. I looked online at the Krispy Kreme menu and figured out the assorted dozen I wanted with my girlfriend. I go to this place, and like nothing is there. OK - I understand some sound a bit more specialty, like chocolate iced raspberry filled, double dark chocolate, cinnamon apple filled, and powdered blueberry filled. But they literally didn't have ANY powdered sugar donuts at all, no maple glazed anything, no lemon filled anything. And when I commented about them not having much, I got attitude back from the girl behind the counter telling me they had everything except for maybe one or two donuts. It's one thing to not have many routine donuts. It's another to have bad attitude. But to have both? One star it is.\", \"I come here every year on my annual road trips to Florida because gas is cheap at the Flying J, and it amazes me that every time I come it takes them FOREVER!!!!!! It's McDonalds people not a gourmet meal.. There is nothing fast about it. Pretty sure I could get a meal at Cracker Barrel next door in the time it takes them to make my number 4 sausage mcmuffin meal.. The slowest service I have ever had at a McDonald. And that includes the south where they typically move super slow. To give you an idea I'm writing this review while I'm waiting in line and still haven't even ordered. What gets me is that it is every year!!! I keep waiting for them to get better one year but it never happens..........\", \"This used to be our favourite sports bar. However in the last six months the service and food has gone extremely downhill. In December my family and I came to have dinner. At this time we waited at least twenty minutes to get help and then we're told that she was really busy. There were two other tables in the whole restaurant... We ordered chicken wings and a burger at that time with a salad for our daughter. My husband can't have seeds and asked for a different type of bun or two bottoms.. they go back and forth on whether or not they will even allow us to have two bottom buns, this night it was a no. They gave us a stale and burnt bun after they forgot about his order all together. My daughter and I were done eating prior to him getting his food. The manager gave us a 10% off coupon and when we tried to use it tonight they wouldn't allow it. After everything in the last six months, we will not be back and would highly recommend you go somewhere else.\", \"Although people say they have good burgers, I wouldn't know,  since I couldn't get in to try them without waiting an hour and a half! And you can't make reservations either! Ridiculous! Go across the street to shake shack and save some money and no waiting.\", 'This restaurant was probably the worst dining experience I ever had in Tampa!   Bad food, bad service and outrageous prices!', \"This shop was one of the worst I've ever been to. I called in advance to make an appointment for a simple oil change. When I brought the vehicle at 10:45 for an 11:00 appointment it took over an hour just to get it into the garage. It was not completed until 1:00 and at that time the cashier told me she doesn't know how to process a fleet vehicle and would have to wait for a manager. She then said the manager is on a conference call which usually takes about 30 minutes. Poor service and concept of time. I will never be back to this shop and if you cherish the time in your day I suggest you don't either. I would have given them negative stars if it was possible. Oh yea they also charged $98 for the oil change and new wiper blades.\", \"If you have a lot of time on your hands to wait for run of the mill food then this is the place.  Went there once and it took 30 minutes to get food but that was Saturday morning and the place was full so, ok, it's not Mickey D's amirite? But (sadly there is one) Monday morning with the place 1/2 full took almost an hour to get some really runny eggs, a cup of grits with a skin, and to be informed that the bagel with cream cheese we ordered was going to be plain because they were out of cream cheese. They comped the bagel.  Too many other really good places in the area to go back there.\", \"Been over an hour and still no delivery. Called them and they said they already came by. Clearly they had not. I definitely wouldn't try them again.\", \"Very rude manger, prices are exaggerated...been going there for 2 years. Food is a hit or miss. Never taste the same.

Train your wait staff so they know the menu', 'Still terrible. I had a late breakfast here and did not even have to wait. I still disliked my food and thought the prices were outrageous. Home fries are still delicious. Pancakes are still garbage. $3 plastic sausages are garbage. Service is still garbage. \\n\\nAbout the service. I ordered grits with cheese with my pancakes, sausage and home fries.. Do not order the grits with cheese. The \"cheese\" is a piece of Kraft American cheese cut up with a knife and put in a lump below your grits. The grits aren\\'t even hot enough to melt the cheese fully and it is disgusting. The grits themselves are OK, but the cheese absolutely sucks and it costs extra.\\n\\nAnyhow, I got my grits and my waitress said, \"Check to see if there\\'s cheese in there\". So I put my fork in there and mixed around the grits. I did not see cheese. She said, \"oh, sorry, I mixed this one up.\" So she picks up my grits, walks over three tables and SERVES THEM THE GRITS THAT I HAD JUST PLAYED WITH. She then picked up a bowl of grits FROM THEIR TABLE and gave it to me. Not exactly like sneezing into something and serving it to me, but damn close. \\n\\nJust go to IHOP.

Never before has an establishment aggravated me so. It is a 90 minute wait to get in. They said we will call you when table ready. We got in after 1 hr wait. During that hour we sat in a hot entry way with a squeaky door..no air condition with weather in hot humid 90s. After 45 mins, I ordered coffee from walk up bar.  They got it wrong..has to wait to remake. There was water pooled up in front of coffee station..no one was mopping it. Finally get seated outside counter. We gave order right away because we wanted to check in at our hotel and enjoy some pool time.  We waited, waited, waited..after 1 hour we asked for manager...They finally brought food like 1p min later. The manager was nice, took 25% off..gave us coupons for next time but we won't be back. Our server gave us tude when she brought bill and upon our leaving. I normally do not complain but although the food is supposed to be part of Nashville's finest, the management here is severely lacking to keep up with demand. Tgey also should afford air condition. We finally got to our hotel pool at our $400 a night hotel at 3p because of this place. Thanks Milk & Honey for ruining a huge part of our Nashville vacation.\", \"Wow.. Haven't had sushi this bad in a long time.\\n\\nWe got take out and ended up throwing most of it out. Much of the fish was extremely fishy and inedible. We ordered an octopus dumpling appetizer that was dense and mushy. The octopus itself had a strange flavor. \\n\\nHighly disappointed. Especially given all the positive reviews. Although north Tampa is probably the worst place for food I've in the country. Im from the midwest; NO COMPARISON.\", 'I will never eat nor order takeout from this establishment again! This restaurant is walking distance from my office so after having ordered takeout several times before some colleagues and I decided to walk over and dine in since the weather was so nice. Big mistake! We barely sat down before being asked for our orders, when told we needed more time the waiter rolled his eyes at us and walked away. He proceeded to be curt with is throughout the duration of our meals. Never once were we offered refills on drinks, our plates were not cleared upon finishing and one of my colleagues had to ask for a takeout container 3 times. To top it off the cashier was taking phone orders, seating guests and ringing up the checks at the same time. I get that it was during the lunch rush but there is no excuse for rude behavior when I am spending money in your establishment. Hire more help! I will not spend another dime here!', \"I've never thought Fulin's was that bad...until today.   \\nThe menu's are DISGUSTINGLY sticky and in need of wiping down.   The window by table looks like two year olds rubbed their dirty hands all over it.   Our waitress attire looks like she never washes it...by the way she's served us before with dirty clothing so it's her mojo.  The first two sushi's were okay but something seemed to be lacking in taste and the presentation was... nothing...usually sushi is presented quite beautifully.  \\nBut we ate it and wondered if we were ruined since we had sushi at a new place in Murfreesboro that was over the TOP delicious and fresh.   So we went on and ordered a third sushi.   The waitress served us the third sushi with the oddest hesitation...the sushi looked awful.  The menu never said the seaweed paper was on the outside.  It said it was served with avocado and one tiny piece of avocado was on ONE slice.  It was suppose to have Roe and it was nowhere to be found.  So we got the menu and proceeded to complain to the waitress as we felt it wasn't clearly explained what we were getting.  I honestly now wonder if the other two sushi's were even prepared correctly.   I had tasted one bite of the scallops sprinkled over the top and it was sooooooo dried out and disgusting.   My husband tried a slice of the roll.  He doesn't like seaweed on the outside to begin with but he said he's had better at the grocery stores (which is usually very bad).  So that's how low this place has gone.   Fulin's need a serious makeover and management that wants to serve good food.   You've lost two customers.\", \"We came here because it was dog friendly.  I thought that was pretty cool and wanted to try it and also I can bring my four legged son. But it was all down hill from moment we sat down.

When we finally got our food our drink was half way gone and waiter didn't even ask if we wanted a refill.  So we waited and no one came to check on us. My husband actually called the restaurant ask for a manager and said we needed a refill and our waiter hasn't come to do refill it. Manager Amy apologizes and finally our drinks came.

In my first two visits during the Spring, the bartenders were nice, friendly and welcoming. This past Fall and Winter, the staff made me feel like an imposition.

One gentlemen had to ask numerous times to pay his tab (it was not busy). This was my last try at The Black Sheep and will stay with Twenty Manning Grill.']\n"
